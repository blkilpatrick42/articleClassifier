Charlotte Korte says women in her New Zealand survivors' group have contemplated suicide because of the excruciating pain they suffer [Courtesy: Charlotte Korte] Glasgow, Scotland - Sleep is often a blessed relief for Nancy Honeyball. In a life filled with pain and discomfort, the 48-year-old's only escape is the opioid painkiller, Tramadol, which can sometimes render her bedridden for 18 hours a day. For the Scotswoman, there are few comforts in a day-to-day existence that, as a married mother-of-two, was once full, happy and pain-free. "I'm always in pain," said Honeyball, who lives with her husband, William, in the seaside town of Dunoon, Argyllshire, on Scotland's west coast. "The tiredness just takes over - which is [largely] to do with the medication I'm on. And I can't do things in the house that I used to do." Honeyball blames her excruciating bouts of ill-health on her vaginal mesh implant, which was fitted back in 2010 to remedy her urinary incontinence. Over the past seven years, however, her life has been plagued by repeated urinary tract infections (UTIs). They are so severe that they have caused her crippling lower-back pain. In one of several emergency hospital visits, in October, she was hooked up to a morphine drip. The mesh implants stretch, they fray, they become quite hardened and they pull on nerves. Wael Agur, consultant urogynecologist with NHS Scotland Transvaginal mesh implants, the use and associated risks of which were debated in the UK parliament on October 18, have been used worldwide to repair weakened or damaged tissue that has caused pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence - common conditions in women who have given birth. They are usually made from synthetic polypropylene. In the UK alone, more than 100,000 women have had mesh implants over the past two decades - including more than 20,000 in Scotland where, in 2014, the then Scottish health secretary of the devolved Scottish government wrote to health boards requesting the suspension of mesh devices after a successful petition by campaigners. For many, the procedure has proven successful, but for others, such as Honeyball, lives have been put under strain. "The mesh implants stretch, they fray, they become quite hardened and they pull on nerves," Wael Agur, a consultant urogynecologist with NHS Scotland and lecturer, told Al Jazeera. "They become a tough structure in a sensitive area that needs to move … Although these complications are rare, it's a lifetime risk - anyone can develop any complication in their lifetime if they've had a mesh implant." Survivors' groups The mesh controversy has spawned survivor's groups across the world. Maria Smit, who is Dutch, cofounded a campaigning group, MeshedUp. She said that her life was destroyed after being fitted with a mesh implant to solve a prolapse of the rectum and bladder nearly 10 years ago. Married with three children, she told Al Jazeera that the post-operative complications surrounding her mesh surgery have caused her to become an "invalid". "And while doctors attempted to remove parts of the mesh, it has become hard and is situated close to vital parts of my body." We have people in our group that are contemplating suicide. They have literally gone from really healthy people to being completely incapacitated Charlotte Korte, cofounder of Mesh Down Under Because of this, no other doctor has dared make further surgical interventions. "I'm in pain every day - all day long," said the 57-year-old, who lives in Helmond, southern Netherlands. "The pain leads from my bottom, the vagina, my groins and my hips into my legs. The nerve pain and the muscle pain dominate, but the pain in my bottom - where the doctor inserted the arms of my mesh - is also severe." Women across the world have reported similar crippling side effects, including a loss of normal sexual function. Indeed, some male partners of women fitted with mesh have even reported being injured by the device during intercourse. As such, legal cases brought about by women claiming to have been maimed by vaginal mesh implants have piled up over recent years. In the UK, one in 15 of those fitted with the most common type of mesh have required surgery and more than 800 women are taking legal action against the NHS and companies which manufacture the devices. In the US , some 100,000 legal cases have been filed, and in Australia , more than 700 women have launched legal claims citing bodily injury from implanted mesh. Charlotte Korte, a 46-year-old New Zealander who cofounded Mesh Down Under had an implant for a prolapsed bowel in 2010 and suffered complications. Since the group began in 2012, membership has leaped from 90 in 2014 to almost 500 people today. "We have people in our group that are contemplating suicide," said Korte, who has two children. "They have literally gone from really healthy people to being completely incapacitated." Manufacturing company defends use Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson, the biggest mesh implant manufacturer, said it "empathised with all women suffering from pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence, conditions that can be serious and debilitating". The company, which has been the subject of several legal cases, told Al Jazeera: "There are limited treatment choices for pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence, including surgical treatment with implantable mesh, which is backed by years of clinical research and can be the preferred option for some women seeking to improve their quality of life. "Ethicon [a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary] is confident in the positive impact our pelvic mesh products have had on the vast majority of women who have chosen this treatment option. The use of pelvic mesh devices is supported by medical experts, medical societies, physicians and regulatory organisations around the world." While campaigners hailed the October 18 UK parliamentary debate as a breakthrough, the government rejected a call from activists such as Kath Sansom, founder of the British-based Sling the Mesh group, for a public inquiry and suspension of surgical mesh, so that the rest of the UK could fall into line with Scotland. As for Nancy Honeyball, she is pinning her hopes for a recovery on a mesh-removal specialist in London. But in the meantime, the pressures of life and her continuing inability to properly function on a day-to-day basis remain. "My dad is 88 and has just been recently diagnosed with Parkinson's [disease]," she explained. "He [lives] over an hour from me, but I can't just jump in the car and go and visit him like I used to … My dad relies on his faith, and when I've stayed over there I've heard him praying. And he's praying for me." Follow Alasdair Soussi on Twitter: @AlasdairSoussi SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Health Europe US & Canada New Zealand
RenderPagesVideo('5626738587001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); US President Donald Trump has declared the country's opioid crisis a "public health emergency", but stopped short of issuing an order that would allocate more federal funds to address the epidemic. Opioids are a type of drugs that include illegal substances, such as heroin, and legal painkillers - medications such as oxycodone, codeine and morphine are all types of opioids. "Effective today, my administration is officially declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency under federal law," Trump said during a speech addressing the issue on Thursday. "I am directing all executive agencies to use every appropriate emergency authority to fight the opioid crisis," he said. "We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic ." According to the latest figures from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , deaths from opioid overdoses - either prescription or illegal - have quadrupled in the US since 1999. The CDC recorded 33,091 deaths in 2015. Since 2000, more than 200,000 Americans have died from overdoses of prescription opioids. Redirecting funds Trump has been under increased pressure from those on both sides of the political spectrum to fulfil his campaign promise to do more to address the opioid epidemic. {articleGUID} In August, the president said he would declare the crisis a "national emergency", but on Thursday backtracked on that promise, instead calling the crisis a "public health emergency". The difference between the two has to do with how and what funds can be used. Had the president declared a "national emergency" under the Stafford Act, agencies would have gained access to additional funds via the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund, which is typically used in cases of natural disasters like Hurricanes Maria and Irma. Instead, Trump chose to direct the Department of Health and Human Services to declare the crisis a "public health emergency", which only reallocates already-existing grant money and eases certain policies to help combat the problem. It also expires after 90 days, but White House officials have reportedly said this could be easily renewed. According to local media, the effort will initially be funded through the Public Health Emergency budget, which contains less than $60,000. Trump issued an executive order in March that set up a commission to examine the national response and make recommendations about how to tackle the issue. In July, the committee said that the administration should "declare a national emergency under either the Public Health Service Act or the Stafford Act". Trump said he expects to receive the final report from the commission next week and will begin implementing its recommendations as soon as possible. 'Weak and insufficient' Al Jazeera's Kimberly Halkett, reporting from the White House, said that some in the US consider Thursday's announcement a "good first step". {articleGUID} "But at the same time there is a little bit of disappointment, and even some criticism because of what this doesn't include - extra funding that would have come with the national emergency declaration," she added. A number of Democrats called Trump's announcement on Thursday "weak" and "insufficient". "While the steps outlined by the president may be helpful in some instances, without robust and dedicated funding, health care providers, treatment facilities and others working on this multi-faceted crisis will be hamstrung in their efforts to protect American communities from the scourge of opioid addiction," Congresswomen Rose DeLauro and Nita Lowey said in a statement. "Further, mere shifting of already insufficient resources threatens to hamper critical investments in other forms of health research and treatment," the legislators added. Trump outlined a number of ways the administration will seek to combat the crisis, including working with health professionals across the board, as well as drug enforcement agencies. According to US media, the administration is expected to work with Congress to set up additional funds to help address the crisis during the end of the year budget negotiations .

More than 600,000 Rohingya have been forced to seek shelter in Bangladesh [Soe Zeya Tun/Reuters] Bangladesh is planning to introduce voluntary sterilisation of Rohingya refugees, nearly a million of whom have been staying in overcrowded camps in Cox's Bazar district near Myanmar border. Pintu Kanti Bhattacharjee, who heads the family planning service in the district of Cox's Bazar, said on Saturday that there was little awareness of birth control among the Rohingya. "The whole community has been deliberately left behind," Bhattacharjee added, citing a lack of education in Myanmar, where the Rohingya are viewed as illegal inhabitants and denied access to most services. Bhattacharjee said large families were the norm in the camps, where some parents had up to 19 children. More than 600,000 Rohingya have been forced to seek shelter in Bangladesh after their homes and properties in Myanmar were destroyed in arson attacks over the last months, straining resources in the impoverished country. {articleGUID} Hundreds of Rohingya have been killed, women have been gang-raped and large swaths of Rohingya villages have been burned down by Myanmar soldiers and Buddhist mobs. The latest arrivals have joined hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees who fled in earlier waves from Myanmar's western Rakhine state, where the Muslim minority has endured decades of persecution. Most live in desperate conditions with limited access to food, sanitation or health facilities on the Bangladesh-Myanmar border, and local officials fear a lack of family planning could stretch resources even further. Large family District family planning authorities have launched a drive to provide contraception, but say they have so far managed to distribute just 549 packets of condoms among the refugees, who are reluctant to use them. The authorities have asked the government to approve a plan to launch vasectomies for Rohingya men and tubectomies for women, Bhattacharjee said. But they are likely to face an uphill struggle. Some of them told us that if a woman was pregnant, she had less chance of being targeted by the military or attackers. Rights activists Many of the refugees believe a large family would help them survive in the camps, where access to food and water remains a daily battle and children are often sent out to fetch and carry supplies. Others had been told contraception was against the tenets of Islam. Farhana Sultana, a family planning volunteer who works with Rohingya refugees in the camps, said many of the women she spoke to believed birth control was a sin. "In Rakhine they did not go to family planning clinics, fearing the Myanmar authorities would give medicine that harms them or their children," Sultana said. Volunteers said they struggled to sell the benefits of birth control to Rohingya women, most of whom came to them for advice on pregnancy complications or help with newborns. Sabura, a mother of seven, said her husband believed the couple could support a large family. "I spoke to my husband about birth control measures. But he is not convinced. He was given two condoms but he did not use them," she said. "My husband said we need more children as we have land and property (in Rakhine). We don't have to worry to feed them," she said. 'Pregnancy as protection against rape' Bangladesh has for years run a successful domestic sterilisation programme, offering 2,300 taka ($28) and a traditional lungi garment to each man who agrees to undergo the procedure. Every month 250 people undergo sterilisation in the border town of Cox's Bazar. But performing the permanent procedure on non-Bangladeshi nationals requires final approval from a committee headed by the health minister. The idea is particularly contentious given the sensitivity of the issue in Myanmar. The widespread perception that the Rohingya population is mushrooming is a key source of the tensions that have spiralled in recent months. No official data is available on birth rates among the Rohingya, who are excluded from the census in Myanmar. But many of the ethnic Rakhine Buddhists accused of taking part in attacks on Rohingya villages say they fear being displaced by the Muslim minority. The Rohingya face official restrictions on the number of children they can have in Myanmar, although this has not been widely enforced. Rights activists working in the camps in Bangladesh said some believed pregnancy provided protection against rape or other attacks in Myanmar, where the military has been accused of sexual violence against Rohingya women and girls. "Some of them told us that if a woman was pregnant, she had less chance of being targeted by the military or attackers." Bangladesh officials say some 20,000 Rohingya women are pregnant and 600 have given birth since arriving in Bangladesh, though this may be an underestimate as many births take place with no formal medical help. "Sterilisation of the males is the best way to control the population," said Bhattacharjee. "If a man is sterilised, he cannot father a child even if he marries four or five times."

Thousands of indigenous children were forcibly removed from their homes and placed with non-native families [Courtesy of Nakuset] Montreal, Canada - Nakuset knows just how different her life could have been. A Cree woman from Lac La Ronge, Saskatchewan, a province in central Canada , she was taken from her mother as a young child and bounced between relatives and foster homes. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5490753053001, 0, 0, 330, 186, "bcvid_5490753053001"); brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > Canada 150: indigenous people remember dark past PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY When she was three, she was adopted into a Jewish family in Montreal, nearly 2,500km away. "Being pushed into a completely different culture, I got all kinds of cultural shame every day. I was not allowed to tell anyone I was Native - it was a bad thing," Nakuset told Al Jazeera. For decades, she was cut off from her biological family, including her older sister, Sonya, who had woken up one morning in their foster home to find that Nakuset had disappeared without a trace. It took years for the sisters to be reunited. "Sonya looked for me, every single day, for years," said Nakuset, who now heads the Native Women's Shelter in Montreal. The 'disastrous' Sixties Scoop Nakuset was one of thousands of indigenous children who were taken from their families and Native communities across Canada, and placed into non-indigenous adoptive homes or foster care. The removals, which largely took place between the 1960s and 1980s, are known collectively as the Sixties Scoop. On October 6, the federal government announced it had reached a $640m agreement, in principle, with Sixties Scoop survivors across Canada who lost their indigenous identity as a result of the long-standing practice. Most of the indigenous children who were adopted or placed into foster care were never told about their indigenous roots. They lost contact with their families and communities and lost their language, culture and identity. While not all of the adoptive families were abusive, many children endured emotional, physical and sexual abuse and have suffered lasting trauma. Some went into homes across Canada, while others were removed to the US, UK, Australia and other countries. {articleGUID} Raven Sinclair, a professor of social work at the University of Regina and member of George Gordon First Nation in southern Saskatchewan, said child welfare officials literally scooped children up from First Nations reserves in some cases. "The system really took one look and said, 'Indigenous people can't parent, so the best thing for us to do is take these children away, raise them as white people, and then everything will be great,'" Sinclair told Al Jazeera. "And really that just proved disastrous." A Sixties Scoop survivor herself, Sinclair was taken from her mother when she was four after a neighbour called social services. She said she experienced physical and sexual abuse in her foster home. She explained that while she didn't suffer such abuse in her adoptive home, she was confronted with racism and bullying every day growing up. A "cloak of silence" has shrouded the Sixties Scoop for a long time, Sinclair said, and the federal settlement is "symbolic of an acknowledgement that wrong was done". Compensation and healing Under the settlement, First Nations and Inuit children who were taken from their homes between 1951 and 1991 will be eligible for personal compensation. The amount will range from about $20,000 to $40,000 for each person. Depending on how many claims are filed, it could add up to a total of $600m. Ottawa estimates that about 16,000 survivors will be entitled to a personal payout, but the government has not yet explained how survivors will apply for compensation or prove their claim. Another $40m will go towards establishing a foundation to help survivors heal, and $60m will be allocated to help pay for legal fees. Carolyn Bennett, the minister responsible for affairs between the state and indigenous peoples, said the settlement will "begin to right the wrongs" committed during the Sixties Scoop. The deal comes after a federal court judge ruled in favour of Sixties Scoop survivors in their class-action lawsuit in Ontario, Canada's most populous province, last February. At a national gathering for 'Sixties Scoop survivors in September, survivors were blanketed in a ceremony to welcome them home [Courtesy of Colleen Cardinal] The government failed to take steps to make sure indigenous children who were forcibly removed from their families did not lose their Native culture, language and identity, the court found. The federal agreement also puts an end to at least 18 class-action lawsuits that had been filed on behalf of Sixties Scoop survivors and were in various stages across Canada. "They have lived their lives not being able to be proud indigenous people," Bennett said about the effect the Sixties Scoop had on survivors. "They have lived their lives not having secure, personal cultural identity. That was robbed. Someone thought that a non-indigenous family somewhere else in the world was going to do a better job." 'Thousands excluded' Yet, not all Sixties Scoop survivors are included in the recent deal. The Metis fall outside the scope of the agreement, as do some non-status indigenous peoples (individuals whose indigenous status is not recognised by the government), provided that they are not eligible for status. The Metis have mixed indigenous-European ancestry and they are officially recognised as aboriginal peoples under the Canadian constitution, alongside First Nations and Inuit peoples. "It's like we're nobody," Gary Tinker, a Metis survivor of the Sixties Scoop, recently told CBC in Canada. "I'm glad for the First Nations, don't get me wrong," he said. "But they never even mentioned our Metis citizens who were in foster care." {articleGUID} Duane Morrisseau-Beck, cofounder of the National Indigenous Survivors of Child Welfare Network and a Metis Sixties Scoop survivor, said he felt like Canada "is playing divide and conquer" with the agreement. "This falls far from a national settlement and is playing out extremely negatively in the survivor community," Morrisseau-Beck said in a statement. Colleen Cardinal, cofounder of the National Indigenous Survivors of Child Welfare Network , said she had "very mixed feelings" about the settlement, in part since so many survivors are excluded. "For thousands of people who are excluded it must be very re-traumatising, once again to be left out of something so huge … They have to work so much harder to get healing and acknowledgement, which they shouldn't have to," the 45-year-old told Al Jazeera. 'We'll be here waiting' From Saddle Lake First Nation, just south of Edmonton, Alberta, Cardinal was a child when she was taken from her family and placed into an abusive, adoptive home in Ontario with her two sisters. Estranged from her adoptive family, and in only limited contact with her birth family, Cardinal said meeting other Sixties Scoop survivors and sharing stories has been invaluable to her own healing. That's why any sort of healing programmes coming out of the federal settlement - which should include a focus on indigenous languages and culture - must be survivor-led, she said. "We're at a start and I'm hoping that as survivors we can help lead the state into being accountable [and] being transparent for what they did," she said. Cardinal said a formal apology from the government would also help survivors heal, but it needs to be accompanied by concrete action. Sixties Scoop survivors, meanwhile, should know that they aren't alone. "I want them to know … that they can come home," Cardinal said. "We'll be here waiting for them."

Kashmiri protestors shout pro-freedom and anti-Indian slogans in Srinagar [File: Tauseef Mustafa/AFP/Getty Images] Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir – India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has appointed a former intelligence chief as an interlocutor to hold talks with "stakeholders" in Indian-administered Kashmir to find a political solution to the Kashmir issue. The appointment of former Intelligence Bureau chief Dineshwar Sharma, who has been tasked with holding talks with Kashmiri leaders, including separatists, is a break from the Modi government's hardline policy in the past three years. People in the Muslim-majority region see "little hope" of a breakthrough as similar initiatives in the past have failed to address the problem of Kashmir, which has seen an increased unrest in recent years. Earlier this week, India's Home Minister Rajnath Singh made the announcement about the appointment of Sharma to reach out to people in the disputed region, which is claimed by both India and Pakistan in entirety. After the 2016 bloody summer during which more than 100 protesters were killed and hundreds were maimed and blinded by pellet guns, people have little hopes. They are sceptical that it will make any difference on the ground. A Kashmir-based political analyst, Noor Ahmad Baba told Al Jazeera that the approach of the government headed by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the past few years has created a trust deficit among the common people. "Kashmir dispute is a complex problem and it cannot be solved by one person with vague political mandate," Baba said. "It is also important to know what kind of mandate the person has and with whom is he going to talk to in Kashmir. In the past, there have been many working groups constituted by the [successive] Indian government[s]. No one even touched their reports and recommendations, so it is not going to change much on the ground," he said. Trust deficit Pointing out that there is a resentment among the people, Baba said that the BJP government needs to recognise the political dimension of the Kashmir issue. The previous UPA government headed by the Congress party had formed three-member interlocutors in 2010 to hold dialogue with all sections of Kashmiri leadership, but their recommendations were not followed through. Khurram Parvez, a human rights activist based in Srinagar, says that the government should make the terms of reference clear as what the term 'interlocutor' means to Kashmir. "Many people came in the past for dialogue but nothing meaningful happened. If they will talk to the same people with whom Indian government has been talking to, the result is going to be the same," Parvez said, adding that the stakeholders in Kashmir conflict are India, Pakistan and separatists and if anyone of these is not consulted the exercise will be futile. Ghulam Muhammad, a resident of Kashmir’s main city of Srinagar, said that the appointment of interlocutor is "just a repetition of deceit, distraction and denial from the ground reality". "These things no longer excite or surprise any Kashmiri. These are the tricks of this government that has been dealing with civilian protesters with an iron fist and now they want to buy time from the ground reality," the 40-year-old said. The Indian government tried to send a number of delegations to Kashmir as part of its initiatives to stop the armed rebellion in the 1990s, when it was at its peak. The 2010 interlocutors group was appointed after five months of civilian uprising that claimed more than 120 civilian lives. The team comprising of Dilip Padgaonkar, MM Ansari and Professor Radha Kumar came up with a report, which was never taken seriously and the recommendations were ignored which created a trust deficit. Anti-militancy operation continues After Sharma's appointment as the government’s emissary, the army chief Bipin Rawat said that the step will not impact its anti-insurgency operation in Kashmir, referring to the continuation of its operation against rebels. Many believe that rebels are an important part of Kashmir dispute and any attempt made without their involvement is not going to bring any solution. "At some level, the militants have to be taken into consideration. They are not the problem but they are the product of the conflict, they need to be assessed and their problems need to be addressed," Noor Baba from the Central University of Kashmir said. The Indian security forces have launched a major counterinsurgency operation, which has resulted in killing more than 130 fighters and civilians this year, according to officials. On August 15 this year, on the India's 70th Independence Day, Prime Minister Modi insisted that "abuse and bullets' will not solve Kashmir issue, but "embracing Kashmiris" will do. But local Kashmiris say there has been no relief from the continuous bloodshed. "We have not seen anything other than the cosmetic treatment and now we don’t expect anything extraordinary this time," said Suhail Ahmad, a local resident. Long-pending dispute Nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan each administer part of Kashmir. Rebel groups have been fighting since 1989 for the Indian-administered portion to either become independent or merge with Pakistan. Nearly 70,000 people have been killed in the uprising and the ensuing Indian military crackdown. India maintains roughly half a million soldiers in the territory. India accuses Pakistan of arming and training the rebels, which Pakistan denies. Rebel groups have largely been suppressed by Indian forces in recent years and public opposition to Indian rule is now principally expressed through street protests.

Abu Mumin's role at Eden Care involves providing companionship to the terminally ill who have no family or loved ones to care for them [Photo courtesy of Eden Care] If the photos to the right of Abu Mumin are anything to go by, he saves his smiles for the people he is helping. Although far from curt or impolite in his demeanour, his voice carries a seriousness that is matched in his expression and body language, rarely fidgeting or breaking eye contact. Several pictures show him with a wide smile posing beside patients at their hospital beds. The social worker from London is part of an organisation called Eden Care , which identifies terminally ill people who have no loved ones to look after them and sets about providing them with companionship towards the end of their lives. As most of the people they work with are estranged from their families, their final weeks of life would otherwise be spent alone. 'Muslims who ended up having Christian burials' {articleGUID} At the group's office in the London borough of Tower Hamlets, Mumin sits on a small leather sofa besides a microwave box and a stack of documents and leaflets. The walls of the room are plastered with photos of volunteers with the terminally ill people they work with and others depicting funeral proceedings. "Our work involves intensive befriending," he explains, continuing: "We spend the evenings with them to give them company, we take food, do activities, we read the Quran, and even take them on trips to places they can't visit because of their physical disabilities." Most of the people Mumin and Eden Care help are Muslims, but the group also befriends people who are not. The organisation works with partners from other faiths to ensure those who are not Muslim have funeral arrangements according to their preferred rites. Converts to Islam, who are often referred to as "reverts" by Muslims, are one of the key demographics that Eden Care works with, and Mumin voiced concern that they were more likely to face difficulties towards the end of their lives than people who were born into the faith. "We get a lot of reverts who are often the only members of their families that are Muslim, so find themselves quite isolated and worried about what will happen when they die," Mumin says, adding: "We have had Muslims who ended up having Christian burials, for example." In such cases, his role takes on a more educative and legal dimension, educating next of kin about Islamic burial procedures and drawing up the necessary paperwork to ensure the dying are buried according to their religious tradition. "There have been cases where families insisted on a non-Muslim burial, but in others they have been very supportive because of the wishes of their relative," he explains. Drawing on personal experiences Mumin and the volunteers at Eden Care have helped bury 52 people since the organisation was established in late 2014, and have befriended many other terminally ill people. The Londoner of Bangladeshi origin drew on his own experience looking after his late mother when she was diagnosed with a terminal illness in the late 1990s. She was initially given six months to live, but went on to live a further 15 years after her diagnosis. When she died, Mumin felt the absence not only of a loved one, but of the lifestyle he had grown accustomed to while caring for her. "The day that my mum died, that part of me that I was doing before, I lost that," he reflects, adding: "What gave me peace was helping her ... A lot of the services [Eden Care offer] are reflective of our own experiences." Religious obligations But it's not just his personal experiences with his mother that drive Mumin. Religion plays an important role, too, especially Islam's invocations to look after the sick, and the communal requirement on Muslims to ensure that a fellow Muslim be buried according to Islamic rites. "Both historically and today, a funeral remains a social obligation, what is defined as 'fard kifayah' in Islamic theology," says Abdul Azim Ahmed, a researcher on contemporary Islam. "Like births and marriages, death is something that affects the community, and the funeral in the Islamic tradition reaffirms that while we are all individuals, we belong to each other in both life and death," he explains. Death and illness therefore take on a social dimension for Muslims like Mumin, rather than being of concern only to a small circle of family and close friends. The Grenfell Tower fire That ethos of social obligation meant that Eden Care was well placed to respond during the recent Grenfell Tower tragedy. Mumin and the group's volunteers have helped bury 12 victims of the fire, with several more funerals planned. The organisation has offered its services to both Muslims and non-Muslims affected by the fire, which left at least 80 people dead. There are also practical considerations driving the group's work. "By the year 2030, there'll be a quarter of a million Muslims over the age of 65 ... We need to concentrate on this issue of care," Mumin says, citing figures by the charity, Hospice UK. He warns that Muslims have been slow to respond to the growing need for care within the community and they need to act fast. "We need to be more interested ... This a multilevel issue, from graves, to care homes, to hospitals; we need to get thinking about how we're responding," Mumin says. To that end, Eden Care has been working with London Muslim Centre, one of the largest mosques in the UK, to host awareness events about end of life care. Despite satisfaction with the work he and Eden Care are doing, the toll of frequently burying people he has gotten to know over months and years has brought Mumin to the verge of quitting. "When I got to the 30th burial, I said I can't hack it any more ... This is hard," he says, explaining how he had decided to resign in the summer but reversed his decision after the Grenfell disaster. "I'm a youth worker, not a burial person, so every time I used to go into one of these burials I used to come out feeling exhausted and I would cry," he says. Mumin is one of 30 people at Eden Care, the majority of whom are volunteers. Their work has earned deep respect from locals in London but he concedes that the scale of their work is relatively small and much more is needed. "It's a duty ... but I just think we're scratching the surface."

Since December 15 an agreement brokered between Russia, Iran and rebel fighters to evacuate besieged communities in eastern Aleppo and the villages of Foua and Kefraya has been under way, albeit faltering at times owing to infringements of the deal. While the humanitarian crisis of Aleppo is rightly under the international spotlight, the wisdom of the evacuation deal has largely gone unquestioned. This is unfortunate because in many ways the uprooting of Aleppo's residents to Idlib is a case of jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire. Moving Aleppans to an already stressed area Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5254663457001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5254663457001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: UN passes resolution on monitors for Aleppo (2:19) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The evacuation of Aleppans will inevitably lead to their displacement in temporary shelters where they are more vulnerable away from their home environment and families. Idlib province is already struggling to meet the basic needs of its residents under the governance of deeply divided rebel groups. The transfer of 50,000 internally displaced persons could overwhelm local coping capacities, leaving both local residents and the newly displaced increasingly dependent upon the humanitarian system, while they both remain at the mercy of the regime and its allies as they make up their mind as to their next move. An International Rescue Committee spokesperson last week said that "escaping Aleppo doesn't mean escaping the war. After witnessing the ferocity of attacks on civilians in Aleppo, we are very concerned that the sieges and barrel bombs will follow the thousands who arrive in Idlib". Given that the international community has failed to stand with Aleppo at its time of need, there is no basis for thinking that civilians caught in the crossfire of renewed attempts by Russia and the Assad regime will fare any better. To turn the concept of evacuation for safety into a full-scale eviction of an entire community is totally unacceptable. While rebels faced a choice in accepting or rejecting a deal, the same is not true for residents of eastern Aleppo, some of whom at least are reported to favour remaining in their homes. This is made all the more so considering that the international community increasingly sees Bashar al-Assad as the lesser evil in the face of the al-Qaeda-linked Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly al-Nusra Front) which dominates much of Idlib province. A European diplomat is quoted as saying that "fighters had a choice between surviving for a few weeks in Idlib or dying in Aleppo". By extension, civilians evacuated to Idlib face the same prospect of buying time at the cost of their evacuation. Yet this stark warning presents a false dichotomy. There are other destinations that should have been explored for evacuees. Turkey has constructed camps for the internally displaced near its border within northern Syria, yet is allowing in only those in urgent need of medical treatment. The depravity of the situation calls on Turkey and other neighbouring states to act unilaterally to provide safe haven to displaced Aleppans. Meanwhile, the international community should have stood by the position where the evacuation is made to neutralise eastern Aleppo by offering safe passage to fighters and their immediate families, leaving their arms and ability to pose a threat behind. OPINION: The 'Palestinisation' of the Syrian people Ideally this would have been accompanied by a monitoring mechanism to ensure that the forces of the Assad regime and its allies respect international law as they enter the east of the city. To turn the concept of evacuation for safety into a full-scale eviction of an entire community is totally unacceptable. While rebels faced a choice in accepting or rejecting a deal, the same is not true for residents of eastern Aleppo, some of whom at least are reported to favour remaining in their homes. How should Russia weigh in?

The evacuation and subsequent destruction in 2006 of the Nahr el-Bared refugee camp in Lebanon led to a protracted displacement under which residents are still returning to their homes a decade later. Given that this double displacement occurred in a relatively stable context with high international support, the chances of a return to eastern Aleppo are vanishingly small. It is worse now because the fate of Aleppo's residents is tied to the destiny of other communities that will go through a similar ethno-sectarian uprooting. The Iranian intervention to tie the evacuation to the fate of Foua and Kefraya has complicated matters where there was an existing balance between the two villages and Madaya and Zabadani based on a gentleman's agreement between Hezbollah and the Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. OPINION: From the rubble of Aleppo, ISIL rises If anything, this shows that although Russia seems to have focused its mind on reaching a solution that meets its own objectives and has finally reached an understanding with Turkey, it has clearly underestimated the deviousness of the "deep state" in Iran, which hides behind excuses that it cannot control all of its militia on the ground. The Russians must tread carefully because where the war is fought on land and not in the air they will inevitably have less control over the situation. The United Nations Security Council's resolution that was unanimously accepted on December 19, establishing a monitoring mission, is a welcome development, albeit several weeks too late. Russia should now seek to play a proactive role in the monitoring to protect civilians and uphold its reputation in the region.

Elsewhere in Paris, and in London, Amsterdam, Oslo and Copenhagen, people demonstrated against the slaughter. Turks rallied outside Russian and Iranian embassies and consulates in Istanbul, Ankara and Erzurum. The people of Sarajevo, who have their own experience of genocide, staged a big protest. The protests are nothing like as large as they were when the United States bombed Iraq, but they are welcome nonetheless.

Public sympathy for the victims may have pressured Vladimir Putin to allow those in the surviving liberated sliver of Aleppo to evacuate, rather than face annihilation. At the time of writing, the fate of the deal is in doubt, subject to the whims of the militias on the ground. If it works out and the tens of thousands currently trapped are allowed to leave - the best possible outcome - then we will be witnesses to an internationally brokered forced population transfer. This is both a war crime and a crime against humanity, and a terrible image of the precarious state of the global system. The weight of this event, and its future ramifications, deserve more than just a few demonstrations. The 'war on terrorism' excuse The abandonment of Aleppo is a microcosm of the more general abandonment of Syria's democratic revolution. It exposes the failures of the Arab and Muslim worlds, of the West, and of humanity as a whole. Many Syrians expected the global left would be first to support their cause, but most leftist commentators and publications retreated into conspiracy theories, Islamophobia, and inaccurate geopolitical analysis, and swallowed gobbets of Assadist propaganda whole. Soon, they were repeating the "war on terror" tropes of the right. Victory for Assad is also a victory for ISIL. The Obama administration provided a little rhetorical support and sometimes allowed its allies to send weapons to the Free Army. Crucially, however, Obama vetoed supply of the anti-aircraft weapons the Free Army, so desperately needed to counter Assad's scorched-earth campaign. In August 2013, when Assad killed 1,500 people with sarin gas in the Damascus suburbs, Obama's chemical "red line" vanished, and the US more or less publicly handed Syria over to Russia and Iran. Keeping to the "war on terror" framework, the US bombs the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and others in Syria, hitting the symptoms rather than the cause of the crisis. Europe, meanwhile, declares a crisis over the refugees arriving on its shores. So long as Assad remains in power, most of these refugees will not return home. As for the Arab states, a combination of sectarianism, Iranian domination, and counter-revolutionary fervour led several to collude in Assad's war. Others supported elements of the opposition, but in a disorganised and tepid manner. ISIL and Assad winning The tragedy has also exposed the weaknesses of Syrian society, vulnerabilities which Assad so cleverly manipulated. By organising massacres (particularly in 2012, on the plain between Homs and Hama), by releasing Salafist-Jihadists from prison, even as he tortured and killed thousands of democratic activists, then by inviting in foreign Shia militias, Assad engineered a sectarian breakdown. Too many Syrians fell too easily into his trap. When, for instance, Zahran Alloush - founder of Jaish al-Islam and himself a beneficiary of Assad's prison amnesty - called for Damascus to be "cleansed of Shia influence", he played right into Assad's hands. OPINION: And who are we to say the Syrian revolution is dead? Yet, the revolution exposed strengths which Syrians didn't know they possessed. Communities held elections and organised themselves in local councils. They set up women's centres, independent trades unions and free radio and TV stations. Aleppo was by far the largest centre of such civil society initiatives. It's not surprising when conservative states allow a revolution to drown. It's more shocking that they stand idle as Arab sovereignty collapses. Assad lost the war he provoked. By September 2015, when the Russian bombing started, his depleted army held less than a fifth of the country.

When Russia arrived it employed the usual excuse - the "war on terror", in this case on ISIL, also known as ISIS - but less than 20 percent of its bombs fell anywhere near ISIL. Instead, its planes focused relentlessly on eviscerating the Free Syrian Army, as well as the civilian infrastructure in liberated areas. They burned schools, hospitals and markets. They dropped cluster munitions, incendiary bombs and bunker busters - banned in civilian areas - on residential blocks. These, too, are war crimes. The majority of the ground forces surrounding Aleppo are not Syrian. Most are Shia jihadists from Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, funded and trained by Iran. As well as these proxies, Iran has its own Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) in theatre, often commanding Syrians. In Iraq too, the sectarian Popular Mobilisation Units are under IRGC command. In Lebanon, the Iranian-inspired and funded Hezbollah dominates. Iranian expansionism accompanies the sectarian/political cleansing of areas of Homs and Damascus, as well as Aleppo, creating demographic changes which won't be reversed by another consignment of missiles. Victory for Assad is also a victory for ISIL. As Aleppo was being subjugated, ISIL retook Palmyra, capturing important weapons stocks. At the same time, an increasing number of Syrians facing sectarian aggression - though still a minority - are buying into the nihilist ISIL narrative. None of this stays in Syria. So how do the Arabs respond? Hamas organised a protest in Gaza, Kuwaitis demonstrated outside the Russian embassy, and Qatar cancelled its national day celebrations. It's not nearly enough. With good reason, the revolutionary thinker Yassin al-Haj Saleh wrote of the "Palestinisation" of the Syrian people. Sixty-eight years after failing to defend Palestine, Arab states have proved incapable of defending Syria from Russian, Iranian and ISIL occupation. They have, however, taught a repeat lesson to their subjects - that sovereignty is meaningless without democratic control. This imperative, which galvanised the 2011 revolutions, is today more relevant than ever. Robin Yassin-Kassab is the author of the novel The Road from Damascus.

A flood-affected couple sits along a flooded roadside under a picture of Jayalalithaa Jayaram, chief minister of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, on December 6 [Reuters] All the women who have become heads of government in India have been single. It's an unwritten job requirement. Indira Gandhi, who became India's prime minister, and Nandini Satpathy, Sheila Dixit, Vasundhara Raje, Uma Bharti, Mamata Banerjee, Jayalalithaa Jayaram and Kumari Mayawati, who served terms as provincial chief ministers, were unmarried or separated or widowed at the moment of their ascension and through their time at the top. Sonia Gandhi doesn't figure in this list because she didn't actually hold political office despite being president of the Congress Party when it led a governing coalition for a decade. Had she chosen to become prime minister, she would have borne out the rule. Women who rule in modern India can have no consorts. This is something of a South Asian rule. Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the modern world's first female head of government, became prime minister of Ceylon in 1960 following the assassination of her husband, Solomon Bandaranaike, during his term as prime minister in 1959. Her daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga, the first woman president of Sri Lanka between 1994 and 2005, was widowed six years before she became president, when her husband was assassinated in 1988. Begum Khaleda Zia, the first female prime minister of Bangladesh, was the widow of General Ziaur Rahman, president of Bangladesh, assassinated in 1981.

First of all, it testifies to the fact that politics in South Asia is savagely violent. It tells us that family connections in South Asia trump gender prejudice when it comes to high political office. This doesn't mean that South Asian electorates are emancipated in some feminist way. It means the reverse; they are so patriarchal that the charisma of a male relative can be posthumously transferred. A male politician can halo his widowed wife, his orphaned daughter, even his bereaved mistress, with political legitimacy, but this legitimacy comes at a price. The female successor must be publicly celibate. A woman who is a prime minister or a chief minister in the sub-continent can't - even by implication - be sexually active. She has to be neutered by singleness because sexuality in a woman isn't - as it is for a man - a sign of potency, it's a mark of weakness, of susceptibility. A public man is a statesman; a public woman is something else again. For a female politician to be virtuous she needs to be insulated from carnality by spinsterhood or widowhood. READ MORE: Jayalalithaa Jayaram dies at 68 There's another reason, unrelated to sexuality, that makes it almost impossible for a married woman to hold high political office. Since husbands in South Asia think they own their wives, a married woman is often seen as a puppet - not an autonomous political actor. This is the Lalu Yadav syndrome. The erstwhile chief minister of Bihar installed his wife, Rabri Devi, as a place-holder chief minister of the state while he was serving time in jail for corruption. Regardless of how charismatic or independent a woman is, the only way for her to escape the stigma of being a male ventriloquist's dummy is to dispense with men altogether. Bearing the male's legacy There are two exceptions to this rule. Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's first female prime minister, was married to Asif Zardari right through her political career. Sheikh Hasina, now in her second term as prime minister of Bangladesh, served out a full term as prime minister between 1996 and 2001 as a married woman. How did they sidestep the stigma of being sexed creatures, subordinate to a male keeper? It's worth remembering that while Benazir Bhutto and Sheikh Hasina weren't widowed, they were violently orphaned. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, prime minister of Pakistan, was judicially executed by the military usurper, Zia-ul-Haq, while Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated in a military coup along with most of his family. The springboards for their political careers were their fathers' "martyrdoms". Benazir Bhutto only ever referred to her father as "shaheed" (martyr) while Sheikh Hasina's entire political career as prime minister has been devoted to reinstating her father's legacy and punishing the individuals, parties and institutions that had conspired to murder him. It's curious that attempts of women to replicate the political authority that their male counterparts take for granted, should be gendered and then read as a peculiarly feminine failure to create a fraternal, rational politics. Each ruled, literally, in the name of their fathers. This single-minded fidelity to a dead man's legacy kept each from being owned in the public eye by her living male consort. While female heads of government in India have to be single, their public personas are shaped by the nature of this singleness. Widows with children are differently regarded from women who have never been married and who don't have children. Indira Gandhi, Sheila Dixit, Nandini Sathpathy and Vasundhara Raje were humanised by their families: A single woman with children can be placed as someone who was once a wife and is still a mother. Indians understand the web of family attachments that shapes a woman's life. They understand dynastic succession even when they don't approve of it. That Indira followed her father, Nehru, or that she wanted her sons to succeed her wasn't nepotism, it was normality.

Powerful, unmarried, childless women are seen as unnatural and, in the end, unnerving. Kumari Mayawati, Mamata Banerjee, Uma Bharti and Jayalalitha Jayaram, who have all been provincial chief ministers, have nothing in common except for the fact that they are single women. Mayawati is a Dalit woman from India's Western Uttar Pradesh region. Mamata Banerjee is a Brahmin raised in shabby genteel poverty who single-handedly saw off the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Uma Bharti is a "backward caste" woman who took her vows and became a jogin, a sort of Hindu nun. Jayalalithaa was an English-speaking Brahmin who first became famous as a film star in Tamil movies. And yet, if you were to trawl newspapers or news television for the way they are described, you could be forgiven for thinking they were a single person: an authoritarian harpy who rules via a cult of personality that reduces party colleagues to acolytes and policy to whimsical, self-aggrandising gestures. OPINION: Indian Muslim feminists - We are reformists not traitors The point is not that this description is inaccurate: Mayawati, Mamata Banerjee and Jayalalithaa did and do rule as party supremos with no peers; not for them the polite liberal fiction of being first among equals. Jayalalithaa required and received public slavishness from her ministers and party men and so, to a lesser degree, do Mamata and Mayawati. The sexism of this stereotype lies in the fact that these traits are seen as noteworthy in a political culture where the cult of personality is the norm and where the performance of deference is mandatory.

It's curious that attempts of women to replicate the political authority that their male counterparts take for granted, should be gendered and then read as a peculiarly feminine failure to create a fraternal, rational politics. The ease with which governments headed by women are seen as practitioners of "harem politics" where decisions grow out of intrigue, hysteria and suspicion, tells us more about the inadequacies of men than it does about the rule of women. The unnaturalness of womanly rule is experienced as the emasculation of men. Governments headed by women are disparaged as monstrous, because the men who serve in them are seen as political eunuchs. To submit to the absolute authority of a woman is to be unmanned. The triumph of women such as Mayawati, Jayalalithaa and Mamata is that they manage to beat the odds in a predatory male world to reach the top. To stay there, to deflect the sexist charge of being barren viragos, they have, ironically, to further deny their sexuality by recasting themselves as nurturing kin to their constituencies. It's not a coincidence that Jayalalithaa is Amma (mother) to her voters, Mayawati is Behenji (sister) and Mamata is Didi (older sister). Fictive kin roles normalise these remarkable single women. Their tragedy is that these are necessary avatars because no matter how powerful they become, the one thing they cannot be is themselves. Mukul Kesavan is a writer based in Delhi.

There are about 15,000 transgender people currently serving in the US armed forces [File: Reuters] A US federal judge has barred President Donald Trump 's administration from enforcing plans to exclude transgender people from serving in the country's armed forces. Trump had announced the ban in July, stating at the time on Twitter that transgender individuals would not be allowed to serve in the military in "any capacity" partly due to "tremendous medical costs". In August, Trump signed a memorandum laying out in more detail the ban, which was supposed to go into effect on March 23, 2018. But US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly on Monday ordered a return to the status quo before Trump had announced the policy, since the transgender service members who had sued the US government over the ban were likely to win their case.

According to the National Centre for Transgender Equality, there are about 15,000 transgender people currently serving in the US armed forces. "Grateful for such a clear, powerful ruling for our plaintiffs: no legitimate reason to treat #transgender service members differently," Shannon Minter, one of the lawyers working on the case, said on social media later on Monday. The news was welcomed by many other rights activists and opponents of the ban, who hailed the decision as a victory.

On October 31, Australia's offshore immigration detention camp on Manus Island will shut down. The controversial Papua New Guinea-based centre , dubbed "Australia's Guantanamo" by people living there, is currently home to about 600 refugees. Once closed, the detainees will be forced to move elsewhere - either to a different part of Papua New Guinea (PNG) or a different country. However, despite the centre's notoriety, its closure has led to criticism from both people within the camp and outside. What is the Manus detention centre? The Manus Regional Processing Centre is located on the small island of Manus, about 300km of the coast of the main island of Papua New Guinea. It is run by the Australian government in order to keep refugees out of Australia. People using boats to get to Australia's shores are stopped by the coastguard and subsequently sent to one of several detention centres, including in Manus. The facility on Manus was established in 2001, together with a detention camp on Nauru. While the Nauru centre houses single women and families, including fathers, the Manus one holds only single men. Both camps gradually fell into disuse and were eventually closed in 2008. But they reopened four years later, following a large increase in the number of refugees trying to reach Australia . {articleGUID} Australia, PNG and Nauru struck a deal under which the latter two would take in refugees from intercepted boats in exchange for money. For the Manus Island camp, the plan was to subsequently house the refugees in PNG if their asylum claim was proven valid. If not, then the refugees would either be sent back to their country of origin; or to a different country; or remain in detention indefinitely. The camp is run by Broadspectrum, an Australian company also managing the offshore detention centre on Nauru. Christmas Island, which is an Australian territory, hosts a third detention centre. What are the conditions in the detention centre? The Manus camp has been widely criticised since its 2012 reopening - just like Nauru. The United Nations and human rights groups have described conditions in the centres as horrid, saying that refugees living there are subject to "severe abuse and neglect". Since January 2014, there have been nine people held at the camps on the islands of Manus, Nauru and Christmas have died, according to Border Crossing Observatory, a Monash University-based research centre. Four committed suicide, while the rest of the deaths include one case of suspected suicide, one death as a result of violence and three cases of accidents/illnesses. {articleGUID} Last year, British newspaper The Guardian published files detailing the "devastating trauma and abuse inflicted on children held by Australia in offshore detention", including assaults, sexual abuse and self-harm attempts. In April 2017, there was a shooting when supposedly drunken PNG soldiers shot at refugees held at the centre. Nine people were wounded in the shooting that allegedly started after a conflict between detainees and guards got out of hand. In June 2017, the Australian government also agreed to pay 70 million Australian dollars ($53m) to more than 1,900 asylum seekers who sued over their treatment at the Manus camp. The men filed legal claims against the Australian government and two contractors who ran the camp between early 2012 and late 2014 over alleged physical and psychological injury they said they suffered, as well as for false imprisonment. One of these contractors, Broadspectrum, is still in charge of the Manus and Nauru detention centres.

They are not allowed to leave the camp to move around the island freely. Instead, they can only leave the camp on planned day trips. Ultimately, the goal of the 2012 deal is to resettle those who are granted asylum in PNG. However, many of those held have refused to leave the camp and go to temporary transit centres out of fear the local population will attack them. In a recent statement, the refugees said they are not planning to leave the Manus centre even after it closes. The UN has warned of a "humanitarian crisis" amid fears Australia would walk away completely from any involvement with refugees on the tiny Pacific Island . Why is Manus camp being closed? In April 2016, the PNG's Supreme Court ruled that the detention of refugees on Manus was illegal and in breach of fundamental human rights . Some five months later, the governments of PNG and Australia presented plans for the closure of the camp, without offering an exact timeframe. Earlier this year, parts of the camp were shut down in preparation for its final closure. Several compounds were demolished in advance of the planned shutting down, and refugees were told they had to prepare to be relocated in the PNG community, after transiting through the East Lorengau centre in PNG. {articleGUID} However, this would cover only those who were granted asylum, while no refugees would be resettled in Australia at any time. Australia has said it will fund the operation of three new transit centres on Manus for detainees. What will happen to the people living there? After the camp's closure, the fate of the 600 people living there will depend on the status of their individual claim to asylum. If a refugee's claim is seen as valid, he will first be moved from Manus island to a transit camp near the town of Lorengau, where they allegedly would be prepared to move into the PNG community. However, many refugees living in the camp have expressed fear for their safety if they have to move to Lorengau. There have been several incidents during which refugees who were granted asylum were injured or mistreated in other ways by the local PNG population, according to human rights organisations. As a result, so most of them moved back to the Manus detention centre because they could not integrate in the PNG community. For refugees whose claims are not seen as valid, the future appears even bleaker. If it is not safe for them to be repatriated, they will be resettled to a different country than Australia and PNG, or be held in detention indefinitely in one of the offshore camps where they often have already spent years of their lives. One of the countries involved in the resettling of the refugees is the US , which struck a deal with Australia during the Obama administration to house an unspecified number refugees out of the 1,600 held in Australian offshore detention centres on the islands of Nauru and PNG. {articleGUID} However, the election of Donald Trump cast doubt over the agreement's future after the US president called it "the worst deal ever". Despite the criticism, the US has started resettling refugees from Manus. So far, only 54 refugees have departed for the US. As of now, it is unclear what the reaction of the PNG government will be if the people living in the Manus detention centre refuse to move to different locations after the camp's closure, Since the people living in the centre will have no access to food, water or electricity and they refuse to leave, there is a risk the standoff will escalate into violence.

Flowers lie as part of a memorial to slain Honduran activist Berta Caceres, who was gunned down in her home on March 2, 2016 [Kavitha Chekuru/Al Jazeera] Honduran authorities have evidence implicating high-level business executives and state agents in the murder of prominent human rights activist Berta Caceres, but have yet to arrest them, a damning new report by a team of international lawyers says. The report, released on Tuesday morning, also says there have been serious flaws in the government's investigation into the March 2016 murder of Caceres and, despite orders from a judge, officials have not turned over the remaining evidence to the independent team. Caceres, one of the most well-known activists in Latin America and a winner of the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize, was gunned down in her home just before midnight on March 2, 2016, after years of threats related to her work protecting indigenous communities and campaigning against a hydroelectric dam project. The independent team behind Tuesday's report is comprised of five lawyers from Colombia , Guatemala and the United States and was organised at the request of Caceres' family last year due to concerns over the official investigation. The family, along with human rights activists and UN officials, repeatedly called on the government of Honduras last year to allow for an independent inquiry, but the government refused. To date, eight men have been arrested in connection with the murder, including an active-duty member of the Honduran military and two employees of the company behind the dam project, Desarrollos Energeticos (DESA). DESA had not responded to emails seeking comment from Al Jazeera at the time of publication, but has, in the past, denied any involvement in the murder of Caceres. {articleGUID} When the Al Jazeera's Fault Lines interviewed a spokesman for the Attorney General's office last year during an investigation into the murder of Caceres, he acknowledged that the men arrested were not the ones who planned the assassination or gave the ultimate order to carry it out. Despite this, the Honduran government has yet to arrest anyone else in the 20 months since Caceres was killed. Long-calculated plan The independent group's report says that evidence points to not only a large network that extends to executives in DESA, as well as state officials, but to a long-calculated plan shrouded in corruption. The report says that the group "has been able to establish the participation of executives, managers and employees of DESA, of private security personnel hired by the company, of state agents and parallel structures to state security forces in crimes committed before, during and after March 2, 2016, the day of the assassination". Roxanna Altholz, a US lawyer who was part of the independent group, told Al Jazeera that one of the most troubling revelations from the group's investigation is that the government has the same data the lawyers based their conclusions on, in addition to even more evidence. Altholz said that the public ministry "had information about the about the identity and actions and conduct of the intellectual authors for a year and a half and has failed to act".

The lawyers made several visits to Honduras to conduct dozens of interviews and had access to nearly 40,000 pages of evidence from the government's investigation, including text messages, WhatsApp messages and group chats and other telephone and cellular data. WhatsApp messages The report includes a number of WhatsApp messages from Sergio Rodriguez, one of the eight men arrested, and who was a social and environmental manager for DESA. Among the messages from Rodriguez were those from the day after the murder, including one where he forwards a copy of the police report of the crime scene that he received just hours after the killing to an undisclosed DESA executive. At this time, the report says, Caceres's family had not yet received that information from police. The executive later replies, telling him to "relax" and that "everything will turn out fine, you'll see. Don't panic and pass it on to others." {articleGUID} WhatsApp messages documented in the report also show frequent surveillance of Caceres and colleagues from the indigenous rights groups she led, COPINH, something they repeatedly made known to Caceres, according to her daughter. "They would send her pictures of a place she had been to saying 'I saw you here,'" Laura Zuniga Caceres told Fault Lines last year. "That was their control mechanism, their way of saying 'we are watching you,'" Victor Fernandez, Berta Caceres's lawyer, told Fault Lines at the time. 'No one is safe' Honduras continues to have one of the world's highest rates of murders against land rights and environmental activists, particularly since a military coup in 2009. {articleGUID} Many of the projects tied to the murder of land rights activists in Honduras, including the Agua Zarca dam project, involve some of the country's wealthiest and most powerful families. Despite millions of dollars in aid from the United States and support for investigative agencies, including the unit responsible for investigating the murder of Caceres, entrenched impunity has long stifled any meaningful investigations in Honduras. Caceres received numerous death threats in the years leading up to her murder. But in the initial days after the killing, officials first focused their investigation on members of COPINH, as well as a former boyfriend. Fellow activists made and placed a mosaic in the halls of COPINH, the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras [Kavitha Chekuru/Al Jazeera] In one of the WhatsApp messages listed in the report, a public relations executive with DESA tells Sergio Rodriguez to raise the question of why "COPINH wants to maintain its role as a victim". The PR official, according to the report, goes on to suggest that Rodriguez should, "in passing continue to press the possible motive of passion in the murder of Ms. Berta Caceres". Gustavo Castro, the only witness to the murder, told Al Jazeera's Fault Lines last year that when he met with authorities after the murder, they didn't seem to be interested in what he had to tell them. "When they requested that I do a police sketch, the sketch artist was drawing a member of COPINH," Castro recounted. "I said, 'That's not what he looks like! He looks different!' He erased it, and then he drew it again." The independent group's report is based only a fraction of the evidence available, and even then, the team of lawyers says they were able to point to larger levels of responsibility for Caceres' murder and new lines of investigation – something the Honduran government has yet to do. While the lawyers were able to say others were involved, they did not specifically name anyone besides the eight that have been arrested because authorities have not charged anyone else. But the group is still awaiting the larger remaining portion of evidence in the possession of the Honduran government. {articleGUID} "The public ministry has seized in raids dozens and dozens of computers, telephone chips, SIM cards, iPads, all kinds of electronic apparatus," Altholz said. "We are very concerned about what's going to happen with that evidence," she added. "What we found is an investigation that falls well short of international standards and seems to be driving towards impunity." Given Berta Caceres' international profile, the fact that the intellectual authors of her murder have not been arrested so long after the crime seems to be proof of the deep roots and staying power of Honduras' impunity. When Al Jazeera visited Honduras last year, Caceres' daughter, Laura, surrounded by photos of her mother, stated the most glaring truth that has emerged since her mother was killed: "After my mom's assassination, they showed that nobody is safe here."

When heavily armed police donning riot gear moved in on protesters on September 17, St Louis police officers broke up the march and taunted its participants. "Whose streets? Our streets," St Louis Police Department (SLMPD) officers sang out, co-opting a common rallying cry among demonstrators. Clinton Stancil, a St Louis-based reverend who has been involved in mobilising protests in the wake of an acquittal of a white police officer who killed an African American man in 2011, remembers the violence clearly. When police blocked peaceful marchers from crossing the street by allowing traffic to proceed, a local clergywoman went back to inform the officers that more demonstrators were en route to cross the intersection. The officers grabbed the woman, prompting Reverend Darryl Gray to come to her rescue. "They threw him to the ground, stepped and broke his glasses, and that was the spark that set off the whole thing," Stancil, 65, who has lived in the city for four years, tells Al Jazeera. {articleGUID} As demonstrators moved to intervene, Stancil recalls the officers then "indiscriminately" attacking them with chemical agents, such as pepper spray, and wantonly beating people with batons. They subsequently kettled march participants and bystanders before detaining them. "They arrested everyone who was on the street, and that's what caused many of the problems," he says, explaining that bystanders, journalists and others were among those rounded up. That was the third night of ongoing protests, which were sparked by the September 15 not-guilty verdict for Jason Stockley, a former policeman who shot dead 24-year-old Anthony Lamar Smith in December 2011. 'We will kill your pockets' The protesters have focused on causing economic disruption through boycotts and mass demonstrations, says Stancil, who posits the strategy as an alternative to destruction and rioting, with the hopes of prompting action within the corridors of power. Community members are demanding more civilian oversight over police, a demilitarisation of policing in their communities and accountability for officers who carry out violent acts. During the first 18 days of demonstrations after Stockley was acquitted police arrested at least 307 people [Lawrence Bryant/Reuters] On Saturday, protesters marked seven weeks of unrest when they showed up to demonstrate at a St Louis Halloween party in the city's Central West End area. On Tuesday, dozens of community members rallied outside the Mayor Lyda Krewson's home for at least the third protest outside the city leader's house. And on Thursday, faith leaders issued a call for an economic boycott of local stores in the city. {articleGUID} "We are going to continue even through the holidays… making sure we're at malls and asking our people not to spend money," Stancil explains. "If you kill our kids, we will kill your pockets." He adds: "It's a large economic hardship for the city, but that seems to be the only language they understand. If that's the only language they understand, then that's the language we'll speak." As the protest movement grows and police respond with mass arrests, St Louis, which is in the state of Missouri, has become the epicentre of the African American struggle for civil rights and equity. "St Louis is the new Selma," argues Stancil, referring to the Alabama town that became a crucial hub for the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Crackdown The forceful police response has elicited widespread criticism from human rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Missouri. The civil rights group has filed a class-action lawsuit against the SLMPD on behalf of several protesters, and many others have employed private attorneys to file civil suits against the department, according to the local River Front Times daily paper. "I think everyone deserves the same rights as I do. I just want peace and justice," said Maleeha Ahmad, a plaintiff in the ACLU of Missouri suit. Ahmad alleges police officers pepper sprayed her without warning during a rally on September 15. {articleGUID} "If it hadn't been for my fellow peaceful protesters - strangers who came to my aid - I don't know how my eyesight would be today. I would have been left out in the sun, on the ground, with my face burning." During the first 18 days of demonstrations after Stockley walked free, police arrested at least 307 people during protests, spokeswoman Schron Jackson told Al Jazeera. Jackson declined to address allegations of indiscriminate force and arrests, explaining that the police department cannot comment on pending claims and litigation. Following reports that police had arrested undercover officers in its sweep during the September 17 protest, Mayor Krewson called for an investigation, calling the allegations "disturbing", according to the St Louis Dispatch. She later said in a statement that "all complaints of misconduct [by police] that have been made are being reviewed by the police department's internal affairs division." The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) says at least 10 reporters have been among those arrested throughout the unrest.

In 2014, protests erupted after an officer killed Michael Brown , an unarmed African American teenager, in the northern St Louis suburb of Ferguson. Despite widespread anger, the officer was never charged with a crime. Green light for police brutality Earlier this year, right-wing US President Donald Trump ostensibly urged police officers to engage in brutality against suspects and arrestees. Speaking to an audience of police officers, Trump encouraged hitting suspects' heads on the door of police cars while putting them in the backseat. "When you see these towns and when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in, rough, and I said, 'Please don't be too nice,'" Trump declared. "Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over, like, don't hit their head and they've just killed somebody, don't hit their head, I said, 'You can take the hand away, okay?'" The officers responded with applause and cheers. "For years and years, [laws have] been made to protect the criminal," Trump continued. "Totally protect the criminal, not the officers. You do something wrong, you're in more jeopardy than they are. These laws are stacked against you. We're changing those laws." Faith and civic leaders have vowed to continue their protests in St Louis [Jeff Roberson/AP Photos] Jose Woss, a legislative manager at the Friends Committee on National Legislation, described Trump's comments as a green light for police brutality against the backdrop of increasing militarisation of police forces. "It is tough to sound hyperbolic these days, but this is part and parcel to the conversations we have around white supremacy," Woss tells Al Jazeera. "We seem to still see - at least in large swaths of society - anyone who has committed a mistake as deserving violence, and Trump's comments are indicative of that." In August, Trump rolled back restrictions on the transfer of military-grade weapons to US police departments. First implemented by the previous administration of President Barack Obama , those restrictions came in response to unrest over the killing of Michael Brown in 2014 in Ferguson. {articleGUID} Less than three years after the country was gripped by images of heavily-armed police storming neighbourhoods in the St Louis suburb, Trump lifted the Obama-era restrictions on sending certain types of surplus military equipment to police departments. While the transfer of military equipment to US police has historically enjoyed the support of Democrats and Republicans alike, Woss explains that the Trump administration has "boosted it into overdrive". "This is really a bipartisan issue," he says. "We except violence as typical of American society, whether it's militarisation abroad or militarisation of our police at home … because it's not in white people's backyards." 'Killing our kids' Back in St Louis, however, civil society groups and demonstrators plan to continue fighting police brutality. With policing practices changing little on the ground, communities of colour in the city feel ample cause for anger persists. On September 23, Karla Frye, a 56-year-old ordained minister and head of the Community Women Against Hardship charity, was one of 22 people arrested at the St Louis Galleria shopping mall, according to local media reports. {articleGUID} Frye was charged with felony assault on a law enforcement officer for attempting to intervene when officers arrested her 13-year-old grandson. Photos of officers treating the pair roughly and choking Frye subsequently went viral on social media and sparked widespread anger. For his part, Reverend Stancil hopes that protests continue until systematic racism is dismantled in communities of colour in St Louis and beyond. "Too many of us, as African Americans, are afraid that our children are not going to come home at night if they have any encounters with the police," Stancil says. "In America, we should not live that fear that our children are not going to come home just because they have an encounter with the police," he adds. "We are hoping that St Louis will bring attention to the rest of the nation, so we can sit down and have some dialogue about policing in America and the effects that policing has on a community."

Israeli Border Police and army soldiers block Palestinian protesters in the West Bank [Abed Al Hashlamoun/EPA] Wisconsin has become the latest US state to target the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions ( BDS ) movement, amid an ostensible crackdown on the activism. State Governor Scott Walker signed an executive order on Friday night that prohibits state agencies from contracting a business that is "engaging in a boycott of Israel". "We stand firmly against discrimination in any form and we wholly support our friends in Israel," Walker said in a statement after signing the order. The Wisconsin governor also expressed his support for a bill, introduced earlier this month by a pair of Republican legislator, State Senator Leah Vukmir and State Representative Dale Kooyenga, that would forbid companies that engage in boycotts of Israel from obtaining state contracts. "Boycotts of Israel must be fought because they do not just attack the Jewish state. This propaganda campaign is also the basis for newly emboldened and destructive anti-Semitic attitudes," Vukmir said in a press release. "We must support our ally, Israel." Although the bill is still being considered, it follows a string of similar legal measures imposed by at least 22 other states across the country. Rights groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), have blasted these measures as unconstitutional and repressive. On Monday, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan signed an executive order that similarly bans firms that boycott Israel from state contracts. Last week, the city of Dickinson, situated in Texas, sparked widespread condemnation from rights groups when it conditioned hurricane relief aid on promises that the recipient is not engaging in, and will not participate in, a boycott of Israel. The city later voted to remove the Israel language from the application for private citizens, but will still require companies it contracts to state they do not boycott Israel, local media reported. {articleGUID} Omar Barghouti, cofounder of the BDS movement and a founding committee member of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel, said crackdowns on boycott advocates are a kneejerk reaction to the movement's growing success. "After losing so many battles for hearts and minds against the fast-growing BDS movement for Palestinian rights," he told Al Jazeera, "Israel and its massive lobby are desperately trying to stop the movement from above, by passing draconian, unconstitutional laws that evoke the worst memories of McCarthyism." Barghouti cited a growing number of churches, unions and university campuses divesting from Israeli banks and international companies that operate in Israel and its Jewish-only settlements throughout the occupied Palestinian territory. Global 'warfare' Started in 2005, BDS is a global campaign that draws from the anti-Apartheid struggle in South Africa and calls for grassroots pressure to hold Israel accountable for violations of international law and human rights . Enjoying broad support from Palestinian civil society, the movement urges boycotting, divesting from and sanctioning Israel until it ends its decades-long occupation of Arab land, provides Palestinian citizens of Israel with full equality and allows Palestinian refugees to return to their homes. In response, Israel and its advocates have pushed measures that target BDS activists at home and abroad, including espionage and a tactic it calls "legal warfare". Earlier this year, Israel imposed an entry ban on BDS supporters. In July, that ban was put into action when five American activists were blocked from boarding a Tel Aviv-bound plane owing to their political views. {articleGUID} In 2016, Israel allotted $26m to fighting BDS by gathering intelligence on activists online. The Israel Group, a US-based organisation that opposes BDS, has been a leading participant in efforts to marginalise the boycott movement. The group has lobbied school districts, universities and other institutions that host panels discussions and other events promoting BDS. Jack Saltzberg, founder and executive director of The Israel Group, dismissed claims that anti-BDS legislation violates free speech, arguing that many of the laws have "virtually no teeth" and do not prevent individual expressions of support for the boycott. Nonetheless, Saltzberg believes that anti-BDS legislation can be "harmful to the pro-Israel cause". "It creates a false sense of security," he told Al Jazeera, "and, as nice as city, state, and federal anti-BDS legislation is, the pro-Israel community is badly losing the BDS war, and [that] will not change until we alter our decades-old strategies and paradigm." Support for BDS, including sanctions, will only rise as a result. Omar Barghouti, cofounder of the BDS movement. The Israel Group has recently criticised California public school districts for hosting Palestine-focused educational seminars, including in Orange County and Los Angeles County. In March, the federal Israel Anti-Boycott Act - a bill that seeks to criminalise boycotting Israel - was introduced in the US Congress. The US also threatened to cut funding to the United Nations in August over its plans to publish a list compiling all the companies complicit in Israel's settlement enterprise. For his part, Barghouti argued that the crackdown on BDS is bound to backfire. "Israel's policies of ethnic cleansing of Palestinian communities, incessant construction of illegal settlements, home demolitions and siege of Gaza, coupled with Israel's association of late with the xenophobic far-right in the US and elsewhere, is shredding to pieces its fake mask of democracy," he said. "Support for BDS, including sanctions, will only rise as a result." SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Human Rights United States Palestine Israel Politics
Signatures of Palestinian school students were presented to the British consulate in East Jerusalem [Reuters] People in various parts of the world have staged protests on the centenary of Britain's Balfour Declaration , which promised a homeland for the Jewish people and paved the way for the occupation of Palestine . Thousands gathered in Ramallah, administrative capital of the occupied Palestinian territories, on Thursday to march to the British cultural centre, according to official Palestinian media. A statement from the office of President Mahmoud Abbas called for an apology from Britain, recognition of Palestine and compensation for the Palestinian people in political, moral and material terms.

Dozens of others gathered in a separate protest outside the British consulate in occupied East Jerusalem . A hundred thousand signatures and hundreds of letters from Palestinian high school students were presented to the British consulate in occupied East Jerusalem, according to Sawsan Safadi, an official from the Palestinian Ministry of Education. The letters expressed the students' feelings about the legacy of the declaration. {articleGUID} Khadija Khalaf, a 17-year-old Palestinian high school student from East Jerusalem, was among the protesters who carried the letters. "We came here holding signatures of 100,000 students from the schools of Palestine protesting against the Balfour promise," Khalaf told Al Jazeera. "After 100 years, we the Palestinians have not taken our rights. We hope that they hear our voices as children." Protesters shouted slogans such as "Down with the Brits" and "Justice, power, freedom: Our state is Palestinian". "In addition to admitting its mistake, it must assume responsibility for the damage that befell the Palestinians as a result of the Balfour Declaration and the policies that ensued," Zakaria Odeh, a 64-year-old protester, told Al Jazeera. Hundreds of people gathered outside the Israeli embassy in Pretoria [Azad Essa/Al Jazeera] Protest in Pretoria In Pretoria, South Africa , hundreds gathered outside the Israeli embassy in a protest against the Israeli occupation of Palestine, organised by the Economic Freedom Fighters party (EFF). Protesters, dressed in the characteristic red T-shirts of the EFF, held placards with slogans calling for an end to "Israeli ethnic cleansing of Palestinians" and a halt to attacks on the Gaza Strip , as they danced and sang outside the heavily guarded embassy. "Away with apartheid Israel, away," the crowd shouted. Julius Malema, leader of the EFF, urged the crowd to look beyond their own context and to consider the plight of the Palestinians. {articleGUID} He also called for a one-state solution where Jews and Palestinians could live in peace. Malema made an impassioned appeal to South Africans to stop working with Israel , even asking South Africans to stop travelling to the country in solidarity with Palestine. "We asking all South Africans to stop doing business with Israel, to stop visiting Israel. We are returning the favour to the people of Palestine who stood with us," Malema said to loud cheers. "We call for the release of Marwan Barghouti, who is in sitting in Israeli jail, in quite the same way that Nelson Mandela was in jail for all those years," Zaakirah Vadi, communications officer for the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, an anti-apartheid organisation, told the crowd. Roads around the embassy were closed off, and police had closed the entrance to the building. {articleGUID} Many South Africans see the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and the policies applied there as similar to apartheid, the institutionalised racial segregation and discrimination implemented by the white minority in their country until 1991.

Sao Bernando do Campo, Sao Paulo - As the sky cleared after a morning of rain, two young men hammered wooden beams into wet earth on a stretch of land, covered by thousands of tents made from plastic sheeting and timber. It is here where squatters have built a teeming tent city, named the People without Fear Occupation, in the industrial city of Sao Bernardo do Campo, next to Sao Paulo. The occupation sits on a fenced-off 70 square-kilometre lot - roughly the size of eight soccer pitches - and is overlooked by middle class condominium blocks. The squatters say they are driven by expensive rents and Brazil's current economic crisis. Unemployment is the highest in decades at 12.4 percent. More than 13 million are unemployed. Almost all of those living here survive precariously day to day from odd jobs. Many have racked up debts. They are occupying the land to pressure the government to build more low-income housing. Hundreds of similar occupations have sprung up in recent years, on the edges of Sao Paulo, South America's wealthiest city, and across Brazil. "I used to reject jobs if the money or the conditions weren't right. Now I'll take anything," Helio da Conceicao dos Santos, a 25-year-old professional bricklayer, told Al Jazeera. Adelino de Lima Silva, a 34-year-old construction worker unemployed since 2015, said that sometimes only manages two or three odd jobs a month. {articleGUID} "Jobs which used to pay BRL$150 [$47] now pay BRL$100 [$31] or BRL$80 [$25] it's really competitive. We used to live well employed full time, now it's barely enough to eat," he added. Douglas Souza Ferreira, a 27-year-old father of one, lost his job at a soft drinks factory three years ago. "You chase after jobs, spending your own money. Then when things don't work out, you come home upset because you can't provide for your family," he said. More than 7,500 families lived int he occupation by early October [Tommaso Protti/Al Jazeera] Organisers say on the first day of the occupation in early September, 500 families occupied the empty land. But within a week, that number grew to 5,000 families, and by early October more than 7,500 families were set up there. "This shows the worsening social crisis in Brazil and the deepening housing deficit," Guilherme Boulos, national coordinator for the Homeless Workers Movement (MTST) that organised the occupation and commands dozens of others across Sao Paulo state and more nationwide, told Al Jazeera. 'The perfect storm' Brazil's housing deficit stood at 6.2 million homes according to a study by Joao Pinheiro Foundation using the last available data from 2015. Sao Paulo state, Brazil's most populous, was the most affected, with a total deficit of 1.3 million homes. Even in Sao Paulo's far-flung neighbourhoods, which lack infrastructure, are often crime ridden and can require two hour commutes downtown, apartment rentals usually cost between $150 and $240. Minimum wage is about $285 a month. Boulos said the housing deficit worsened since 2015 as Brazil plunged deeper into recession, the result of falling commodity prices, economic mismanagement and political crisis. The economy contracted 3.8 percent in 2016. In 2016, 37,000 housing units for low-income families were built [Tommaso Protti/Al Jazeera] The Sao Paulo ABC region where the occupation is located was once the country's booming industrial hub. It has lost 80,000 jobs since 2015 according to data by the Brazil Institute of Geography and Statistics. "The majority of workers on the urban peripheries don't own their house; they rent and are totally vulnerable - if family members lose their jobs and income falls drastically, they lose their home," Boulos said. "This is the drama being lived by millions of families across Brazil today and is causing occupations to increase across the country." He added that cuts to the federal social housing programme "Minha Casa, Minha Vida" have exacerbated the crisis. "It's a perfect storm - increased demand and reduced supply of low-income housing," Boulos said. Data given to Al Jazeera by Brazil's Ministry of Cities confirmed that the number of low-income housing units built to attend families with a monthly income is less than $550 dropped from 537,000 units in 2013 to just 17,000 units in 2015 and 37,000 units in 2016. The Sao Bernardo occupation has community kitchens, bathrooms and meeting rooms where tasks are allocated such as cleaning and cooking. Many spend their time divided between the camp and friends or relatives houses. 'We're not looking for handouts' Heloha dos Santos Silva,17, and her husband Marlon, 19, live at the occupation full time with their nine-month-old daughter Helena. Marlon does odd jobs working at a car wash, but rarely gets work. "It's a squeeze and sometimes water gets inside when it rains. What we dream of is our own home," said Heloha. Organisers say they want the land disappropriated and used to build low-income housing. This is legal in Brazil if the property has remained vacant and unproductive for some time. In 2014 ahead of Brazil's football world cup, squatters won the right to remain and build low-income housing on an abandoned lot in Sao Paulo's East Zone, an occupation dubbed "Cup of the People". Brazil occupation [Tommaso Protti/Al Jazeera] "We're not looking for handouts, we want what we have the right to in the constitution: housing, decent healthcare, education," said Andreia Barbosa, a single mother of five and one of the camp coordinators. Organisers and local media say the Sao Bernardo lot belongs to construction company MZM Construtora and has been vacant for 40 years. They also allege the company owes hundreds of thousands of Brazilian real in back taxes to the local government. Al Jazeera contacted MZM Construtora for comment but received no response by the time of publication. Eviction ordered Local government and a neighbourhood petition group say the occupation affronts property rights. "It's ridiculous, you can't just invade someone else's property, the land has an owner," said Eneas Moreira, 54, a consultant for the automotive industry whose apartment overlooks the camp. He said he feared that the occupation would bring down the value of his apartment. "It's terrible to see each day, the conditions are appalling, there is no infrastructure there," he said. {articleGUID} Moreira and about 2,000 others recently took part in a street protest against the occupation. Brazilian media reported that one of the squatters was shot with an air-gun on the day of the protest. Sao Bernardo City Hall said in an official comment to Al Jazeera: "The administration is against any form of invasion, be it public or private land." It added that it has its own housing programme with "1,980 people on the waiting list". The eviction of the occupation has been ordered by a local judge. The squatters, the judiciary, the owner of the land and local security chiefs are expected to meet on December 11 to negotiate the eviction. Sao Bernardo Mayor Orlando Morando posted a video on his Facebook, welcoming the eviction but said he hoped it would be peaceful. Evictions from similar occupations have been rough in the past. In 2012, an eviction of a similar housing occupation Pinheirinho on the outskirts of Sao Jose dos Campos in Sao Paulo state ended in a pitched battle between military police and occupiers that lasted two days with scores injured. On October 31, 10,000 housing movement activists marched 20km from the Sao Bernardo occupation to Sao Paulo's governor's palace to demand the disappropriation of the land. Local media reported that authorities will meet with the squatters again next week to review their demands. "Our rights won't fall out of the sky, that's why it's important that we continue to mobilise," said Boulos.

Ninety-three-year-old Mugabe has been ruling Zimbabwe since its independence from Britain in 1980 [Reuters] Zimbabwean police have arrested a US citizen for allegedly "insulting" President Robert Mugabe in a tweet she shared, her lawyers say, in the first apparent arrest since the country's creation of the Ministry of Cyber Security. Martha O'Donovan, who works for Magamba TV, was arrested on Friday during a dawn raid on her home in Harare, the television station said in a statement . She had re-tweeted a post which apparently referred to Mugabe as a "selfish man and sick man", Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR), which is representing O'Donovan, said in a tweet on Friday. Zimbabwe Republic Police "says Martha O'Donovan insulted Mugabe when she allegedly tweeted that 'We are being led by a selfish man and sick man'", ZLHR tweeted. The post shared by O'Donovan did not refer to Mugabe by name. ZLHR also said on Twitter that O'Donovan is being charged with "undermining [the] authority of or insulting [the] president". #FreeMartha #ZRP says @Martha_ODonovan insulted #Mugabe when she allegedly tweeted that "We are being led by a selfish man and sick man." — ZLHR (@ZLHRLawyers) November 3, 2017 'Fishing expedition' Doug Coltart, a human rights lawyer in Harare, capital of Zimbabwe , said that if convicted, O'Donovan could face more than 20 years in prison. "O'Donovan is charged with insulting the president, which is punishable with a sentence of a year," he told Al Jazeera. "More significantly, she is charged with subverting a constitutional government, which carries a hefty sentence of 20 years in prison. It is almost equal to treason," Coltart said. "This is directly related to her role with Magamba TV, and a subsidiary of Magamba called Open Parly, which talks all about the work of parliament. {articleGUID} "This is what we expected all along, that it was not really about the retweet. It was really a fishing expedition to get information about her work at Magamba TV, and try and go after the organisation itself." 'New battleground is social media' This is the first arrest since the creation of the Ministry of Cyber Security in Zimbabwe last month. The new ministry focuses on crimes on social media and the worldwide web in general, in advance of the 2018 presidential election. Amnesty International condemned the arrest , saying it "marks the start of a sinister new chapter in the Zimbabwean government's clampdown on freedom of speech - and the new battleground is social media". The human rights organisation added that the charges "confirm fears that this new portfolio [ministry] will simply be used to punish anyone speaking out against the authorities on social media platforms". Zimbabwean officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mugabe has been ruling Zimbabwe since its independence from Britain in 1980. He says he seeks to run for another five-year term in next year's elections. SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Human Rights Zimbabwe Africa Robert Mugabe
Security forces killed at least 28 people in rare protests in the Eritrean capital, an opposition group has claimed, raising concerns from human rights groups and activists. The violence witnessed in demonstrations in Asmara on Tuesday also prompted a safety warning from the US embassy in Eritrea , which confirmed receiving reports of gunfire and advised people to stay away from areas where protests were taking place. The opposition Red Sea Afar Democratic Organization wrote on its Facebook page on Wednesday: "This uprising has left 28 martyrs and 100 wounded … we call on the international community and human rights organisations to bring those involved to justice." Activists told Al Jazeera that the protests began on Tuesday after the government ordered an Islamic school to ban the headscarf and halt religious education. The violence centred on the predominantly-Muslim neighbourhood of Akriya, where the Diaa Islamic School of Asmara of 3,000 students is located. Displays of public protests are rare in Eritrea, a country often criticised for human rights abuses. President Isaias Afwerki has been in power since 1993. Hundreds of students reportedly joined the protests, and the crowds continued to grow later. The US embassy has not confirmed the deaths. 'Black hawk dawn moment' "The government attempted to confiscate Al Diaa Islamic School, an institution established in the late 1960s," Meron Estefanos, an activist based in Sweden, told Al Jazeera. "The current unrest was triggered by the government's arrest of Haj Mussa who was the honourary president of the Al Diaa school." She claimed that security forces beat students, who retaliated by throwing stones. {articleGUID} "Soon, the rallies spread to the streets of central Asmara where the security forces used brute force to quell the protests," she said. "This moment is the true meaning of a bottled up feelings and years' worth of oppression that is now surfacing. I believe the people of Eritrea have tolerated so many things for so long and now it is time to express and stand up for their rights." But Yemane G Meskel, Eritrea's minister of information, dismissed the reports of casualties. "Small demonstration by one school in Asmara dispersed without [casualties] hardly breaking news," he tweeted. Eritrea, which borders Ethiopia , Sudan and Djibouti, often features towards the very end of indices on freedom of expression, close to countries such as North Korea . "I think it's a draconian measure, yet again in controlling the Eritrean public and squeezing out any public space and any freedom of expression," Selam Kidane, a London-based activist, told Al Jazeera. "Asmara is a peaceful city, but this has been described as a black hawk dawn moment - nursery school children were being chased through the streets." She said that young people have "taken matters into their own hands" because Eritrea is a "country ruled by fear". "People are taking enormous risk and it's a courageous step to take," Kidane said. 'Bound to happen' In June this year, Sheila B Keetharuth, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea, said citizens suffer arbitrary arrest, incommunicado detention, enforced disappearances, and a national service system that amounts to enslavement. Tuesday's protests have "opened a big door", Saleh Gadi Johar, a California-based author and activist, told Al Jazeera. {articleGUID} "They [people] snapped. Even if it's quelled for a time, it will rise again. I expect others are inspired. All denominations of Eritreans - particularly the young -have joined." Johar, who also edits awate.com , a dissident website, said he believes the Eritrean government would arrest anybody it didn't like. The warning from the US embassy, he said, was not a sign of a major political development. "I don't expect anything from US and West when Eritreans are suffering. It's politics as usual. "Being an Eritrean, I don't wish any bloodshed of violence for my country - people have gone through a lot. I wish for a peaceful transition to calm. But if that doesn't come, then such appeal should be expected. It's sad its happened, but it was bound to happen."

About 50,000 people a year are awarded US green cards through the Diversity Visa Program [Joe Penney/Reuters] Rights groups and legal experts have slammed US President Donald Trump 's call to end the Diversity Visa Program after Tuesday's attack in New York City, saying his remarks are "rash" and a "vast overreaction". Trump called for the end of the programme, which awards green cards to about 50,000 people every year, after Uzbek national Sayfullo Saipov allegedly drove a rented truck down a crowded bike path in New York, killing eight people and injuring at least a dozen others. "The terrorist came into our country through what is called the 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program'", Trump tweeted on Wednesday, adding that he wants a "merit based" programme instead. A day later he said he was calling on Congress to "terminate" the programme, saying its "applicants are randomly selected in a random lottery and the people put in that lottery are not that country's finest." But immigration rights groups and legal experts say labelling the programme as a strict lottery is "misleading", and punishing millions for the actions of one individual is "insane". What is the Diversity Visa Programme? Congress created the Diversity Visa Program under the 1990 Immigration Reform Act to aid populations that were underrepresented among US immigrants, Antonio Meloni, executive director of Immigration Advocacy Services, told Al Jazeera. Aimed initially at increasing the immigration of Irish nationals, immigrants of European origin were the primary recipients of diversity visas. Gradually this has shifted to those of African origin, who receive, on average, 40 percent of available visas, according to a Congressional Research Service study in 2011. Only those from eligible countries - those that have sent less than 50,000 immigrants in the past five years - are able to apply. {articleGUID} In some years up to 16 million people have applied for the programme. About 100,000 applicants are selected from this pool, but only half will ultimately receive green cards, according to Meloni. He added that the process of applying is more complex than the first step - filing an online application - would suggest. "It's not as if you win the lottery and you come in," Meloni said. Individuals applying this year during the one-month application period from October 18 to November 22 must provide documentation showing they have completed 12 years of education or two years of work. This may not seem like much, Anu Joshi, director of immigration policy at the New York Immigration Coalition, said, "but for a lot of people in other parts of the world, it's not that easy to prove, to get all of the documents". "Winning" the lottery is no guarantee. Those selected must then apply during the second year for a visa and begin the same marathon of vetting procedures, including background checks and medical examinations all residency applicants undergo. Only 7 percent of recipients can come from any one state, further limiting the chances of those from countries with large applicant pools, according to Meloni. In regards to the risks to national security, Joshi told Al Jazeera that calling the diversity visa process a "lottery" is "misleading". {articleGUID} "Sure, diversity applicants throw their names into this pool, and if they get selected, that's the lottery part," Joshi said. "After that, everything is the same as anyone else who is trying to emigrate to the United States … They face all of the same barriers in terms of national security threats." It is typically not until the third year that candidates are interviewed by the US Department of State or consulates before their visas can be issued, Meloni added. Who applies for the Diversity Visa Program? Since its founding, well over one million immigrants have been admitted to the US through the diversity visa programme, Meloni said. Applicants from around the world, whether applying alone or with their families, do so with the same aim: To try to make a better life for themselves and their families, according to rights groups. The majority of residency visas are granted on the basis of family ties, Fred Tsao, senior policy counsel at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, told Al Jazeera. {articleGUID} As a result, the diversity visa is "a gated pathway to the United States that they might not otherwise have", Tsao said. Other legal pathways to US immigration are through employment, asylum or refugee resettlement, which are difficult to attain and time-intensive. The diversity visa lottery remains the most desirable prospect, particularly for immigrants from Africa or Asia, Tsao explained. A third of immigrants from Africa come to the US with a diversity visa, according to the US Department of State. While the programme may not take the form Trump imagines for a merit-based system, Amaha Kassa, founder and executive director of African Communities Together, told Al Jazeera that he believes the "stringent requirements" and challenge of navigating the process of the diversity visa process "select for higher-educated people". African immigrants, who enter the country through a variety of ways, have higher educational achievement than both the overall immigrant and overall US populations, according to a Pew study of census data from 2013. Diversity visa recipients also have less than half the unemployment rate of other green card holders, and more than twice as many are employed in professional or managerial positions, a 2011 Congressional Research Service report found. 'Won't stand by' President Trump's recent call to end the diversity visa lottery is not the first time the programme has been challenged since it was implemented. {articleGUID} The 2011 study by the Congressional Research Service addressed concerns that the programme was vulnerable to fraud and the difficulty of conducting background checks in some of the countries where applicants live. In 2013, a bill that would have terminated the programme passed in the US Senate, but was ultimately rejected in the House of Representatives. Earlier this year, Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas introduced the RAISE Act, which would save the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA, policy, but at the expense of the visa lottery programme. Cotton argued in August that cutting immigration in half and prioritising highly-skilled immigrants would "spur economic growth and raise working Americans' wages". Immigrant community organisations are not standing idly by, Kassa told Al Jazeera. "My organisation and other African community organisations, we would and we will oppose any bill - such as the RAISE Act - that would eliminate the diversity lottery," Kassa said. Trump, however, continues to advocate for redirecting immigration policy to focus on merit-based visas as a measure to improve domestic security. The response has led to heightened concerns among recipients of diversity visas, who feel villainised despite having followed procedure to enter the US legally, Kassa said. Immigration Advocacy Services' Meloni told Al Jazeera that the inclusion of a merit-based system would not be a detriment, but also would be no replacement for the diversification provided by the lottery programme. Whatever path immigration reform takes, Kassa told Al Jazeera, it should not be undertaken rashly or in reaction to an isolated tragedy. "We're now reacting to one out of those over a million people who were admitted through this programme. Our view is that we should be making policy based on the million, not based on the one," Kassa said. SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Immigration Donald Trump United States US & Canada Human Rights
Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda says ICC judges to decide whether an investigation is necessary [Getty Images] The International Criminal Court's ( ICC ) chief prosecutor has announced she will seek to start an official investigation into possible war crimes during the war in Afghanistan . "Following a meticulous preliminary examination of the situation, I have come to the conclusion that all legal criteria required under the Rome Statute to commence an investigation have been met," Fatou Bensouda said in a statement on Friday. The prosecutor did not name the specific parties she seeks to investigate. But in a report last year ( pdf ), ICC prosecutors said the Taliban and its affiliates, Afghan authorities and members of the US armed forces and CIA may have committed war crimes. {articleGUID} "In due course, I will file my request for judicial authorisation to open an investigation, submitting that there is a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed in connection with the armed conflict in Afghanistan," Bensouda said on Friday. She added it is up to the judges of the court in The Hague to decide whether the criteria to authorise an investigation are fulfilled. Bensouda said that if authorisation is given, her office will investigate "in an independent, impartial and objective way, crimes within the court's jurisdiction allegedly committed by any party to the armed conflict". 2016 report The report by Bensouda last year said that there was a "reasonable basis to believe" US armed forces and the CIA may have subjected more than 60 detainees to "torture". "Members of US armed forces appear to have subjected at least 61 detained persons to torture," the prosecutors' office said in that report, adding that CIA members also seemed to have tortured 27 detainees in secret detention facilities elsewhere, but not in Afghanistan. The report said that incidents appeared to have taken place in 2003 and 2004. PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The US state department at the time said the probe was not " warranted or appropriate ". The 2016 report also said there "is reasonable basis to believe that" crimes against humanity were committed by the Taliban and its affiliates. It said there was a basis to believe "war crimes of torture and related ill-treatment" were carried out by Afghan government forces. The US forces occupied parts of Afghanistan after the attacks on September 1, 2011, to track Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders who Washington blamed for the attack. The US forces ended their combat mission in 2014. Founded in 2003, the ICC seeks to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Rights groups have blasted right-wing US President Donald Trump's declaration that he may send the suspect of a deadly attack in Manhattan to the US-run Guantanamo Bay detention centre in Cuba . On Wednesday, Trump announced he was considering sending Sayfullo Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan who is suspected of killing eight people in Manhattan a day earlier, to Guantanamo Bay. New York Police Department Commissioner John Miller said at a press conference on Wednesday that Saipov carried out the attack "in the name of ISIS", referring to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) group. Within hours of the attack on Tuesday, Trump tweeted: " We must not allow ISIS to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere. Enough!" On Wednesday, the president also urged Congress to repeal the State Department's Diversity Visa Lottery Programme, which provides up to 50,000 visas a year, and replace it with a "merit-based" programme. 'Dangerous precedent' Ibrahim Hooper, the national communications director at the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), said sending the suspect to Guantanamo would "be on its face unconstitutional". "It would set a very dangerous precedent for treating Americans differently based on faith, ethnicity or national origin and could create a two-tiered legal system," he told Al Jazeera, arguing that Trump has demonstrated a double standard when responding to violent incidents allegedly carried out by Muslims. Speaking by telephone on Wednesday morning, Hooper alluded to a mass shooting that left 58 people dead in Las Vegas last month. In that attack, Stephen Paddock, a 54-year-old white man from the US, opened fire on a country music concert. The assailant also took his own life. In the wake of the attack, Trump urged caution in response to widespread calls for the government to tighten gun laws. A memo distributed by the White House said that "new laws won't stop a mad man". Hooper accused the president of "showing a difference in his approach to different incidents based on who the alleged perpetrators are" and displaying distrust in authorities' ability to execute their jobs. On Wednesday, Trump said that the US has to "come up with punishment that is far quicker and far greater than the punishment these animals are getting right now". He added: "We need quick justice and we need strong justice - much quicker and much stronger than we have right now. Because what we have right now is a joke and it's a laughing stock." {articleGUID} Hooper said that Trump's rhetoric "seems to indicate a lack of confidence in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, law enforcement and the judicial system, which he has declared as a whole to be a joke". The Guantanamo Bay detention camp was established by former President George W Bush in 2002 and held 684 detainees at its peak. Most prisoners are held at the facility without charge or trial. Only eight detainees have been convicted in military commissions after trail or following a plea deal, according to Human Rights Watch. Although Bush's successor, former President Barack Obama , signed an executive order to close the camp in 2009, the facility remains open. As of January 2017, there were at least 41 detainees held in Guantanamo. Trump has vowed to keep the detention camp open. During the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump said the US "was going to load it [Guantanamo Bay] up with some bad dudes". 'Neither legal nor effective' Wade McMullen, a lawyer at the Washington, DC-based Robert F Kennedy Human Rights Center, echoed Hooper's criticisms of the president's comments on Wednesday. "It's not even worth reacting to whether the president's suggestion of sending this suspect to [Guantanamo] is legal or even effective - it's clearly neither," he told Al Jazeera. McMullen pointed to Trump's response to a deadly attack at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, on August 12. {articleGUID} During that incident, James Alex Fields, who had been photographed marching with neo-Nazis earlier in the day, allegedly ploughed his car into an anti-racist march, killing 32-year-old activist Heather Heyer and injuring 19 others. Although Trump subsequently denounced the attack and disavowed a host of white supremacist organisations that participated in the rally, he insisted that "there were very fine people" among both the white supremacists and the counterdemonstrators. "What we should be asking is why is this president is quick to use such radical, extreme language in the wake of the tragedy in New York, but after the terror attack in Charlottesville, could only muster something about how 'there were very fine people on both sides'," McMullen said. "Racism and Islamophobia will never result in sound, legal or effective counterterrorism policy." The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), another rights organisation, also condemned Trump's rush to impose sweeping measures in the wake of the attack. "Sending Saipov to Guantanamo or treating him as an ‘enemy combatant’ would violate due process and the rule of law," Anthony D Romero, executor director of the ACLU, said in a statement on Wednesday. "It's a shame that Trump is using this attack as a platform for pushing his anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim agenda." SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Islamophobia Human Rights United States US & Canada
Nucera has been charged with a hate crime and other civil rights offences [File: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters] A police chief in the US state of New Jersey compared African Americans to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) armed group and expressed his desire to "mow 'em down" in a firing squad, according to a federal lawsuit. Sixty-year-old Frank Nucera Jr, who was the police chief of the Bordentown Township Police Department (BTPD) until earlier this year, has been charged with a federal hate crime and other civil rights offences. The charges were unsealed on Tuesday. The lawsuit, seen by Al Jazeera, alleges that Nucera slammed the head of an African American suspect, who is not named in the documents, "into a doorjamb, causing bodily injury". The lawsuit also describes a worrisome pattern of racist remarks, including referring to African Americans as "n*ggers", "n*gs" and "m*ulies". Nucera retired from the force in January under "mysterious" circumstances, The Trentonian, a local newspaper, reported at the time. Likening African Americans to ISIL (also known as ISIS), Nucera reportedly expressed his desire to subject them to a firing squad while speaking to a subordinate officer. "I wish that n*gger would come back from Trenton and give me a reason to put my hands on him, I'm tired of 'em," he said of an African American believed to have slashed the tires of a police vehicle in November 2015, according to the lawsuit. "These n*ggers are like ISIS; they have no value. They should line them all up and mow 'em down. I'd like to be on the firing squad; I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I'm tired of it." Using dogs for intimidation At the time of publication, Tracy Riley, Nucera's lawyer, had not replied to Al Jazeera's request for a comment. Nucera appeared in court on Wednesday and was released after making bail, which was set at $500,000, according to court transcripts. The lawsuit further accuses the former police chief of using police dogs to intimidate African Americans. In one instance, the lawsuit says, Nucera instructed officers to bring dogs to basketball games where the police department provided security to "intimidate African American patrons". {articleGUID} On April 30, 2016, Nucera allegedly ordered an officer to walk a canine through an apartment complex to "let these f*cking m*ulies see him". Later that year, on September 1, the former police chief responded to a call for backup at the Bordentown Ramada hotel, where two officers had been in an altercation with two teenage African American suspects alleged to have not paid for their accommodation. The lawsuit says that Nucera slammed an 18-year-old suspect's head into a doorjamb although he was "handcuffed and no longer resisting" arrest. An unnamed police officer cited in the lawsuit "did not report Nucera's use of force, even though he viewed it as excessive, because he was afraid of retaliation from the defendant". The teenager asked to be hospitalised initially, but he subsequently changed his mind and was taken to jail, the federal complaint says. 'Lack of accountability' The lawsuit comes at a time when civil rights groups and watchdogs are criticising right-wing US President Donald Trump for ostensibly urging police officers to engage in police brutality and excessive force. While addressing police officers in New York's Suffolk County in August, Trump told them not to be "too nice" while putting "thugs in the back of a paddy wagon". Trump went on to tell the officers to "take the hand away" rather than shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects while putting them in police vehicles. Jose Woss, legislative manager at the Friends Committee on National Legislation, explained that Trump's comments speak to a broad segment of society that believes it is permissible to behave violently to people suspected of crimes. "It's not to say that all cops are bad, but there are serious systemic problems in society, and that's also the case in policing," he told Al Jazeera by telephone, alluding to a complex web of factors that disproportionately impact African Americans in the country's justice system. {articleGUID} Although African Americans account for some 12 percent of the population, they make up roughly a quarter of those killed by police officers last year, according to The Counted, a database maintained by The Guardian. Mapping Police Violence, a watchdog group, says that 99 percent of police officers who used deadly force in 2015 were not convicted of a crime. That group has documented at least 964 people killed by police so far this year. "Policing hasn't changed much in America over the last century, with the exception of some protections in the Civil Rights era," Woss added. "It's really easy for the average American to not see this as a problem." He said: "The history of a lack of accountability bears this out. It's incredibly difficult to not only indict but convict someone who is guilty of essentially murder." {articleGUID} SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Racism Human Rights United States US & Canada
A woman holds a placard with a portrait of Sergei Magnitsky during a 2012 rally [Tatyana Makeyeva/Reuters] Canada's move to impose sanctions on 30 Russian officials was "senseless and reprehensible" and has led to retaliatory measures, Russian officials said. Canada announced the sanctions on Friday against Russian officials it accused of complicity in the death of anti-corruption lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in 2009 while he was in prison after alleging state tax fraud. Kirill Kalinin, a spokesman for the Russian diplomatic mission in Ottawa, told the official TASS news agency late on Friday retaliatory actions against Canadians had already been set in motion. "Canada's decision on extending anti-Russian sanctions under a false pretext of a hypocritical protection of human rights is absolutely senseless and reprehensible," said Kalinin. Ottawa's move "is isolating itself from one of the key global powers" and "pushes Canada's foreign policy back to the narrow black-and-white world view, incompatible with modern geopolitics", he added. "Dozens of Canadians" have now been barred from entering Russia in response, Kalinin said, without specifying who would be affected. Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova confirmed: "the list is long, with dozens of names on it". The foreign ministry said in a statement those targeted are "Russophobic Canadian citizens who have consistently worked to destroy bilateral relations." {articleGUID} In 2008, the whistle-blower Magnitsky accused Russian interior ministry officials of organising a $235m tax scam, but he was then charged with the crimes he claimed to have uncovered. Human rights groups allege he was beaten in prison before he died under unclear circumstances. His detention and death ignited serious diplomatic tensions between Russia and some western countries, including the United States . Canada last month passed a Sergei Magnitsky Law, which targets Russian officials for human rights violations. Ottawa followed the Magnitsky Act passed by the US that led to sanctions on more than 40 Russian officials.

RenderPagesVideo('5633184101001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi , has visited Rakhine state for the first time since hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims began fleeing the country to escape a brutal military operation launched in late August. Al Jazeera's Florence Looi, reporting from Yangon, Myanmar's largest city, said on Thursday that Rakhine state government spokesman said she was on the trip to "show there is stability in the region". News of the Myanmar leader's visit comes as a group of US senators consider legislation targeting Myanmar's military for sanctions over the Rohingya crisis. The Myanmar government, led by Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), has downplayed the deadly ethnic violence in Rakhine state despite reports of continued exodus of Rohingya to neighbouring Bangladesh . {articleGUID} Reuters news agency reported that thousands of desperate Rohingya waded through shallows and narrow creeks between islands of the Naf river to reach Bangladesh on Wednesday evening. "The government has been trying to push the narrative that peace and stability have been achieved in Rakhine state after two months of renewed military offensive that began on August 25," Looi said. The NLD organised an interfaith rally in Yangon on Wednesday to showcase Myanmar's multiculturalism. But critics say it was more of a public relations exercise as the Rohingya crisis was not even mentioned at the event. More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled the country [Showkat Shafi/Al Jazeera] More than a half million Rohingya have taken shelter in Bangladesh, fleeing arson, looting and gang rape allegedly being carried out by the military and Buddhist mobs. The military calls it a "clearance operation" planned against Rohingya armed groups who attacked an army base. The UN has called it "textbook ethnic cleansing" - a charge the Myanmar government continues to deny. Aung San Suu Kyi has faced international condemnation for not speaking against the atrocities that the Rohingya have faced. Her government, since succeeding a military regime, has done little to address the plight of one of the most persecuted communities in the world. The ethnic community, the majority of whom are Muslims, has been denied citizenship, rendering it stateless. According to local media, Aung San Suu Kyi visited two villages in Rakhine's Maungdaw district - one of the worst affected by the anti-Rohingya violence. "She apparently took questions from some Rohingya villagers and her advice to them was: 'When you encounter a problem you have to let the government know?'," Al Jazeera's Looi said.

They are left in a very precarious situation. "It also underscores the point how difficult the situation in Rakhine state is despite what the government might say."

Sixteen-year-old Annica Bhar is six months pregnant. Her husband of a year-and-a-half was murdered [Showkat Shafi/Al Jazeera] It is mid-day. The humidity is unbearable. The stench of stale sweat hangs in the air. We are in a small and impoverished Hindu community in the Bangladeshi port city of Cox's Bazar , telling the stories of some of the more than 400,000 Rohingya who have fled neighbouring Myanmar. A 16-year-old girl - one of the minority of Rohingya who are Hindu - is wailing, grieving for her murdered husband. She is six months pregnant. None of the other refugees here pays her much attention. They are too busy with their own sorrows, their own desperate attempts to survive. But a few local men gather, surrounding her. They take out their phones to film and photograph her as she cries. I feel sickened, disgusted by the scene, by the idea that people can feel so detached from the suffering before them that they would choose to record it rather than offer comfort. I feel sick because surely this is what I, as one of the hundreds of journalists who have descended upon the refugee camps here, have been doing. I have photographed and filmed images of desperation and sorrow unlike any I have witnessed before: the mother whose ear had been hacked off and her 10-year-old daughter who lost every other member of their family, the four-year-old whose parents had been killed, the little boy cradling his unconscious baby sister after their father was murdered and they became separated from their mother. Each story seemingly more tragic than the last. A Rohingya boy cradles his unconscious younger sister. Their father was killed and they became separated from their mother as they fled Myanmar [Showkat Shafi/Al Jazeera] I wonder whether to me and other journalists this 16-year-old widow is a story. An opportunity to prove our journalistic credentials. A chance to capture the definitive image of suffering and despair that will somehow encapsulate all the suffering and despair we see around us - crammed into every square foot of this city - or to at least secure a few more likes or television rating points. Annica Bhar looks at their cameras with hope, the same hope with which I have seen others look at mine. She, like them, allows us to photograph her in her most desperate moments, in the hope that our cameras might offer some relief. But they do not. In a few days, I will leave here to return to my comfortable life. I will leave the misery, the disease and the mud behind. But Annica and the other Rohingya refugees will remain. They will stay here begging and tussling for the little aid that arrives, distributed haphazardly from trucks to those who are still strong enough to grab it while the weaker among them lose out. They will stay as epidemics set in in the overcrowded and unsanitary camps, while torrential rains pound their flimsy shelters. And I will wonder what good our pictures did after all.

THE ROHINGYA Who are they? Where are they from? How are they persecuted? How many have fled? What does Myanmar say? What does Bangladesh say? What does the international community say? What is the ARSA? Who are the Rohingya? The Rohingya are often described as "the world's most persecuted minority". They are an ethnic group, majority of whom are Muslim, who have lived for centuries in the majority Buddhist Myanmar . Currently, there are about 1.1 million Rohingya who live in the Southeast Asian country. The Rohingya speak Rohingya or Ruaingga, a dialect that is distinct to others spoken in Rakhine State and throughout Myanmar. They are not considered one of the country's 135 official ethnic groups and have been denied citizenship in Myanmar since 1982, which has effectively rendered them stateless. READ MORE: 'Lost and found booth' reunites Rohingya families Nearly all of the Rohingya in Myanmar live in the western coastal state of Rakhine and are not allowed to leave without government permission. It is one the poorest states in the country with ghetto-like camps and a lack of basic services and opportunities. Due to ongoing violence and persecution, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled to neighbouring countries either by land or boat over the course of many decades. Where are the Rohingya from? Muslims have lived in the area now known as Myanmar since as early as the 12th century, according to many historians and Rohingya groups. The Arakan Rohingya National Organisation has said, "Rohingyas have been living in Arakan from time immemorial," referring to the area now known as Rakhine. During the more than 100 years of British rule (1824-1948), there was a significant amount of migration of labourers to what is now known as Myanmar from today's India and Bangladesh . Because the British administered Myanmar as a province of India , such migration was considered internal, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). The migration of labourers was viewed negatively by the majority of the native population. After independence, the government viewed the migration that took place during British rule as "illegal, and it is on this basis that they refuse citizenship to the majority of Rohingya," HRW said in a 2000 report . This has led many Buddhists to consider the Rohingya to be Bengali, rejecting the term Rohingya as a recent invention, created for political reasons. The UN has called the current exodus of Rohingya 'the most urgent refugee emergency in the world' [Showkat Shafi/Al Jazeera] How and why are they being persecuted? And why aren't they recognised? Shortly after Myanmar's independence from the British in 1948, the Union Citizenship Act was passed, defining which ethnicities could gain citizenship. According to a 2015 report by the International Human Rights Clinic at Yale Law School, the Rohingya were not included. The act, however, did allow those whose families had lived in Myanmar for at least two generations to apply for identity cards. Rohingya were initially given such identification or even citizenship under the generational provision. During this time, several Rohingya also served in parliament. IN PICTURES: Rohingya refugees search for shelter in Bangladesh After the 1962 military coup in Myanmar, things changed dramatically for the Rohingya. All citizens were required to obtain national registration cards. The Rohingya, however, were only given foreign identity cards, which limited the jobs and educational opportunities they could pursue and obtain. In 1982, a new citizenship law was passed, which effectively rendered the Rohingya stateless. Under the law, Rohingya were again not recognised as one of the country's 135 ethnic groups. The law established three levels of citizenship. In order to obtain the most basic level (naturalised citizenship), there must be proof that the person's family lived in Myanmar prior to 1948, as well as fluency in one of the national languages. Many Rohingya lack such paperwork because it was either unavailable or denied to them. As a result of the law, their rights to study, work, travel, marry, practice their religion and access health services have been and continue to be restricted. The Rohingya cannot vote and even if they jump through the citizenship test hoops, they have to identify as "naturalised" as opposed to Rohingya, and limits are placed on them entering certain professions like medicine, law or running for office. Since the 1970s, a number of crackdowns on the Rohingya in Rakhine State have forced hundreds of thousands to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh, as well as Malaysia , Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries. During such crackdowns, refugees have often reported rape, torture, arson and murder by Myanmar security forces. READ MORE: A month of misery for Myanmar's Rohingya After the killings of nine border police in October 2016, troops started pouring into villages in Rakhine State. The government blamed what it called fighters from an armed Rohingya group. The killings led to a security crackdown on villages where Rohingya lived. During the crackdown, government troops were accused of an array of human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killing, rape and arson - allegations the government denied. In November 2016, a UN official accused the government of carrying out "ethnic cleansing" of the Rohingya. It was not the first time such an accusation has been made. In April 2013, for example, HRW said Myanmar was conducting a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya. The government has consistently denied such accusations. Most recently, Myanmar's military has imposed a crackdown on the country's Rohingya population after police posts and an army base were attacked in late August. Residents and activists have described scenes of troops firing indiscriminately at unarmed Rohingya men, women and children. The government, however, has said nearly 100 people were killed after armed men from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) launched a raid on police outposts in the region. Since the violence erupted, rights groups have documented fires burning in at least 10 areas of Myanmar's Rakhine State. More than 500,000 people have fled the violence, with thousands trapped in a no-man's land between the two countries, according to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR). The UN has also said that hundreds of civilians who have tried to enter Bangladesh have been pushed back by patrols. Many have also been detained and forcibly returned to Myanmar. Myanmar does not recognise the Rohingya as an ethnic group [Showkat Shafi/Al Jazeera] How many Rohingya have fled Myanmar and where have they gone? Since the late 1970s, nearly one million Rohingya have fled Myanmar due to widespread persecution. According to the most recently available data from the United Nations in May, more than 168,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar since 2012. Following violence that broke out last year, more than 87,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh from October 2016 to July 2017, according to the International Organization for Migration. READ MORE: 'I want to take my last breath without fear of attacks' Many Rohingya also risked their lives trying to get to Malaysia by boat across the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea. Between 2012 and 2015, more than 112,000 made the dangerous journey. Prior to the violence that began in August, the UN estimated that there are as many as 420,000 Rohingya refugees in Southeast Asia. Additionally, it said there were around 120,000 internally displaced Rohingya. Since the violence in Myanmar's northwest began, more than 500,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh, UNHCR said . It added that more than 1,000 people, mostly Rohingya, may have been killed in Myanmar. What do Aung San Suu Kyi and the Myanmar government say about the Rohingya? State Chancellor Aung San Suu Kyi, who is the de facto leader of Myanmar, has refused to really discuss the plight of the Rohingya. Aung San Suu Kyi and her government do not recognise the Rohingya as an ethnic group and have blamed violence in Rakhine, and subsequent military crackdowns, on those they call "terrorists". The Nobel Peace Prize laureate does not have control over the military but has been criticised for her failure to condemn indiscriminate force used by troops, as well as to stand up for the rights of the more than one million Rohingya in Myanmar. OPINION: Aung San Suu Kyi's inexcusable silence The government has also repeatedly rejected accusations of abuses. In February 2017, the UN published a report that found that government troops "very likely" committed crimes against humanity since renewed military crackdowns began in October 2016. At the time, the government did not directly address the findings of the report and said it had the "the right to defend the country by lawful means" against "increasing terrorist activities", adding that a domestic investigation was enough. In September 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi entrusted former UN chief Kofi Annan with finding ways to heal the long-standing divisions in the region. While many welcomed the commission and its findings, which were released this August, Azeem Ibrahim, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Policy, argued it was just a way for Aung San Suu Kyi to "pacify the global public opinion and try to demonstrate to the international community that she is doing what she can to resolve the issue". Annan was not given the mandate to investigate specific cases of human rights abuses, but rather one for long-term economic development, education and healthcare. REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: They look at us with hope, but we can only document their despair When setting up the commission, Aung San Suu Kyi's government said it would abide by its findings. The commission urged the government to end the highly militarised crackdown on neighbourhoods where Rohingya live, as well as scrap restrictions on movement and citizenship. Following the release of the August report, the government welcomed the commission's recommendations and said it would give the report "full consideration with the view to carrying out the recommendations to the fullest extent ... in line with the situation on the ground". On the latest round of violence, Aung San Suu Kyi condemned a "huge iceberg of misinformation" on the crisis, without mentioning the Rohingya who have fled to Bangladesh. On September 19, she gave a televised address , condemning "all human rights violations" in Rakhine. She said that Myanmar was ready "at any time" to verify the status of those who have fled the violence in the last month. She did not specify who would be qualified to return and did not elaborate on how the verification process would work. Her speech was criticised by Rohingya refugees , as well as activists who accused her government of "burying their heads in the sand". The government has often restricted access to northern Rakhine States for journalists and aid workers. Aung San Suu Kyi's office has also accused aid groups of helping those it considers to be "terrorists". OPINION: Myanmar needs to get serious about peace In January, Yanghee Lee, a UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said she was denied access to certain parts of Rakhine and was only allowed to speak to Rohingya who had been pre-approved by the government. The country has also denied visas to members of a UN probe investigating the violence and alleged abuses in Rakhine. What does Bangladesh say about the Rohingya? There are more than half a million Rohingya refugees living in mostly makeshift camps in Bangladesh. The majority remain unregistered. Bangladesh considers most of those who have crossed its borders and are living outside of camps as having "illegally infiltrated" the country. Bangladesh has often tried to prevent Rohingya refugees from crossing its border. READ MORE: My name is Arba Khatun, I am Rohingya In late January, the country resurrected a plan to relocate tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar to a remote island that is prone to flooding and has also been called "uninhabitable" by rights groups. Under the plan, which was originally introduced in 2015, authorities would move undocumented Myanmar nationals to Thengar Char in the Bay of Bengal. Rights groups have decried the proposal, saying the island completely floods during monsoon season. The UN also called the forced relocation "very complex and controversial". Most recently, Bangladesh's foreign minister labelled the violence against the Rohingya in Myanmar "a genocide". The country's National Commission for Human Rights also said it was considering "pressing for a trial against Myanmar, and against the Myanmar army at an international tribunal" on charges of genocide. Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina visited a Rohingya refugee camp in September and called on the UN and the international community to pressure Myanmar's government to allow the return of hundreds of thousands Rohingya refugees.

The Rohingya have effectively been stateless for decades [Showkat Shafi/Al Jazeera] What does the international community say about the Rohingya? The international community has labelled the Rohingya the "most persecuted minority in the world". The UN, as well as several rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch , have consistently decried the treatment of the Rohingya by Myanmar and neighbouring countries. The UN has said that it is "very likely" that the military committed grave human rights abuses in Rakhine that may amount to war crimes, allegations the government denies. OPINION: Only international pressure can save Rohingya now In March, the UN adopted a resolution to set up an independent, international mission to investigate the alleged abuses. It stopped short of calling for a Commission of Inquiry, the UN's highest level of investigation. The UN investigators must provide a verbal update in September and a full report next year on their findings. Rights groups have criticised the government's reluctance to accept the UN investigators. Human Rights Watch warned that Myanmar's government risked getting bracketed with "pariah states" like North Korea and Syria if it did not allow the UN to investigate alleged crimes. READ MORE: Myanmar - UN probe 'can only aggravate' Rakhine tension In response to the latest round of violence, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned of the risk of ethnic cleansing, calling on Aung San Suu Kyi and the country's security forces to end the violence. In early September, Guterres also warned of a looming "humanitarian catastrophe" if the violence does not end. UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein urged Myanmar to end its "brutal security operation" against the Rohingya in Rakhine, calling it a "textbook example of ethnic cleansing". Both UN officials said they completely supported the findings of the advisory commission, led by Kofi Annan, and urged the government to fulfil its recommendations. OPINION: The Rohingya crisis and the role of the OIC What is the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army? The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), formerly known as the al-Yaqeen Faith Movement, released a statement under its new name in March 2017, saying it was obligated to "defend, salvage and protect [the] Rohingya community". The group said it would do so "with our best capacities as we have the legitimate right under international law to defend ourselves in line with the principle of self defence". The group is considered a "terrorist" organisation by the Myanmar government. In its March statement, the ARSA added that it does "not associate with any terrorist group across the world" and does "not commit any form of terrorism against any civilian[s] regardless of their religious and ethnic origin". The statement also said: "We […] declare loud and clear that our defensive attacks have only been aimed at the oppressive Burmese regime in accordance with international norms and principles until our demands are fulfilled." The group has claimed responsibility for an attack on police posts and an army base in Rakhine State. According to the government nearly 400 people were killed, the majority of whom were members of the ARSA. Rights groups, however, say hundreds of civilians have been killed by security forces. Rights group Fortify Rights said it has documented that fighters with the ARSA "are also accused of killing civilians - suspected government 'informants' - in recent days and months, as well as preventing men and boys from flee Maungdaw Township". On September 9, the group declared a month-long unilateral ceasefire in Rakhine to enable aid groups to address the humanitarian crisis in the area. "ARSA strongly encourages all concerned humanitarian actors resume their humanitarian assistance to all victims of the humanitarian crisis, irrespective of ethnic or religious background during the ceasefire period," the group said in a statement, adding that it calls on Myanmar's military to also temporarily lay down arms. According to the International Crisis group, the ARSA has ties to Rohingya living in Saudi Arabia. The Myanmar government formally categorised the group as a "terrorist" organisation on August 25.

Arba Khatun, 50 [Katie Arnold/Al Jazeera] Arba Khatun , 50, comes from Rakhine State, Myanmar , which she fled a few weeks ago. "My name is Arba Khatun and I am 50 years old. Before the crisis, we lived a fairly good life: We had domestic animals, we had a farm, we cultivated lots of different crops like rice and coconuts. Somehow, we managed. My husband died 15 years ago, so I lived with my son and his family. When I was younger, I used to love working on the farm, but now I am old, so my son does most of the work. I can not remember what day it was, but I had just woken up and was washing my face when the military came to our farm and stole our animals. That is when they fired their gun and a bullet hit my stomach. Luckily, it did not go too deep, but it was very painful and bleeding a lot so my son took me to a nearby doctor. When we returned the whole village had burned to the ground. My son carried me to the mountain, we found his family. We slept there for three days, then he carried me to Bangladesh . We could not bring anything with us because my son was carrying me and his wife was carrying their two children - it was a difficult journey and it took us 12 days. We heard there were some problems at the border, but we crossed easily. I am happy to be in Bangladesh because we are safe here. My wound is healing so I am walking around a lot more, too. But we could not bring any food with us and we have nothing to eat - we have not received any support, we are so hungry. My son would ask the world to help us get our country back, but I don't want to go there again, we will never be safe in Myanmar, we need to do the best we can here in Bangladesh." *As told to Katie Arnold in Kutupalong new shelter camp near Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. *This interview has been edited for clarity.

Nasima, Khatun, 60 [Katie Arnold/Al Jazeera] Nasima Khatun, 60, comes from Rakhine State, Myanmar , which she fled a few weeks ago. "My name is Nasima Khatun and I am 60 years old. We lived a quite life before the crisis, my husband was a fisherman and we had three daughters - we lived very well for Rohingya . Although we encountered some pressure from the military, we did not face any problems with regards to food or shelter. When the military started firing their guns in our village we all ran in different directions. I was hiding in the jungle when someone told me my husband had been shot. I felt helpless and afraid. The military took over the village so I could not return to bring back the body, we had to leave him there and quickly move to Bangladesh . I travelled with my daughters and some neighbours from the village, we could not carry anything with us so we just ate and drank whatever we found on the way. One day, we passed an abandoned shop which we looted - that was the only real food we ate during the 10-day journey; we were so hungry. I cried and cried the whole way so my neighbours took pity on me and paid for our boat trip across to Bangladesh. I was so sad to leave Myanmar, I lost my husband there, my house, my land and everything I own. We've managed to build a shelter here, and the local Bangladeshis have supported us with food donations. But I have no opportunity to earn money, there is no work for us to do. What type of future can we have if we don't have any money? Everyone wants to go back to Myanmar but I don't think that will ever be possible, it will never be safe there again. If we go back we'll be either tortured or killed. I believe the world is watching our situation.

Some migrants are aware of that there is a war in Yemen but decide to embark on the journey to they Yemeni coast anyway [Reuters/Abduljabbar Zeyad] Conflict has been raging in Yemen since 2015, yet people from Somalia , Ethiopia and Eritrea remain undeterred to thread on the perilous routes only to encounter dangerous conditions when they get there. To paraphrase the Somali-British poet Warsan Shire , they continue to flee their lands, as home won't let them stay. Just how dangerous this journey can be was made clear last month, when a boat carrying 150 Somali refugees was attacked by a helicopter and a military ship near the Yemeni port of Hodeidah. At least 42 were killed. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5366906171001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5366906171001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: Yemen refugee boat attack - Survivors speak out (2:07) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Since 2013, nearly 290,000 refugees and migrants have landed on the Yemeni coast. Nearly 80 percent of these were Ethiopians, and most of the rest were Somalis. Most journey to Yemen in the hope of using it as a transit point, while others look to stay in Yemen, often unaware of the dangers. Between January 2006 and April 2016, more than 700,000 persons reportedly crossed from the Horn of Africa to Yemen, with Somalis mostly staying in Yemen as refugees and Ethiopians travelling onwards to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries . So why are people from the Horn still trying to reach a conflict-ridden country and what should be done to stop them from embarking on such a dangerous journey? Awareness doesn't change decisions The Ethiopian state of emergency that was declared October 2016 continues to fuel outward displacement, and Ethiopian asylum seekers interviewed in Yemen, are increasingly referring to the unrest as a key reason for their migration out of the country. Somalis cited a number of reasons for migrating including economic opportunities, tribal conflict, poverty and hardship and conflict between the government and al-Shabab . Two reasons for attempting the journey that most people from the Horn share are a sense of responsibility to their families and positive perceptions of migration.

(25:00) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The most common smuggling route to Yemen starts from Djibouti's coast. Most of the asylum seekers, especially Ethiopians, arriving in Djibouti are aware of the ongoing conflict in Yemen, but think it will not affect them. Some think the ongoing conflict and resulting lack of rule of law, will allow them to disembark and transit through Yemen, more easily and without being stopped by local authorities. A mix of misinformation by brokers and smugglers, political reasons and migration success stories seen on social media and heard through the community grapevine were all significant drivers of migration, even when migrants have some information on the conflict in Yemen. Once they arrive in Djibouti, many face shortages of water and food and have to resort to begging or working menial jobs to pay for the journey to Yemen. These are perilous routes run by well-coordinated networks of smugglers. The smuggler networks between the point of embarkation in Djibouti and disembarkation in Yemen are often coordinated in terms of sharing information on when boats would set off and arrive. Once asylum seekers land in Yemen, they are abducted and taken to smuggling dens for weeks on end, until they pay extortion fees to secure their release. If they are unable to pay, they are beaten, raped, tortured or put to work before eventually being released. Oftentimes other smugglers would recapture those travelling further north after their release. The threat of abduction and kidnapping for ransom remains significant for those moving, and particularly Ethiopian nationals, who are perceived to be able to pay ransoms more readily than Somalis. Awareness campaigns are not enough Various agencies have been campaigning to raise awareness of the dangers of embarking on the journey to Yemen. UNHCR launched the "Dangerous Crossings" campaign in February 2017 featuring a song with prominent musicians from the region. The song is promising in that the various languages of the region are incorporated and the message "thinking carefully before deciding to cross to Yemen" is emphasised. In Somaliland, there's a practice informally known as "hooyo ha tahriibin" (loosely translated as mothers begging their sons, primarily, to not migrate illegally) But how many people thinking of leaving their countries have TV or internet access in order to see the campaign's message? The majority of them receive information primarily through their communities: friends, families, relatives, churches and mosques, radio stations, coffee shop gatherings, et cetera. They are also more likely to value the opinions of people personally known to them rather than celebrities. There is little relation between the would-be asylum seekers and artists featured in this campaign. The campaign also doesn't give details of what the "dangerous crossings" entail. It is void of practical details and real-life examples of what people can expect from this journey. The likelihood of the campaign having a trickle-down effect is therefore quite slim. Therefore, awareness-raising should be done through informal means, using communication channels people are most receptive to. It should incorporate local communities, families and relatives, returnees, respected elders and community figures, church and mosque leaders, local radios' journalists and editors. When possible, viable alternative options also need to be introduced. In Somaliland, there's a practice informally known as "hooyo ha tahriibin" (loosely translated as mothers begging their sons, primarily, to not migrate illegally). It's an incentive where parents purchase cars for their children in an attempt to get them to stay and find a source of local income. Other times, parents intervene by sending their children to universities in neighbouring countries. That being said, these efforts are unlikely to stem migration. As long as the political crises, conflict and security issues, economic, environmental and social problems persist in the region, people will continue to look outwards for better prospects. It is known that a high percentage of new arrivals on the shores of Yemen from the Horn every month are repeat asylum seekers. Approximately 25 percent are estimated to have tried to make the journey to live and work in Yemen or to move through to Saudi Arabia. These findings suggest that informing people about the risks through awareness-raising campaigns may not act as a deterrent, indicating a clear need for a long-term strategy for finding solutions and viable alternatives for a better quality of life. Awareness campaigns are still important because they allow people to make informed decisions and equip them with a full understanding of what lies ahead.

Iraqi firefighters look for bodies buried under the rubble, of civilians who were killed after an air strike against Islamic State triggered a massive explosion in Mosul, March 27 [Reuters] In the past few months the Iraqi army, backed by the US military, has intensified its efforts to recapture Mosul from the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant ( ISIL ). Given the urban context, civilians are paying an extremely heavy price. Indeed, as many as 200 civilians died in mid-March following a US air strike on Mosul al-Jadida neighbourhood. Rescue teams were digging out bodies from the debris for days in what residents described as a "hellish onslaught" and Iraqi officials referred to as the worst US-instigated civilian toll in Iraq since 2003. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5372294560001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5372294560001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > Iraq says 200 bodies pulled from rubble in Mosul PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY In the wake of the Mosul massacre, the military began an investigation into what went wrong. In a press conference, Defence Secretary Jim Mattis claimed that the "enemy hides behind women and children", intimating that ISIL (also known as ISIS) deploys civilians as human shields - an egregious crime according to international law. What Mattis ultimately meant, however, was that the US and Iraqi militaries abide by the laws of war, while ISIL is actually the one to blame for the high civilian death toll in Mosul. This accusation has become a common refrain in many contexts of contemporary urban warfare where the mere proximity of civilians to the fighting effectively transforms them into human shields. It has served as the justification for the murder of civilians when the joint Russian-Syrian regime bombed hospitals in Aleppo as well as in the Saudi-led coalition bombings in Yemen , while Israel has invoked the same argument time and again, both in its war in Lebanon and, more prominently, in the last two wars in Gaza . Given that warfare is increasingly taking place in urban spaces, more and more civilians living in besieged cities are being framed as shields in order to justify high civilian casualties. Indeed, when men, women and children decide to stay in their homes during the fray they can easily be converted into human shields and, as a consequence, can lose some of the protections bestowed upon civilians by international law. Like colonial subjects In order to make sense of how and why human shields clauses are being invoked so widely by a range of different actors, we need to understand the intertwined history of colonialism and international law. In the past, when colonial militaries killed the indigenous population, they did so with impunity, since the colonised were considered outside international law's sphere of application. First, the coalition framed them as human shields who were being exploited by ISIL. Next, the coalition dropped leaflets asking these same residents to remain in their homes. Finally, the coalition bombed the area where it dropped the leaflets. Following decolonisation, the category of civilian and the distinction between civilians and combatants were extended to the ex-colonised, who were then guaranteed protection under the laws of war. Thus, for the first time in modern history the killing of civilians in Africa , the Middle East and in other previously colonised regions was considered a crime according to international law. Accordingly, within our current postcolonial era international law applies to all civilians, even as most fighting takes place in civilian spaces often located in the ex-colonies. It is precisely within this context that we must situate the emergence of the legal phrase human shields, since it, in effect, helps transform civilians into legitimate targets - often along racial lines. During the 2014 Gaza war , for instance, Israel maintained that it took all necessary precautions to reduce Palestinian civilian casualties. Israeli military and legal experts claimed that since the Israeli army dropped leaflets and used other warning methods in order to allow civilians time to leave, those who remained were either belligerents or human shields and therefore the use of lethal violence in the area did not violate the laws of war. Indeed, according to Israel, Hamas was to blame for the civilian deaths because it forced the Palestinian population to stay in their homes and fired rockets from civilian areas. The evisceration of the civilian The events unfolding in Mosul, however, are even more complex than those that took place in Gaza and other urban settings. While it is true that the same refrain - ISIL is using human shields - has been invoked not only by the US and Iraqi militaries but also by such actors as the United Nations in an effort to legitimise the latest causalities, the recent massacre signifies a new and extremely troubling development.

Consequently, Mosul's residents were left with no choice, and their fate was determined in advance. First, the coalition framed them as human shields who were being exploited by ISIL. Next, the coalition dropped leaflets asking these same residents to remain in their homes. Finally, the coalition bombed the area where it dropped the leaflets. This toxic mix of framing hundreds of thousands of people living in the areas controlled by ISIL as human shields and then warning them not to leave their homes before bombing the area, constitutes a further acceleration in the evisceration of the civilian and the loss of protections bestowed upon this legal figure by the laws of war. Indeed, a prominent characteristic of the "war against the new barbarians" is the transformation of civilians into people who can be killed legally, like the colonial subjects of old.

The Nepalese government demolished the only earthquake shelter in Kathmandu, where hundreds sought temporary sanctuary after the 2015 earthquake [EPA/Narendra Shrestha] On April 25, 2015, a powerful earthquake killed nearly 9,000 people and destroyed more than 824,000 homes in Nepal . Shortly after, the country's Reconstruction Authority published a vision for "well-planned resilient settlements and a prosperous society". But it is clearly falling short of that goal because of poor coordination between government and donors, a lack of understanding of local concerns, and a dearth of civic engagement. Two years after a series of earthquakes devastated Nepal, barely 5 percent of the destroyed houses have been rebuilt, according to the National Reconstruction Authority. That 800,000 families still do not have their houses rebuilt is simply a disaster. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5099839497001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5099839497001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > Nepal festival provides relief for earthquake survivors Two winters without shelter There is plenty of blame to go around for the slow reconstruction. The government bears responsibility for failing to work with ministries responsible for distributing reconstruction funds and some donors have been slow to pay out promised funds. Immediately after the disaster, the international community came together to raise $4.1bn for Nepal's reconstruction, which is less than half of the total cost of $9bn. Those funds, plus locally raised revenues, were meant to be disbursed in tranches to households needing to rebuild their homes. READ MORE: Nepal - the Maoist dream The process, however, is onerous. Only 12 percent of the money has been distributed. Only 544,996 families have received their first payment, which is only 17 percent of the total government grants for house building. Just 20,889 homes had been rebuilt as of April 6, according to the National Reconstruction Authority . Progress has been painfully slow for families who have now spent two winters without proper shelter. Many live in makeshift huts and bamboo tents. Further, problems on the ground have been ignored. Shortages of water and other raw materials mean that even families that receive payouts are unable to begin building. Some families have had to travel for several days to reach local government offices to sign up for the compensation they have been promised. Others struggle to find materials and skilled workers to build walls. Still others have waited months for inspectors to check the foundation work so that the next tranche of funding can be released. Lack of information International community can bring about more lasting change by directing their support towards citizens and local organisations committed to solving the root problems of corruption and lack of information. Part of the problem has been lack of transparency and information for the general public on how the process of reconstruction should proceed. Whether it's making sure that people understand the timeline for compensation disbursements or knowing where to go for help, the government must be transparent and proactive in communication. The lack of information has been a major challenge for many Nepalis, especially the poor and the disadvantaged. Take Sunita Danuwar as an example. She is a single woman who was unable to access the rebuilding funds because she had no citizenship card. She had been married as a child and her husband left her for another woman. In Nepal, women obtain citizenship cards through their fathers or husbands. Having neither, Sunita was left unable to access government relief funds. It took more than a year and the assistance of a nonprofit organisation for Sunita to connect with a government official who helped her obtain a citizenship card. Another man, Kabiraj Pariyar, waited for more than five months for an engineer to inspect his rebuilt foundation so that he could qualify for another government grant. It wasn't until he connected with an advocate that he was able to get past this first step in rebuilding. At the Accountability Lab , my colleagues and I set up a resource called Citizen Helpdesks to gather and disseminate details to close information gaps between the government, the media, donor organisations and communities. This has grown into a platform for feedback from citizens on a range of issues such as migration, government services and education. Armed with feedback from the Helpdesks and other groups working in Nepal, government should be more responsive and citizens can better understand their role in recovery. Local elections coming While it is encouraging that Pariyar and Danuwar found resources to help in their efforts to rebuild, the process can't be this burdensome or slow. There is much more to be done and the biggest step forward may come in May, when Nepal will hold local elections for the first time in 20 years. These 34,203 directly elected representatives will give local communities a louder voice in national decisions. Their first priority should be completing the earthquake recovery.

They can monitor progress in reconstruction efforts, provide oversight on the quality of the work and guard against the misuse of funds. The local authority can solve problems raised by citizens by providing space to discuss issues within the village and municipal council. They are a strong connection between central government, citizens and donor agencies. They are the voices of citizen. In times of crisis, international aid is essential to help alleviate suffering. But the international community can bring about more lasting change by directing their support towards citizens and local organisations committed to solving the root problems of corruption and lack of information. My hope is that when the next earthquake anniversary rolls around in 2018, all Nepali citizens will have rebuilt both their homes and their hope as they strive towards a more prosperous, safe and inclusive future.

10.7 million people in the Lake Chad Basin urgently need urgent support today, writes Carius [Afolabi Sotunde/Reuters] Poverty, hunger, suffering. These terms seem inadequate to describe what I witnessed in the Lake Chad Basin, the West African region that is host to the one of the world's worst - and certainly its most neglected - humanitarian crisis since 1945. The crisis in the West African region, which includes parts of Nigeria , Chad, Niger, and Cameroon , has left approximately 10.7 million people in need of immediate humanitarian assistance. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5569410908001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5569410908001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > INSIDE STORY: What's behind world's recent extreme weather events? (25:16) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The human face of this crisis is devastating. When I visited the region as part of a mission with the World Food Programme in May this year, I saw desperate hunger, displacement, and shocking levels of violence and insecurity facing civilians, especially women and girls. Civilians live with the daily threat of rape, kidnappings, killings and terrorist attacks. Over 2.4 million people have been displaced by the crisis, but there are simply aren't the resources to meet the most basic needs of these people in the refugee or displaced peoples camps or urban centres where they end up. With little or nothing left to trade for vital resources like food, sexual exploitation ( sex-for-food as it is known) has become the norm, even within the camps. A report released this week by the UN Secretary-General affirms all I witnessed on the ground in the Lake Chad Basin. It underscores the overwhelming scale of the crisis, and the need for urgent and immediate humanitarian responses. But it doesn't quite go as far as thinking about a long-term solution. In my view, the short-term and long-term responses simply cannot be separated, without being detrimental to both. In order to tackle this crisis with any kind of sustainability - even in the short-run - there needs to be a thorough understanding of what caused it to spiral in the first place. While the current crisis was triggered by violence linked to armed groups such as Boko Haram , discussions I had with people in the region, and expert consultations convened by my organisation on the issue, agree on some root causes. OPINION: Lake Chad Basin - World's most neglected crisis rages on Everyone I met agreed that the situation has deep roots in long-standing developmental challenges, namely widespread inequality and decades of political marginalisation of the communities in the region. The lack of investment from national governments in basic services like health and education in the region meant that these communities felt alienated and left behind. In a sense, this is no different from the frustrations felt by certain communities in the UK pre- Brexit , and in the US pre- Trump , pushing them towards extreme alternatives. In the Lake Chad Basin, over time, this has instilled a deep sense of exclusion and lack of trust between communities and the government. Against this backdrop, the region also faces significant environmental stress. The only effective solutions will be ones that address the underlying causes of the crisis, that are durable and sensitive to the environmental changes brought about by a warming world. Frequent prolonged droughts in the region mean there is less water and arable land to go around. In a predominantly farming and pastoral society dependent on the mighty Lake Chad for survival, less water means not just fewer jobs but also extreme poverty. I heard many accounts of exacerbated tensions between pastoralists, farmers and fishers. The risk of hunger and unemployment makes young people more vulnerable to recruitment by non-state armed groups such as Boko Haram and illicit employment, and also feeds into armed conflict and contributes to widespread internal as well as cross-border displacement. To be clear: climate change does not create terrorists, nor does it turn law-abiding citizens into criminals. But a warming world acts as a threat multiplier , worsening existing risks and making it harder to work on solutions. Social stability demands food and water. As these resources become increasingly scarce, I could see communities become increasingly desperate. What are young people to do when there are no jobs available? Some choose to join a militant group like Boko Haram, which can offer consistent salary and calories when they recruit in farming and fishing villages. Farmers I spoke with explained how the wheat harvest is now a particularly dangerous time for them as Boko Haram insurgents come in to loot the harvest in order to feed their soldiers. Boko Haram also provide access to services such as education, which in the absence of functioning schools and trained teachers, brings eager parents and children into their influence. Not everyone joins armed groups, though the alternatives are still not positive. Others may take up petty crime. Or more violent crime. Women and girls are increasingly pushed into prostitution just to survive. OPINION: Solutions for tumultuous times These ongoing emergencies - the hunger, the violence, the breakdown of law and order - aren't a tragic coincidence. Rather, there is a complex interplay between many factors that create the conditions for such social collapse and suffering. In considering these factors, climate change cannot be ignored, for it exacerbates the worst catalysts of the crisis and fuels the fragility that has inflamed the region. As the UN strives to raise funds and coordinate government responses to the crisis, we must recognise that the problems will only be solved if we understand the effect climate change is having on these social stressors. The only effective solutions will be ones that address the underlying causes of the crisis, that are durable and sensitive to the environmental changes brought about by a warming world. 10.7 million people in the Lake Chad Basin urgently need urgent support today. But the emergency relief we provide will be nothing more than a temporary respite if we do not address the vicious accelerant of fragility that is climate change. Just as climate change is part of the problem, so too can it be part of the solution. Alexander Carius is cofounder and managing director of adelphi .

(1:47) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The council on Friday mandated Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the UN rights chief, to send a group of "eminent experts" to Yemen , where a Saudi-led coalition has been bombing Houthi rebels since March 2015. The compromise was reached after Saudi Arabia and other Arab states presented an amended draft resolution that was adopted by consensus without a vote, including by Yemen's delegation. The investigation will give the strongest international component yet to an examination of abuses by all warring parties in a country that the UN says faces the world's greatest humanitarian disaster. READ MORE: Yemen cholera outbreak could hit one million by 2018 Launching the probe marks a victory for a group of European countries and Canada which pushed hard for an international inquiry fully independent of the Yemeni national investigation, which the Saudis support. The Saudi-led coalition has been accused of bombing schools, markets, hospitals and other civilian targets in support of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi . Houthi rebels, who control much of northern Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa, have also been accused of major violations, which the UN team will also probe. Al Jazeera's Rosiland Jordan, reporting from the UN headquarters in New York, said the group of experts will head to Yemen "as soon as possible and will be expected to gather their evidence and present it to the Human Rights Council a year from now". READ MORE: Saudi coalition kills hundreds of Yemenis in 2017: UN Saudi Arabia had for the past two years succeeded in blocking the rights chief's call for an international investigation. In a letter leaked to several media outlets this week, the kingdom threatened economic and diplomatic retaliation against council members who would vote in favour of the EU/Canadian proposal. The Saudi envoy to the council, Abdulaziz Alwasil, ended up endorsing Friday's resolution, which was slightly softer than previous EU proposals. An earlier Dutch/Canadian draft had asked for a Commission of Inquiry (COI) in Yemen, the UN's highest level investigation, but that call was removed from the adopted version. Countries with significant and lucrative ties to Saudi Arabia, including the US , Britain and France, were reported to be seeking a compromise between the EU and Arab camps, which were deadlocked through the week on a resolution. The war in Yemen has killed more than 10,000 people, according to the UN. More than 17 million Yemenis are now facing dire food shortages, and a nationwide cholera epidemic has killed more than 2,100 people since April.

Lowcock is on his first visit to Yemen since taking up his UN post [M Huwais/Getty Images] The UN's aid chief has arrived in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, expressing his deep concern about the war-torn country's deteriorating humanitarian crisis. Mark Lowcock is on his first visit to Yemen since being appointed under-secretary-general and emergency relief coordinator on September 1. "I have come to Sanaa to have discussions with the authorities and other interlocutors on ways to improve the humanitarian situation in Yemen," he said upon arrival in Sanaa on Wednesday. Lowcock added his five-day visit to the country was aimed at reaffirming "the strong commitment of the United Nations and partners to alleviate suffering of all Yemenis in need of assistance". Cholera, malnutrition Yemen has been devastated by more than two and a half years of war after Houthi rebels captured Sanaa and overthrew President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government. A Saudi-led coalition was formed in 2015 to fight the Houthi rebels and army troops allied with them. According to the UN , the conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and left over seven million in need of food assistance.

Refugees in the Manus centre protest against their detention by holding up signs [Courtesy @ManusAlert Telegram] On Tuesday, Australia will close the offshore camp on Manus Island after the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea (PNG) ruled last year that the detention of refugees there was unconstitutional. Food, water and electricity will be cut off, leaving more than 600 refugees fearful for their future. Most have lived on Manus for years, after Australia decided it did not want the refugees on its mainland; now, they will be relocated to the PNG town of Lorengau. Al Jazeera spoke with four refugees about how they ended up on Manus, their treatment by Australia, and their thoughts about the future. Persia: 'We are like lab rats' Persia arrived in Australia in 2013, in a boat with 80 other refugees fleeing from Indonesia. It was his second attempt; his first boat, carrying about 60 people, sank. Shipwrecked on a small island, Persia and the other survivors were eventually saved and brought back to Indonesia. Despite almost dying the first time, Persia was determined to make it to Australia, and he tried again. Upon arrival on Australian shores, however, the group was immediately arrested by Australian authorities and sent to Manus. Refugees in the Manus detention centre protest against the way they are treated by crossing their arms [Courtesy @ManusAlert Telegram] "All people were brought by force, in handcuffs, to Manus Island," said Persia, who spoke to Al Jazeera under a pseudonym for fear of repercussions. "I thought Australia was a country which applied human rights, but I was totally wrong." His treatment over the last few years has led Persia to distrust anyone acting on behalf of the Australian or PNG governments. "We are like lab rats," he said. "I have been monitored by the Australian government for 4.5 years. They know what I like and dislike, and what colour is my underwear, and my family, and my weaknesses, and all details. "I don't see any future," he added. "Honestly, death is better than this slavery." {articleGUID} In recent months, parts of the Manus detention centre have been prepared for the removal of the refugees. Fox Camp, the largest living area, was the first to be closed, with residents forced to crowd into other areas. Facilities and services such as the gym, library and access to English classes have been cut off. "We all are in extreme stress," Persia said. "The situation is extremely horrible ... There is no future for me, because the cruel government doesn't want me to live like a human being." In the days leading to the closure of Manus, several signs were placed around the camp, warning the refugees that other facilities would gradually be shut down as well. On Sunday, the mess was closed, and food packets were distributed among the refugees - two packets per person, barely enough to get them through the two remaining days. The meals are to be prepared on a microwave or stove, but neither is available to the refugees in the camp. A small salad is provided as well, but the refugees do not have refrigerators to keep it from going bad. Moving to Lorengau is not an option for Persia, he said, as other refugees have done so only to face abuse at the hands of an unwelcoming local community. "They said they would cut everything off to push people to move out, but we will stay inside, because inside is safe," he said. "We don't want to move out. [We will stay] until they shoot us." Boochani: 'Living in a war zone' Kurdish-Iranian journalist Behrouz Boochani arrived to Manus in 2013 after fleeing the city of Ilam in Iran for fear of imprisonment, after the offices of the newspaper where he worked were raided and 11 of his colleagues arrested. In a first attempt to reach Australia, his boat sank, and he barely survived; the second time, his boat was spotted by the Australian navy. {articleGUID} Even in captivity, Boochani has remained true to his profession. One of the most outspoken people in Manus camp, he says he hopes that talking about the abysmal conditions will make others listen. "The situation in Manus prison camp is like we are living in a war zone, because the refugees are ready for something bad to happen," he told Al Jazeera. "At any time, soldiers could attack the prison camp." The option of relocating to Lorengau is a bad one, Boochani said. This food packet is supposed to last each refugee for two days [Courtesy @ManusAlert Telegram] "The local people are very angry with the Australian government, because they feel that the government humiliated them and did not care about their wants," he said. "They are ready to send their message to Australia through beating up the refugees. They already did that a lot of times, and a lot of refugees were beaten up and robbed by local people. "This place is not a safe place for the refugees, because there is not any protection for them." The looming prospect of PNG security forces swooping in to clear Manus camp is a frightening one for Boochani . Earlier this year, nine refugees were injured after a small dispute with security forces escalated and shots were fired, he said. A deal between the United States and Australia, under which the US has promised to take in an unspecified number of people from Manus and Nauru, has raised hopes for some, while others remain sceptical. "Why is it that Australia and the world don't want to understand this simple thing - that the refugees did not come to this country and don't want to be here?" Boochani asked. "Why don't they want to understand that these people have been tortured for more than four years?" Abdul: 'An animal in a zoo' Abdul arrived on Christmas Island, an Australian territory, in July 2013 after fleeing from the conflict in Afghanistan. He was unaware that Australia had just struck a deal with PNG and Nauru for offshore detention centres, and that he would be sent to Manus. Several others who had travelled on his boat were sent to Nauru, which houses single women and families. A year later, in June 2014, Abdul, who declined to provide his last name, was officially recognised as a refugee. "I was offered to resettle in Papua New Guinea," he told Al Jazeera. "I'm resisting it to this very day, afraid I will be attacked by locals. Most of the locals do not want us here." Reports of refugees being beaten and robbed after moving from Manus to Lorengau have been rampant, with some later opting to move back to the relative safety of Manus. Ronny Knight, a former representative for Manus in the PNG parliament, said after two refugees were beaten on New Year's Eve by Lorengau police: "[They] deserved what they got ". And now, with the Manus detention centre closing, the governor of Manus has threatened to block the transfer of the refugees to a new facility, saying he could not guarantee their safety. Abdul says he has no plans to leave the detention centre. Refugees hold up signs to protest against their treatment by the Australian and PNG governments [Courtesy @ManusAlert Telegram] "We're staying, because we want a solution to our endless suffering. We are in danger," he said. "Everyone in detention is so scared. The mood is very down. We have fear that we will be removed forcibly to Lorengau." After more than four years of staying quiet, Abdul said the pressure has built to the point where he had to speak out. "Australia treats me like an animal in a zoo. I have experienced trauma, depression, stomach problems ... I've never been scared like I am now," he added. "I have lost everything, so I'll speak against injustice. " Abdul and some of his peers pooled their money to buy a few mobile phones, with credits provided by sympathetic Australians. Using these phones, they have posted photos and statements about their deteriorating conditions on a public Telegram channel called Manus Alert. It is their only real connection to the outside world. Still, as the closure of the detention centre approaches, Abdul has no faith in the future. "I don't see any future here. My hope is crushed," he said. "In Afghanistan, I had a way out. Here, I do not see any way out." Amir: 'Death is waiting for us outside of this centre' Amir fled Iran at the age of 15. After spending several years in Malaysia, he left for Australia with the goal of applying for political and religious asylum. He eventually arrived on Christmas Island, but was sent to Manus in 2013. {articleGUID} "Imagine being in a prison on a tropical island, thousands of kilometres away from home. No lawyer, no sentence and no rights. No nothing," Amir told Al Jazeera. Amir, an aspiring writer and actor who studied literature and humanities, says the already bad conditions that the refugees have been living in for years have recently deteriorated. "Dirty food, dirty conditions, malaria, terrible treatment by the guards and in some cases, assaults and insults," he said. "And now, they want to cut running water, power, food, drinking water - and they want to remove the fencing that protects refugees from attacks by the locals." The announcement of the mess hall closing was posted in the Manus detention centre earlier this month [Courtesy @ManusAlert Telegram] As a result, he says, the mental and physical health of the refugees has greatly been affected, especially after part of the centre was closed down earlier this year. However, like the majority of people living there, Amir does not plan on moving from the camp. "East Lorengau is another limbo, and if we move there, the Australian government can claim they have closed Manus detention [centre], which is false. That place can't hold more than 400 people and is a mental illness factory," he said. With only hours left before the camp shuts down and the refugees are forcibly moved, Amir says that a bleak future awaits him. "Right now, the only thing we can do is to resist the move, as we know death is waiting for us outside this centre," he said. " We know that without food and water, we are dead too, but at least we don't walk to our death with our own feet. " Interviews for this story were conducted via WhatsApp and quotes were edited for grammar and clarity. SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Refugees Australia Papua New Guinea Humanitarian crises Asia Pacific
Guterres, left, shakes hands with people at Bangassou Cathedral Bangui, Central African Republic [Joel Kouam/The Associated Press] Resurgent violence sweeping across Central African Republic has left a record 1.1 million people destitute and homeless, the UN has said. The number of people who have been internally displaced has increased by 50 percent since January 2017. At least 600,000 are internally displaced across the country, while another 500,000 have found themselves across the border in Chad , Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo and Cameroon . The latest data released by UNOCHA comes as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres continues on his four-day visit to CAR on Thursday in what he describes as a "visit of solidarity but of active solidarity". He has been lobbying for 900 more peacekeepers to join the mission and urged the international community to take action over a crisis that has killed thousands and destabilised the country. "I think the conditions for civilians in CAR is worse than 2014," Stephanie Wolters, Central Africa analyst at the Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria, told Al Jazeera. "More and more people are in need than ever before." Right now, civilians don't have access to aid and aid workers don't have access to civilians Eric Batonon, Norwegian Refugee Council CAR has been beset with conflict since Seleka coalition rebels marched into the capital, Bangui, and deposed of former President Francois Bozize. Though the country held elections in February 2016, the government has been unable to stem the conflict. The administration is mostly absent outside the capital, with armed groups controlling large swaths of the countryside. {articleGUID} Eric Batonon, country director of Norwegian Refugee Council, based in Bangui, told Al Jazeera that part of the solution would be increasing protection. Resurgent fighting between factions of Seleka rebels and Anti-balaka militia has deepened instability in the northwest and southeastern parts of the country. This has forced aid agencies to leave their stations in some areas where humanitarian needs are high. "Right now, civilians don't have access to aid and aid workers don't have access to civilians. "If anything, it is clear that the situation is very critical; the fact that humanitarian actors continue to be targeted, means that situation is getting worse," he said. At least 12 peacekeepers have been killed since the beginning of 2017, he added. Wolters commended the UN's Guterres for his CAR visit, but warned against sending more UN peacekeepers. "This is an intractable conflict, an unresolved one, and one has to appreciate that [ Guterres] has gone there," she said. "One of the problems is that the traditional tools of UN peacekeeping have not worked in places like CAR, or Burundi or the DRC, for that matter. This method of forming peace agreements and then holding elections, it has not worked. "These methods have not ended conflict. We have to find ways to disincentivize the call to arms in the CAR." On Wednesday, Guterres told displaced people at a camp in the eastern of Bangassou that he was moved by their suffering. "Sadly, what is happening here in Bangassou is not unique. Thousands of other Central Africans have had to flee," he said. Guterres also attended a wreath-laying ceremony in the capital to pay homage to 12 peacekeepers that were killed in 2017. On #UNday , I pay tribute to UN peacekeepers working for peace in the Central African Republic and around the world. @UN_CAR pic.twitter.com/XPOOPLmJr3 — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) October 24, 2017 The UN mission to CAR has been routinely accused of sexually exploiting and abusing women and children in the country. Guterres told Al Jazeera he would be meeting survivors of sexual abuse by UN peacekeepers in the capital. He said the UN have taken "a number of measures to put the victims at the centre [of policy]".

RenderPagesVideo('5598833700001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Caught in the middle of a war of words between US President Donald Trump and politicians in Puerto Rico , the debt-riddled and impoverished US territory is suffering from severe food shortages, a lack of clean water, and widespread power outages after Hurricane Maria slammed into the island last month. The White House has appeared to walk back on Donald Trump's suggestion that Puerto Rico's $72bn in debt should be cancelled so the island can recover from the hurricane's devastation. Prior the hurricane, the island had undergone a severe austerity programme for several years in order to pay its debts, leaving the US territory's infrastructure vulnerable to damage. READ MORE: Puerto Ricans denounce US hurricane relief efforts As politicians decide what to do about the island's debt and recovery, Puerto Rican community groups are taking matters into their own hands. Xiomara Caro-Diaz is a lawyer and activist who is overseeing 15 community groups on the island that are leading recovery efforts where they say the government is falling short. Al Jazeera's Shihab Rattansi spoke to Caro-Diaz in the capital San Juan about the progress being made, Trump's response and what lies ahead for the devastated US territory. Al Jazeera: Is the work now an extension what you all were doing before the hurricane? Xiomara Caro-Diaz : Well, in a way it's a deepening of what we were doing already, but it's also the urgency that has come with it. It's like a veil has been lifted off of Puerto Rico and it's now for the world to see the poverty that already existed and what it means in terms of poor infrastructure, the impact of a hurricane of this magnitude. In the end, it feels like the hurricane was just the beginning, and what has happened afterwards feels like we're still in the middle of a storm. Al Jazeera: What are the connections between the austerity measures that were already under way and what's happening now as a result of the hurricane? Caro-Diaz : Puerto Rico is $72bn [in] debt, and that's directly connected to the economic policies that Congress passed that allowed specific industries like the pharmaceutical industry, which made millions and billions of dollars off of Puerto Rico. At the same time, the infrastructure suffers. They [these industries] don't pay taxes. So, you have a place that has historically been kept poor, that has been used to make billions of dollars and extract wealth, and at the time same time, the infrastructure that goes from people's homes, which they don't make enough money to have a cement home, so the impact is much worse. But it also goes to the extent of what happens to our roads, the electricity. How is it that after we have made so much money for all these industries, [but] nothing is left behind? Al Jazeera: Donald Trump says he wants to forgive Puerto Rico's debt. What do you make of that? Caro-Diaz : I'd like to see that on paper. I think that Donald Trump is someone difficult to trust, who came here and ridiculed the people of Puerto Rico. It was embarrassing to watch the governor laugh while he [Trump] was making jokes about Puerto Rico, and even diminishing the amount of people that we have lost and the amount of deaths that we've had, some of which we haven't even counted for. So if that's true, I want to see it on paper. SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Hurricane Humanitarian crises Poverty & Development Puerto Rico United States
RenderPagesVideo('5630580429001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); A Manus Island detention centre where more than 600 refugees have spent several years after trying to reach Australia will be closed on Tuesday by Papua New Guinea (PNG) authorities. The 600 men that are held in the centre will be forcibly moved to new facilities in Lorengau, a city about five kilometres from the detention centre, officials said. Australia has used Manus as an offshore detention centre since 2013, when the country struck a deal with PNG and Nauru to hold refugees fleeing to Australia in camps on the islands. However, in 2015, the PNG Supreme Court ordered that the Manus detention centre should be closed because it is unconstitutional. Parts of the camp have already shut. On Sunday, the mess hall was closed and food packages were handed out to the refugees. A message posted inside the detention centre earlier on Tuesday stated that access to water and electricity would be cut off, and that the refugees were "advised to move to alternative accommodation now". "From tomorrow, arrangements will be under way for the return to this site to the PNGDF [PNG Defense Force]. Anyone choosing to remain here will be liable for removal from an active PNG military base", the statement said, referencing the fact the detention centre is originally a naval base. The final message posted at the Manus detention centre, urging refugees to move out [Courtesy of @ManusAlert Telegraam] Nick McKim, MP for the Green Party in Australia, said the closure of the camp does not solve anything. "In the absence of resettlement in a safe country, the closure of the centre is not a solution at all. The best and easiest solution to this humanitarian disaster is to resettle the men in Australia," a spokesman for McKim told Al Jazeera. "These men sought refuge in Australia and they remain Australia's responsibility, legally and morally." {articleGUID} Elaine Pearson, Australia Director of Human Rights Watch (HRW), told Al Jazeera that the camp should be closed in line with the PNG Supreme Court ruling. "But the people held there should be brought to safety in Australia or other third countries, not abandoned to stay in less-secure facilities run by the PNG government on Manus Island," she added. Uncertain future ahead More than 600 refugees have lived in the detention centre since 2013. Their treatment by Australia and PNG has been the centre of criticism by both people living in the camp and human rights organisations. But despite the impending closure of the camp, the refugees do not want to move to Lorengau because they are afraid of what might happen to them there. {articleGUID} "Refugees don't want to move because they don't feel safe. They are terrified given an escalation in brutal attacks against refugees and asylum seekers in Lorengau town. Some have even occurred in daytime," Pearson said. "Police have failed to investigate these attacks." McKim's spokesman echoed this sentiment. "Many of them fear leaving the centre, having seen their friends being attacked by the local community. They are also deeply fearful of being forcibly removed and placed into danger somewhere else." The refugees confirmed these fears in a series of interviews with Al Jazeera. "Right now, the only thing we can do is to resist the move, as we know death is waiting for us outside this centre," Amir, an Iranian refugee, told Al Jazeera. The over 600 refugees are afraid of moving out of the camp because they fear retaliation by the locals. [File: @ManusAlert Telegram] Despite the lack of water, food and electricity in the camp, Amir said that staying at the facility was their only option. "We know that without food and water, we are dead too, but at least we don't walk to our death with our own feet," he said. The refugees are also uncertain what would happen to them if they indeed move to Lorengau. Those whose asylum applications are approved, are expected to blend into the local community. Those who are denied asylum will be either sent back to their home country if it is deemed safe for them to go back, or they will be held in detention indefinitely until a third country offers to take them in. In addition to feared hostilities by Manus locals, and the uncertainty about what will happen to them once they move to Lorengau, the current state of the centres there also worries the refugees. "The new camps are not all finished, which means there simply are not enough beds ready for the men. This is untenable and unfair," the spokesman for McKim said. One of the solutions that Australia has offered is to move the refugees to third countries. Australia has a refugee deal with the United States, but the US has only taken in about 50 refugees as of yet, and has not stated how many it is willing to take in total. Another option is New Zealand, which has offered to take in 150 refugees. However, there are about 1,600 refugees in all of Australia's offshore detention centres. Besides Manus, there is the Nauru camp as well. "Like Manus Island, Nauru is not a suitable place for refugees. The Greens urge the government to close the Nauru detention centre and bring the men, women and children to Australia," HWR's Pearson said, adding that Australia is still responsible for those who do not get to move to thirds countries.

Trauma surgeon Shazeer Majeed has worked for Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Yemen , South Sudan and Iraq . He is now working in northern Syria, a region gripped by instability, and shares his day-to-day reality of trying to keep victims of war alive. "We usually think of the remnants of war as unexploded shells, bombs or IEDs. But as a trauma surgeon working in an MSF hospital in Tal Abyad, the nearest secondary health facility to Raqqa city with surgical capacity, I have seen a different kind of remnant - the lethal injuries and damage that these weapons leave behind. The effect of high-energy explosives, like those used by the warring parties in Raqqa, can be catastrophic for the human body. Most often injuries are fatal if the person is in close range of the bomb, rocket, shell or submunitions and the immediate blast effect. If the person is lucky enough be further away from the direct impact, they are likely to experience secondary effects from the blast wave and high energy projectiles which cause considerable damage to the solid and hollow viscera - injuries such as bleeding into the chest, lacerations to the liver, spleen and kidneys, gastric and bowel perforations, and open bone fractures with associated vascular and soft tissue injury. The operating theatre after a surgery conducted in Tal Abyad general hospital, northern Syria [Courtesy: MSF] Yesterday, while on ward rounds, I got called to the emergency room to see two young sisters. These young women both lost a limb from an air strike five days ago, they have travelled for two long days to reach the Tal Abyad Hospital. One sister aged 20 years presented with an amputation above the elbow, the other sister aged 15 years had an amputation above the knee. Both had undergone their first surgery elsewhere before they reached the MSF facility, but their amputated wounds had been prematurely sutured closed and now are both severely infected. In a trauma setting, even a highly-trained team struggles to counteract surgery's effects on a severely injured patient Both young women need to go back to the theatre urgently, so their wounds can be reopened and we can contain the infection. Surgically there are no choices in this instance: it is imperative to limit the spread of infection through aggressive debridement, which results in the residual limbs inevitably being shortened. The 15-year-old now has a disarticulated hip, which means complete removal of the lower limb from the hip joint. This type of amputation is not easy to fit with an artificial limb, which means this young woman will likely spend much of her future in a wheelchair, a difficult reality to confront at any age. The day before while still in theatre, I stepped out to evaluate a 20-year-old male in the emergency room. His body is littered with what we routinely describe as shrapnel, but in reality it is metallic fragments of the bomb or shell, or other objects and debris expelled by the explosion. These fragments seared through this young man's body causing massive internal bleeding and damage to his chest and abdomen, and caused multiple open fractures in his lower limbs. He is immediately transferred to the operating theatre, where every minute matters. Several long hours later, he has survived multiple surgeries to close the chest, explore the abdomen, to identify and stop the source of bleeding, removal of his spleen and fixation for the fractured lower limbs. Luckily, this young man will fully recover, albeit slowly. There is nothing unusual about these three patients, nothing that differentiates their injuries from the scores I have treated over the last week, the same kind of injuries, the same kind of destruction. The ruins of Raqqa, Syria, captured in an image on October 18 [Erik De Castro/Reuters] Outcomes in war surgery are associated primarily with two critical elements. Firstly, adequate resuscitation, as soon as possible after the injury and the second is the quality and timing of the initial formal surgery in the operating theatre. The concept of the 'golden hour' refers to the notion that any delay in resuscitation worsens survival outcomes. In northern Syria there are very few stabilisation points operating near the front lines around Raqqa - assuming that wounded patients can even navigate through the city to reach them. Raqqa city is upwards of three hours' drive away from the MSF hospital in Tal Abyad. Surviving the three-hour long ambulance journey with severe and life-threatening injuries is the biggest challenge. In a trauma setting, even a highly-trained team struggles to counteract surgery's effects on a severely injured patient. After nearly seven years of war, health services in northern Syria are limited, constrained by lack of trained staff as many health workers have fled, displaced or been killed. Medical supplies are scarce due to the fragility of transport routes by which to import them, and health facilities have been damaged and neglected. Salvaging the body from the brutal consequences of explosive weapons and devices is my everyday reality in northern Syria Salvaging the body from the brutal consequences of explosive weapons and devices is my everyday reality in northern Syria. Over the last months we have treated hundreds of people injured from the conflict and even as the current military offensive draws to an end, we unfortunately expect to continue to see blast-injured patients who encounter landmines and IEDs in Raqqa. We will inevitably continue to witness the devastating physical and psychological reminders of war among this population for a very long time to come. The phone rings again, time to head to the emergency room, another blast patient is on the way." SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Humanitarian crises Syria's Civil War
Myanmar's military crackdown on the country's Rohingya has resulted in the killing of more than 400 men, women and children and has driven hundreds of thousands out of the country. More than 500,000 Rohingya refugees are now in Bangladeshi refugee camps. Of them, more than half are in unregistered camps, where food, shelter, drinking water and sanitation are a luxury. The refugees carry harrowing stories of mass killings, gang rapes and razing of whole villages, enough to break down even the most seasoned journalists.

Shaheen said it's up to Arab Americans to challenge the status quo in pop culture [ACCESS] Jack Shaheen featured prominently in my life from a very young age, and I was inspired by his work even before I was old enough to read. When I heard that he passed away, I felt as though I had lost a member of my family. I remember seeing The TV Arab on my parents' bookshelf as a child, shortly after we moved from Lebanon to the United States . Even though I was only five years old at the time, I knew there was something wrong with the scary-looking caricature on the cover. But it wasn't until I watched Delta Force (1986) with Chuck Norris two years later that I started to understand the focus of Shaheen's work and grasp its importance. He was the son of Lebanese Christian immigrants who devoted most of his life to combating the overwhelmingly negative portrayal of Arabs and Muslims in film. Arabs and Muslims in Hollywood Over the years, I saw recurring examples of Arabs being demonised on the big screen. The trend was best exemplified by movies like Navy SEALs (1990), Patriot Games (1992), True Lies (1994), and Executive Decision (1998). By the time I graduated from high school, there was no doubt in my mind that Hollywood had a serious problem with its portrayal of Arabs and Muslims. During my second year of college, I grudgingly bought tickets to watch a movie that would upset me more than any other up until that point. One of the main characters in The Siege (1998) shared my last name - the images of his family members being rounded up and placed in a makeshift prison camp struck a nerve. Throughout the movie, Muslims were shown to have a complete disregard for humanity, so the happy ending when all the detainees were freed rang hollow for me and countless others. OPINION: Jack Shaheen, a real pioneer The trend continued in the post 9/11 era with TV shows like 24 and Homeland that brought the nasty caricature of Arabs and Muslims to living rooms all over the US. Shaheen's work was becoming increasingly important and he moved quickly to finish his most enduring publication. In Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People, Shaheen dissected 1,000 films produced over the last 25 years; he concluded that 936 of those films had portrayed their Arab and/or Muslim characters in a negative light. Shortly after I started working for Al Jazeera, I pitched a story about how celebrity diplomacy rarely ever applies to the Arab world (specifically on the question of Palestine ). I was delighted when my pitch was approved, and even happier when Shaheen invited me to his home in Hilton Head for a sit-down interview. I remember how excited I was as we pulled up to his driveway. He and his wife Bernice greeted us with smiles and open arms. Any nervousness I might have felt upon walking into his home was quickly overshadowed by his warmth and that smile that has touched so many people over the years. We chatted about all sorts of things while my cameraman set up the shot, and by the time we were ready to do the interview, I was completely at ease. The interview ended up being the longest one I've done so far in my 15 years as a journalist. His third book, Guilty: Hollywood's Verdict on Arabs after 9/11, had just been published the year before, so he had a lot to say. But I had many more questions to ask, questions that had very little to do with my assignment. He was full of wisdom and I wanted to take in as much of it as I possibly could. Challenge status-quo He told me that it's up to Arab Americans to challenge the status-quo in pop culture. "We don’t have a lobby in LA," he said back in 2009. "We have several Arab American and Muslim American lobbies in DC, but there are two centres of power in the world: Washington and Hollywood." Shaheen was a firm believer that the only way for Arabs and Muslims to rehabilitate our image on the big screen is for more of us to become part of the Hollywood machine. He agreed that much progress on that front has been made in recent years, but he also acknowledged that there's still a very long way for us to go. The last time we spoke was right before Donald Trump was elected president. I wanted to talk to him about what challenges still remained and how they might best be overcome. Although he was busy working on yet another project, he made the time for me yet again. Soon after news broke of his passing, I realised that I was not alone in feeling I had lost someone close to me. He had left a mark on so many of my friends and colleagues over the years, whether through the Jack G Shaheen Mass Communications Scholarship Award, or simply his warm and welcoming nature. His door was always open to us, and he will be sorely missed. SOURCE: Al Jazeera News ABOUT THE AUTHOR Karim Haddad Media US & Canada United States
RenderPagesVideo('5444783456001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); On June 9, Prannoy Roy stood at a lectern in front of a crowd of journalists at the Press Club of India in New Delhi. The journalists had gathered to protest against the recent raids on NDTV , India's oldest TV news channel, by the Central Bureau of Investigation. "They're trying to tell us we can suppress you even if you have done nothing wrong … and to be clear, that is a signal for the entire free press of India," he told his audience. Roy, who co-founded the channel with his wife Radhika, had seen their own home raided in an investigation into bank fraud charges which he dismissed as "ridiculous, concocted". The NDTV raids follow a busy year and a half for Indian free speech activists. In February, finance minister Arun Jaitley drew a sharp rebuke from liberal onlookers and critics of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) when he argued that freedom of expression should be subordinate to upholding the sovereignty of the country. WATCH: India's NDTV raid a 'defining moment' for press freedom - The Listening Post (9:27) Jaitley, speaking at the London School of Economics (LSE), had been asked to comment on the term "antinational", recently hurled at left-wing students during bloody clashes at Ramjas College in New Delhi. There, a two-day seminar had been derailed when members of the ABVP, a right-wing student group linked to the BJP, grew violent to mark their displeasure at some of the speakers in the programme. The ABVP objected particularly to the scheduled presence of left-wing student leader and PhD candidate Umar Khalid. A year earlier, Khalid had been branded "antinational" by political opponents and right-wing media personalities and had spent close to a month in jail after being arrested on colonial-era sedition charges for participating in an event commemorating the 2013 execution of Kashmiri separatist Afzal Guru . Attacks on free speech Khalid is clear: the government is "criminalising very normal political activity as seditious", he tells Al Jazeera. He is among the many activists, journalists, lawyers and academics who are concerned that threats to freedom of speech and the press have intensified since the BJP government of Narendra Modi took office, and that new forms of censorship are proliferating. In the 2017 World Press Freedom Index, India sank three places to position 136 ("least free"). The 2017 India Freedom Report, published in May by media watchdog The Hoot, spoke of "an overall sense of shrinking liberty not experienced in recent years". It counted 54 reported attacks on journalists, at least three cases of television news channels being banned, 45 internet shutdowns and 45 sedition cases against individuals and groups between January 2016 and April 2017. Chhattisgarh has been one of several major flashpoints. Arrests, death threats and even alleged torture of journalists, human rights activists and lawyers by agencies of the central Indian state created what a 2016 Amnesty International report called a "near total information blackout". The state is the epicentre of a decades-old Naxalite-Maoist insurgency and its security forces have a reputation for violent excess. Under the Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act, they also have broader powers of arrest than their counterparts in many other parts of India. READ MORE: India's Maoist rebels - An explainer Last year saw 29 internet shutdowns, compared to 15 in 2015. Many of these were instituted in Kashmir, where mobile internet services were suspended from July 9 after Burhan Wani, the 22-year-old commander of the Kashmiri separatist Hizbul Mujahideen group, was killed by Indian security forces. For many users, access was only restored in late January 2017. In October 2016, the Kashmir Reader , a prominent English-language newspaper, was asked to stop publication; it returned to newsstands in December. Meanwhile, The Hoot declared 2016 the year that "sedition went viral". The independent media monitor recorded 40 cases filed by the year's end - including those against Khalid and his fellow student-activists. On June 20 this year, 15 Muslim men were arrested and charged with sedition in Madhya Pradesh for cheering on Pakistan in a cricket match against India. The charges were dropped two days later. Always imperfect Some experts say a constriction of free speech is not unique to the Modi era. New Delhi-based political analyst and commentator Ashok Malik says that the threats to freedom of expression have been more or less constant since the 1950s. "The ecosystem that fosters freedom of expression in India has always been imperfect, from the beginning of the constitutional process," he tells Al Jazeera. "In India," he explains, "we have the right to free speech, but we don't have the right to offend." India encodes freedom of expression as a constitutional right under Article 19, though it is a heavily qualified prerogative. Laws classified in the constitution as "reasonable restrictions" to freedom of expression are numerous, broad in scope, and, according to a 2016 Human Rights Watch report, "prone to misuse". The low point for press freedom came in the 1970s during the Emergency, a 21-month period during which Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ruled by decree, imprisoned many of her political opponents and imposed draconian censorship standards on the news media. In 1989, the Rajiv Gandhi government banned Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses in response to protests by Muslims. Famously, in the 1990s and 2000s, painter MF Husain faced a battery of cases under laws against the promotion of enmity between religious groups, the outraging of religious feelings, the distribution of obscene materials and more. And after flying banners allegedly mocking the Indian constitution at a rally in 2012, political cartoonist Aseem Trivedi was briefly jailed on multiple charges related to insulting the state, including sedition. A polarised debate While restricted free speech is far from unprecedented in India, many observers describe a decline in the quality of the freedom of expression in India since Modi took office in 2014. The numbers on internet shutdowns and sedition cases don't tell the whole story: some analysts see the change most clearly manifested as a shift in the climate of debate. Maitreesh Ghatak, a professor of economics at the LSE who has written about freedom of speech, points to a trend of extreme polarisation in Indian political discourse in recent years. "What's really happening is that there's a certain angry mob mentality, especially on TV and digital media, that is drowning out certain kinds of discussions and making people unwilling to engage on certain topics," he says. Ghatak believes that political leaders have played a role in setting the tone for political discussion: "We can't avoid the fact that many of our leaders have said, on record, things that are provocative and divisive." READ MORE: The fall and rise of India's Yogi Adityanath Since 2014, Modi's BJP, a right-wing political party rooted in Hindutva, a term often translated as "Hindu nationalism" and which contains Hindu supremacist elements, has held power. Currently, the BJP is the most popular party in the country, ruling in 14 of India's 29 states. As popular as the BJP is, its religiously inflected brand of nationalism has raised concerns about government-backed sectarianism and low tolerance for dissent. Forms of censorship Satish Deshpande, a professor of sociology at the University of Delhi, thinks the government's failure to condemn violence has contributed to its normalisation and, in turn, an increase in self-censorship. "A climate of fear is created, which elicits a kind of voluntary censorship," he says. "There is evidence that this is happening in sections of the press and certainly in civil society." The latest World Press Freedom Index, too, noted that self-censorship is on the rise in Indian mainstream media. In the first half of 2017, 20 incidents of religiously inspired "cow-protection" lynchings were reported. The murders, targeting mostly Muslims, were met largely with silence by BJP leaders. After a Muslim man named Pehlu Khan was killed by Hindu vigilantes, Rajasthan's home minster Gulab Chand Kataria, a senior BJP figure, responded that the attackers had done "a good job by protecting cows from smuggling". He then went on to say: "But they have violated the law by beating people brutally." In June 2017, the murders, and the hushed response from leaders, prompted #NotInMyName , a series of protests against normalisation in cities around the country. BJP members have occasionally been directly linked to efforts to stifle free press and smear journalists. Union Minister for External Affairs VK Singh has repeatedly used the common online slur "presstitutes" to refer to journalists. Journalist Swati Chaturvedi, who wrote a book about her trolls, spoke to one former BJP "cyber-volunteer" who alleged that vicious trolling campaigns were directed by the party. Party spokespeople dismissed the account. Chinmayi Arun, who heads the Centre for Communication Governance at the National Law University Delhi, identifies the rise of "horizontal censorship of speech" - where censorship is not imposed "top-down", by the state, but by private entities - as yet another emerging trend. "There are very few legal safeguards against horizontal censorship of speech. So many people are silenced by trolls on social media acting in concert with each other," Arun told Al Jazeera over email. "Sometimes online platforms take down political speech, but the speaker has no recourse." READ MORE: Shot in the eyes - Kashmiri girl tells her story In the wake of Burhan Wani's death, Facebook took down dozens of posts and deleted accounts which addressed the situation in the Valley. In a statement, Facebook said there was "no room for content that praises or supports terrorists." Whipping up nationalism Meanwhile, some prominent media companies have swung towards an aggressively hyper-nationalist stance and an inflammatory style of broadcasting in recent years. Zee News, a popular Hindi and English language TV channel which has faced criticism for both its slant and standards, including for allegedly falsely captioning footage from the JNU protests that led to the arrests of student leaders, recently refused to cover an India-Pakistan cricket match. The boycott was announced by the media house's owner, Subhash Chandra, who in 2016 won a seat in India's Upper House with BJP support. Sevanti Ninan, founder-editor of The Hoot, notes that Times Now, a TV channel owned by the usually "pretty liberal" Times Group, seems to have adopted a jingoistic-patriotic stance to compete with the ratings earned by politically right-wing channels. "It's the style. You can't necessarily say that it's just a pro-BJP thing, but it's certainly in alignment with what the BJP does," Ninan told Al Jazeera. "It's about whipping up a sort of nationalism. Panels where a newscaster will shout at a guest, 'Are you an Indian?' We never had that before." But Ninan says India is simultaneously seeing a blossoming of new independent online media - some funded by civil society rather than owned by big media corporations - which tend to have a liberal leaning and are more balanced and objective. Among print media, she says, many remain independent. Above all, Ninan argues, India's media landscape is complex and fragmented - and this might offer cause for modest optimism. While English-language media have disproportionate influence in elite political discussion, their audiences account for a tiny fraction of India's whole. "Much of the country watches a channel in its own language, and what those do depends on the politics of that region; they're not reflecting BJP bias," she believes. "There are so many languages, and it's such a huge country. That's why there's freedom." In Umar Khalid's view, however, the landscape of freedom is deteriorating alarmingly quickly. He remembers hearing the term "antinational" for the first time - a slur hurled by right-wing student activists - around 2009. "We laughed at the absurdity of the entire thing," he says. A few years later, the word has mainstream political significance. "What the BJP has been successfully able to do," says Khalid, "is to make even the people opposing them speak their language."

Cape Town, South Africa - As a nine-year-old, Suna Venter used to plead with her mother to let her skip school so she could watch coverage of the first Iraq War on the news. "She was absolutely fascinated by the people on the fringes of the war, the children especially who were impacted by wars, and fascinated by the fact that this could be publicised, televised and so on," her father, Philip, remembers. Venter had found her calling: she was set on becoming a journalist. At the age of 24 Venter would go on to become a current affairs journalist and producer for the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), the state-owned public broadcaster. She reported from the front lines in Gaza , Libya and Syria. Venter's father says she was committed to her job, and to "good journalism - journalism with integrity," to the point of obsession. "We used to worry about her working too hard, but we would never have asked her to stop. She wouldn't have taken our advice in any case. The SABC was her life," he says. But Venter's passion for her work allegedly came to play a role in her sudden death at the end of June 2017, aged 32. According to veteran SABC journalist and media ombudsman George Claassens, Venter's death should be seen as a red flag signalling a growing onslaught against the country's journalists, as well as a reminder that South Africa's hard won media freedom , a pillar of its fledgling democracy, should "never be taken for granted". Broken Heart Syndrome Venter was suspended from the SABC in 2016 for disagreeing with orders to not cover anti-government and anti-media censorship protests that were taking place outside the SABC's offices in Cape Town. Within weeks, Venter and seven other SABC employees, who together came to be known as the SABC 8, had been sacked by the broadcaster for their public defiance of its policies - policies Classens says hark back to the apartheid era, when the SABC was "interfered with to the point where it was essentially the government mouthpiece" of the authoritarian and segregationist National Party. Venter and three of her SABC colleagues took their dismissal to South Africa's Labour Court, where it was ruled that they'd been unfairly and unlawfully dismissed and had to be reinstated. But Venter, seen as leading the charge against the SABC, soon began to receive anonymous death threats. Venter's family claim that her flat was broken into multiple times; the tyres on her car were slashed; she was allegedly assaulted on three separate occasions, shot at, and once even abducted. Foeta Krige, Venter's senior producer at SABC for eight years and another member of the SABC 8, remembers that Venter would often stay with him and his family because she was scared to be at her own home, where she lived alone. On one occasion, Krige says that Venter got into her car outside his house in the morning to find that her brake cables had been cut. Venter's father Philip says that during this period the family struggled to sleep at night: "We checked her Facebook every hour to see whether she was still alive. It was a scary and traumatic experience. I think the trauma that she experienced must have been absolutely devastating." Philip Venter says that this trauma undoubtedly contributed to his daughter being diagnosed with stress cardiomyopathy earlier this year. Also known as Broken Heart Syndrome, stress cardiomyopathy can cause rapid and severe heart muscle weakness. Philip Venter believes this condition ultimately claimed his daughter's life. SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kanyago maintains that while Suna Venter's passing was a "terrible loss", at no stage has the intimidation that she faced, nor her death, "been linked to the SABC." An environment of fear and intimidation Like Venter, Krige says he also received "about 13 or 14" death threats after the SABC 8 applied to South Africa's Constitutional Court to have the SABC's refusal to air protest footage declared unconstitutional in September 2016. He says he was labelled a "traitor" and a "liar" and that threats were also directed at his family. But Krige also describes an atmosphere of fear that went far beyond him and the other members of the SABC 8 and which he says infiltrated every echelon of the public broadcaster, particularly under the stewardship of former executive Hlaudi Motsoeneng. Motsoeneng's allegedly strong ties to South African President Jacob Zuma were once said by another SABC journalist, Lukhanyo Calata, to be an "open secret". Motsoeneng could not be reached for comment for this story, but has repeatedly denied such claims. According to Krige: "For such a long time, there was this absolute fear ... It's an atmosphere that I cannot describe to you. It's people standing in little corners, whispering, people avoiding eye contact, people who will stop talking when you pass them, people glancing at the roof to see if there are hidden microphones or cameras. It was really a toxic environment of fear and intimidation." Following an internal disciplinary hearing in June this year, Motsoeneng was found guilty of bringing the public broadcaster into disrepute and an interim board was appointed. SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago says: "The interim board wants to make absolutely sure that journalists are given the space to do their work freely. They are taking a very proactive approach to ensure that the working environment is good." But while Krige says that there have been improvements at the SABC within the past two months, he reiterates the widespread concerns in the South African media industry that there is an increasingly "orchestrated effort" to intimidate local journalists, and that this extends far beyond the public broadcaster. Hired thugs? Krige's assertion has been most brazenly illustrated by the role of radical activist group Black First Land First (BLF), who have been responsible for a number of acts of harassment and intimidation against journalists who they claim are intentionally perpetuating racist media agendas through selective coverage. This came to a head on the day of Venter's death, when the BLF picketed outside the private residence of Peter Bruce, a columnist for Business Day newspaper and editor-at-large of Tiso Blackstar, a major South African private media corporation. South African political journalist Karima Brown, a former colleague of Bruce's when she was political editor at Business Day, says that she was physically assaulted and threatened by a female member of BLF when she arrived at Bruce's house to contest the picket; she has since laid charges against the alleged assailant. More recently on Monday, July 17, investigative journalist Micah Reddy also gave a statement describing how he'd been assaulted by members of BLF after a televised panel debate on fake news at Shine Studios in Johannesburg. On July 27, the BLF disrupted a Johannesburg town hall event hosted by the amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism, where Reddy is employed. A statement on amaBhungane's website the following day said that BLF "physically threatened participants and members of the public". BLF spokesperson Zanele Lwana dismissed such claims, telling Al Jazeera: "The BLF does not promote racism, intimidation, harassment, assault against anyone. That is not the conduct of our movement." However, referring to the alleged incidents involving Reddy and Brown, she added: "You cannot provoke us and create situations where there is going to be an altercation, then when we respond to your insults you go and cry to the media." Brown says BLF's members are "hired thugs" who enjoy political support from "the highest office in the land," while chair of the South African National Editors' Forum (SANEF), Mahlatse Gallens, points out that BLF has specifically targeted editors from publications that have exposed high-level government corruption. Although the ruling African National Congress (ANC) declined to comment on Brown's and Gallens' claims for this article despite repeated requests, at a communications briefing during the ANC National Policy Conference on July 5, Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu condemned the actions of BLF against journalists. He added that the ANC has always fought for media freedom and will continue to do so. Brown, however, argues that although the ruling party made "a big song and dance of coming out in support of us and condemning the BLF, the president in whose name this is being done has said nothing". Lwana denies that there is any direct government support for BLF, but a number of recent articles in the South African press have also linked the group to the controversial Gupta family, Indian expatriate business tycoons who enjoy a favourable relationship with Jacob Zuma and some other members of parliament. The Guptas have been mired in corruption scandals since a series of hundreds of thousands of emails was leaked to South African media outlets including the amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism, as well as Media24 and the Daily Maverick. Branko Brkic, editor of the Daily Maverick, says that he had beefed up armed security at the popular news site's Cape Town offices after it received the leaked emails. Such measures are not isolated. In April, Sunday Times investigative journalist Mzilikazi wa Afrika and his family were put under 24-hour protection after the paper received what it called "credible information" that wa Afrika's life was in imminent danger due to his coverage of apparent corruption at the parastatal energy provider, Eskom. City Press investigative journalist Sipho Masondo and his family experienced similar threats following his investigations into corruption at the Department of Water and Sanitation. Masondo says he declined a total of 3.5 million rand (more than $250,000) offered to him in bribes by representatives of the department to drop his investigation. The creeping threat of authoritarianism For wa Afrika, who has won more than 20 awards for his investigative journalism over almost as many years, the death threats are nothing new. But he believes the overall threat to journalists in South Africa is "undoubtedly getting worse," and he points to the correlation with some members of parliament who have also been receiving death threats for speaking out against the Zuma faction of an increasingly fragmented and controversy-laden ANC. Prominent media commentator and columnist Eusebius McKaiser shares wa Afrika's belief in the overlap between increasing contestation in South African political arenas and encroachments on journalists and media freedom. "These attempts to undermine journalists ... it's all part of the factional battles inside the ANC in the first instance and then in society at large. It is a battle for resources and journalists are seen as a threat to those who wish to loot, and that's really the motive behind it," McKaiser says. He adds that encroachments on media freedom should be seen as a serious risk to the overall health of South Africa's fledgling democracy. "Where authoritarian society starts they come first for radio stations, then for the rest of the media, and then you have the average Joe, civil and political, and socio economic rights being trampled on." Gallens echoes McKaiser's sense that the current encroachment on media freedom is part of a wider onslaught against crucial democratic institutions in South Africa . "We know the painful past that we come from in terms of apartheid," Gallens says, "and the vision going forward was that we needed these kinds of institutions to hold those in authority accountable. In response to the work that these democratic institutions are doing, those that are on the wrong side have now taken to denigrating and attacking [them]." The ANC did not respond to multiple requests from Al Jazeera for comment on this. South Africa has long been viewed as a shining example of a robust free press; the role journalists played in opening up some of the cracks in the authoritarian apartheid regime is well documented. But the country has slumped in press freedom indexes in the past few years. The death of Suna Venter has come to serve as a symbol of the human cost of this new trend. But although her father Philip is acutely aware of this, he says the family doesn't want to waste its energy apportioning blame or harbouring anger. They'd rather focus on the positives. "Nothing ever came between us as a family, not at all," he remembers. "In fact, just this morning my wife and I told each other we're so glad we supported [Suna] all the time in everything she did. How would we have felt today if we hadn't done that?" SOURCE: Al Jazeera News ABOUT THE AUTHOR Christopher Clark Christopher Clark is a British freelance journalist based in Cape Town.

People in several Indian cities held candlelights to pay tribute to the 55-year-old editor [Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty Images] Gauri Lankesh, an Indian journalist, publisher and outspoken critic of right-wing groups, was shot dead by unknown attackers in front of her home in the southern city of Bangalore on Tuesday. She was 55. "The fact that she was so vocal made her a prime target," Sudipto Mondal, a Bangalore-based journalist based in Bangalore, told Al Jazeera. " And I suppose that goes for a lot of people over here, which is why there are fears that other people might be in the line." The news of Lankesh's killing met shock and outrage, with journalists, civil society members and students across the country sharply condemning the murder. "Gauri Lankesh was a known critic of the central government on key issues and had fearlessly expressed her views in the newspaper she edited, as well as in other forums," the Editors Guild of India said in a statement. "Her killing is an ominous portent for dissent in democracy and a brutal assault on the freedom of the press." why do i feel that some of `us' are fighting between ourselves? we all know our ``biggest enemy''. can we all please concentrate on that? — Gauri Lankesh (@gaurilankesh) September 4, 2017 // <![CDATA[ // ]]]] > Several groups, including the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), demanded a thorough investigation into the killing. "India needs to address the problem of impunity in journalist murders and ensure the press can work freely," Steven Butler, CPJ Asia Program Coordinator, said from Washington, DC. On Wednesday, people in several Indian cities held candlelight vigils to pay tribute to Lankesh, while h undreds of mourners, including Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, attended her state funeral in Bangalore, the hub of India's IT industry. Lankesh was buried with full state honours at a cemetery in Bangalore [Nivedita Bhattacharjee/Reuters] A Special Investigating Team was tasked with probing Lankesh's murder, which came more than two years after the killing of rationalist MM Kalburgi, a former vice chancellor of Hampi University, in a similar attack. The investigation into his death has still not been concluded. "There have been attacks on writers and thinkers in the recent past, particularly since the ascendancy of Mr [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi. There has been murder of rationalist [Narendra] Dabholkar in Pune, [Govind] Pansare, a left party worker in south Maharashtra [state], Dr Kalburgi in Karnataka's Dharwad, where I currently live," Ganesh Devy, a prominent linguist and a novelist, told Al Jazeera by phone. "These were people who objectively presented the picture of the society. They were eliminated because [the] right wing did not like their rationality and objectivity," he added. In Dharwad, about 400km north of Bangalore, some 3,000 young people staged a rally in Lankesh's memory, while all colleges and universities remained closed, according to Devy. "This has not happened before. The death of journalist has never received this kind of response," he said.

Hours before being killed, she had posted a message on her Facebook page condemning the planned deportation of Rohingya refugees by the Indian government. Devy said she was "the most fearless and outspoken crusader for the marginal people". Assassination is the most extreme form of censorship. #GauriLankesh said things some people did not like2hear.

She initially wanted to become a doctor, but later on decided to follow in the footsteps of her father. Lankesh started her journalistic career with English newspaper Times of India. She took over her father's newspaper after his death in 2000 but started her own weekly publication, Gauri Lankesh Patrike (GLP) in 2005 following a feud with her brother. The GLP did not accept advertisements and ran based on individual subscriptions. Let's not forget she could have landed any job she wanted; she was that good of a journalist. She could have been a senior editor at a mainstream English [language] newspaper. But she chose not to do that. Sudipto Mondal, journalist Its anti-establishment views struck a chord with many readers, but also drew the ire of right-wing political forces, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which runs the federal government. "Let's not forget she could have landed any job she wanted; she was that good of a journalist," said Mondal. "She could have been a senior editor at a mainstream English [language] newspaper. But she chose not to do that. She chose to work with a small Kannada publication. She taught herself how to write Kannada, as she did not start as a Kannada journalist." Journalists and civil society members across the country protested Lankesh's murder [Rupak De Chowdhuri/Reuters] Those close to Lankesh said her views on caste structure, as well as her active support for minorities, had angered far-right Hindu groups. "In the present atmosphere of intimidation of writers, threats received by them all the time on Twitter, Facebook and mobile [phones], she espoused the cause of full expression," Devy said. Last November, Lankesh was convicted in a defamation case brought by BJP leaders. She was granted bail the same day. "I oppose the caste system of the 'Hindu Dharma', which is unfair, unjust and gender-biased," she had said in an interview last year. Lankesh's death has raised fears over free speech and the right to dissent in India, where far-right Hindu groups have previously attacked people with secular views. "These are times of great arguments over the idea of India. The Hindu right is on the one side and the forces who are opposed to the Hindu right are caught up in bitter acrimonious arguments," Mondal, who knew Gauri since 2004, said. "She was like a glue who would have been able to bring different factions together. And with her gone, the task of fighting the right-wing has become that much more difficult." #GauriLankeshMurder Kill those you can't silence..Hope people understand what's going on in the country. @bhatia_niraj23 @rkhuria @gops333 pic.twitter.com/Y8vmKGk3dS — Rajiv (@Rajivmehra27) September 6, 2017 // <![CDATA[ // ]]]] > The killing also sent a shockwave through the journalism industry in the world's largest democracy, where media has been accused of "self-censorship". "Definitely, it is a blow to freedom of press. I do not think Gauri Lankesh should be confused with regular mainstream press, which is pliant and tends to self-censure," said Mondal. "Journalists like her are often dismissed as activists, which is unfortunate. These are people, who take an open political stand."

A supporter of opposition leader Raila Odinga gestures in front of burned barricade in Kibera slum in Nairobi, Kenya [Goran Tomasevic/Reuters] It has been a little more than a week since Kenyans took to the ballot to elect their representatives and leaders for the next five years. On Friday evening, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission declared President Uhuru Kenyatta the winner of the presidential race. Friday night ushered a tense weekend of protests and riots, particularly in the opposition strongholds. Media reports were scant and left many yearning for updates. As the weekend wore on, it became clear that all was not well in Kenya . The opposition coalition, in a press statement on Saturday, claimed that 100 people had been killed by police officers in the post election violence , while the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights placed the number at 24 .

Some social media users were providing blow-by-blow updates of events taking place around them, with others amplifying those reports, providing alternative or supplementary commentary. The majority of the reports coming from Nairobi slums of Kibera and Mathare, the city of Kisumu and other opposition stronghold areas were painting a grim picture. However, the Kenya Red Cross Secretary General, Abbas Gullett, in an interview on Monday, drew attention to an increase in the number of "fake news" making rounds on social media over the weekend. He classified graphic footage and images that were being spread on Twitter , Facebook and WhatsApp throughout the weekend as "misinformation" aimed at "creating further tension in the country". He announced that over the weekend his organisation helped more than 100 people injured as a result of the post-election violence across the country, but dismissed social media reports about night-time attacks in opposition strongholds. He said widely shared stories about the "mayhem" in Nairobi's Mathare slum on Sunday night were fake, explaining that "they did not receive any distress calls from the area." His statement elicited angry reactions from the public, as it was perceived to be dismissive of what many were experiencing first hand and reporting. READ MORE: Kenyatta to Odinga supporters - Take complaints to court It cannot be dismissed that there were violent confrontations between the police and protesters, which resulted in multiple deaths and injuries, following the announcement of the election result. And some of this post-election violence was not adequately covered by traditional media organisations. However, we now know that some of the pictures disseminated on popular Kenyan social media accounts over the weekend that allegedly showed police brutality towards protesters were fake. So, what constituted fake news, and what didn't? And why were these falsities so common in Kenya during this election season?

Facebook , WhatsApp and Twitter are perhaps the three most popular social media platforms in Kenya, and have been used to share opinions, predictions and fabrications alike before and after the election. There have been websites as well, designed to give the impression that they are authoritative sources of news, that have carried all sorts of (mis)information and propaganda. As has been widely reported, fake news articles and videos bearing CNN, BBC and even NTV Kenya logos were also disseminated and shared widely on social media platforms. Now, anyone who has an internet connection can tell their story, their version of events, and connect with audiences that may be inclined to (dis)agree with them. By doing so they create debate and even create consensus. All in all, it has been a controversial election season in Kenya, in which distinguishing truth from lie and real information from "fake news" has been difficult. Misinformation and propaganda around elections are not new in Kenya, as these tools have most certainly been used to influence voters in past elections. However, this election season has seen these migrate to popular social media platforms, to either play at existing beliefs, fears and biases, or to sway perceptions and even votes on August 8. Social media is the go-to platform for information for young people, who constituted more than half of the 19.6 million registered Kenyan voters this election. These young people do not necessarily tune into prime time news on television, for instance, as they operate in a real-time news dissemination system, in which they tune in and out, and select what to consume and when, as they deem fit. It is, therefore, not surprising that Kenyan social media was filled with misinformation and fake news, aiming to alter these young voters' perceptions, views and actions both before and after the general election. There are a number of issues, in the Kenyan context, as with elsewhere, that give fake news breeding ground. Chief among them, in my view, is the changing tides of information dissemination in the country. In the past, the government, mainstream media and civil society were the primary sources of information in Kenya. These institutions, as they are liable for the accuracy of the information that they disseminate, acted as a barrier for fake news stories. However, now, anyone who has an internet connection can tell their story, their version of events, and connect with audiences that may be inclined to (dis)agree with them. By doing so they create debate or consensus. For those who may have felt excluded in narratives put forth by the "traditional estates" of society in the past, these online platforms offer an avenue to be heard and counted, and even alter the narratives presented in mainstream media outlets. REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: Why are Kenya's elections so bitterly contested? But these people, who now have a chance to influence thousands of people online, are not liable for the accuracy of the information that they put forward. They can purposefully spread false information or "fake news" to alter the public's opinion on a certain issue, or at least share their own, biased version of the truth. And they can do this with impunity. Kenya has a history of discrimination against certain communities and the country is still riddled with injustices that remain unaddressed or suppressed. Social media platforms allow Kenyans to voice their grievances about these issues, but these same channels also provide an avenue for dissemination of fake news. On these platforms, dangerous exaggerations and falsities go hand in hand with facts and truths. Also, people's perceptions and experiences alter what they consider to be truthful, making it even harder to pinpoint what is indeed "fake news" and what is not. Tackling fake news The widely cited survey, The Reality of Fake News in Kenya ( PDF ) by GeoPoll and Portland Communications offers a useful starting point to better understand what is perceived as "fake news" in Kenya. Defining fake news as the "deliberate spreading of false information", the study found that 87 percent of respondents had seen information regarding the election they suspected was "deliberately false". The respondents also noted that social media was the main platform on which they encountered such information.

(25:00) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY A majority of respondents also expressed their desire to find credible news sources, perhaps as an antidote to the propaganda and "fake news" that has swept through the Kenyan information landscape online. In a bid to address the epidemic of fake news and misinformation this election season, the Communications Authority of Kenya and the National Cohesion and Integration Commission issued guidelines that stated that "undesirable political content" would need to be taken down within 24 hours of being notified from any platform hosting such content. Yet, there have been no noted takedowns as per the guidelines so far. This approach could also be a game of whack-a-mole, as the taking down of such content on one platform wouldn't prevent it from being disseminated through other, hard to control platforms, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. Even as we move past the election season, it is to be expected that misinformation will continue to manifest. It is not sufficient to decry "fake news" and blame social media as the sole culprit. As well as assessing what constitutes "fake news", we need to understand why fake news appeals to Kenyans at this point in time and we need to have an honest discussion about the failures of traditional news sources. Only then can we tame the Kenyans appetite for "fake news".

Two man comfort each other at a late night vigil for those injured in a car attack on counter protesters after the "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia [Jim Bourg/Reuters] On January 29, Fox News republished a post from conservative mouthpiece the Daily Caller (which was originally founded by Fox News host Tucker Carlson) that contained a jocular "highlight reel" of video clips showing vehicles hitting protesters. The accompanying commentary from writer Mike Raust read, "Here's a compilation of liberal protesters getting pushed out of the way by cars and trucks. Study the technique; it may prove useful in the next four years." During that same month, and seemingly inspired by the Dakota Access Pipeline protests at Standing Rock, North Dakota state representative Keith Kempenich from the Republican Party proposed legislation that would waive a motorist's liability for any damages caused by striking any person who was "obstructing vehicular traffic on a public road, street, or highway", including injury or death. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5545647008001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5545647008001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > THE LISTENING POST: Charlottesville: White supremacy and the White House (25:44) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Legislators from multiple states, including North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Rhode Island, and Florida followed suit with similar bills aimed at limiting the liability of any motorist who hits protesters with their vehicle - as long as said motorist is exercising "due care". While most of these bills failed, North Carolina's passed 67-to-48, and is currently waiting for action in the state senate. As the criminalisation of dissent continues apace under the Trump regime, it's almost unsurprising to see this level of animus directed at dissenters, even who chose to protest peacefully - but it's still shocking. The effect that this outpouring of government, media , and presidential aggression towards protesters has had on the way the public perceives them has yet to be fully understood, but it's no real stretch of the imagination to opine that it hasn't exactly helped. The Fox News post remained live until three days after a white supremacist terrorist rammed his car into a crowd of peaceful protesters in Charlottesville, injuring 19 and killing 32-year-old paralegal Heather Heyer. At that point, both Fox News and the Daily Caller quietly removed the video, and Fox News released a statement from Noah Kotch, the editor-in-chief of Fox News Digital, saying, "The item was inappropriate and we've taken it down. We regret posting it in January." READ MORE: Charlottesville - Witnessing the 'monstrous' attack But, as has become all too apparent, the damage had already been done. The "technique" that so thrilled Mike Raust and that has been used by terrorists across Europe , the UK, and the Middle East has now become a signature move of American white supremacist terrorists - like the one who attempted to mow down a crowd of protesters in in the city of Vancouver, Washington state, this past weekend. With US flags hanging from the sides of his black Chevy Silverado and a Confederate flag sticker proudly affixed to his back window, the driver allegedly put his vehicle in reverse and accelerated towards the protesters, who had gathered to protest a rally by the right-wing group, Patriot Prayer. Witnesses say he then circled the block to confront the angry crowd again, cutting the marchers off. According to local media, Vancouver police initially arrested the driver, but eventually released him without charges. What happened in Charlottesville sent shockwaves through the nation, but James Alex Fields' shocking act of hatred was not the first time that a political extremist had used a car as a weapon on American soil - and as the attempted Vancouver attack shows, it won't be the last, not until legislators and the media take responsibility for their role in the perpetuation of this horrific 'technique'. Following the charged protests at Berkeley earlier this month, the media latched onto a video shot by Mother Jones journalist Shane Bauer, in which several Antifa activists appear to assault a man on the right-wing side. Many outlets ignored the rest of his reporting and any attempts to contextualise the event, instead zeroing in on the violence. They readily took the opportunity to paint Antifa activists - who'd received a substantial amount of positive press following Cornel West's comments on their actions in Charlottesville - as an unruly menace. But now that an attempted copycat attack from another white terrorist was narrowly avoided, where is the outrage? Where are the front-page headlines, the op-eds, the cable TV segments? Where is the Tucker Carlson interview with survivors of the Vancouver protest? Save for several write-ups by local news outlets and a mention at the tail end of a Washington Post article, there's been next to nothing. Salon, the Portland Mercury and the Guardian published pieces later on Monday, but the coverage is a mere dribble compared with the floods of negative pieces on the Antifa that have become the norm. The same media outlets who delight in publishing endless depictions of left-wing violence owe it to their readership to do the same when the right wing lashes out. Legislators need to speak out and stand up for their constituents, regardless of party affiliation or lack thereof. The president should roundly condemn right-wing terrorist violence (though given his tepid, divisive response to Charlottesville, perhaps it's best he stays mum). Now is the time for Fox News and the Daily Caller to issue a strong, definitive apology for posting the inflammatory, anti-protester footage, to disavow this attack, and to take responsibility for the anti-protester sentiment they've encouraged. Their silence is deafening, especially as it comes from a source that will trip over itself to howl "all lives matter" whenever a black or brown person asserts their right to exist. The message that's being conveyed right now is that all lives matter - as long as they voted for Trump. What happened in Charlottesville sent shockwaves through the nation, but James Alex Fields ' shocking act of hatred was not the first time that a political extremist had used a car as a weapon on US soil - and as the attempted Vancouver attack shows, it won't be the last, not until legislators and the media take responsibility for their role in the perpetuation of this horrific "technique". The Trump Administration made it crystal clear how it feels about dissenting voices quite early on, kicking off its reign with the mass arrest of over 200 J20 protesters at his inauguration and following up with a prolonged war on the free press. Trump's goal is universal adoration - and barring that, the silencing of those who refuse to toe the party line. Those in government and the media who support this madness through inflammatory rhetoric, misleading news stories and anti-protester legislation must be held accountable. They have Heather Heyer 's blood on their hands, and it's not going to wash off easily.

The New York Times today is integral to a massive Islamophobic machinery that marks Islam and Muslim as the diabolic enemy of all manners and claims to a civilized life, writes Dabashi [Reuters] A spectre is haunting Hollywood - the spectre of a sexual predator named Harvey Weinstein. All the powers of liberal elite have gathered their forces to exorcise this infamy. From New York Times and the New Yorker to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences down to every website and tabloid from coast to coast. What they could not do to Donald Trump now they are determined to do to Harvey Weinstein with a vengeance: Scandalise and run him out of town, as if he were an effigy of Donald Trump. In October 2017, The New York Times and The New Yorker came out with two bombshell exposes that dozens of women in the film industry had accused Harvey Weinstein, a prominent film producer, of sexual harassment, sexual assault and even rape. Scores of other prominent actors - including Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, and Mira Sorvino - subsequently came forward and accused Weinstein of such abusive behaviours. Weinstein, however, denied "any non-consensual sex", as his wife announced she was divorcing him. Weinstein was soon fired from the company he cofounded and expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. But still the key question persisted, how could such abuses go on for decades without being exposed. 'Harvey Weinstein of Islam?' In the middle of this traumatic event, in which the world outside Hollywood is coming to terms with the horrid fact of sexual abuse in the film industry, the appearance of a bizarre article in the New York Times with the title of "Could this be the Harvey Weinstein of Islam?" was jarring and outlandish, even for the New York Times. The piece, penned by a notorious Ayaan Hirsi Ali wannabe, tells its readers: "An activist in France leveled rape allegations against the grandson of the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood on Friday." We read the piece and we learn that a young Muslim woman in Paris, Henda Ayari , had written a book in French , J'ai choisi d'etre libre (I chose to be free), in which she had described how she was the subject of a sexual assault by a Muslim man, but had kept his identity anonymous. But with "the #MeToo hashtag ricocheting around the globe, as women worldwide shared their experiences of sexual harassment and assault, Ayari found new courage" and in a Facebook post declared: "It is a very difficult decision but I too have decided it is time to denounce my attacker. It is Tariq Ramadan." No amount of sexual violence by Muslim men, no matter how 'prominent' they may think they are, amounts to the astoundingly racist headline of 'the Harvey Weinstein of Islam' - as indeed Harvey Weinstein himself being a Jew has absolutely nothing to do with the noble, civilizing, and the enduring moral rectitude of Judaism. The key question is not the actual content of this piece of news - for if indeed, as Ms Ayari alleges, a weak and vulnerable woman has been subjected to unwanted sexual advances and coerced into an abusive relationship against her will, then the matter must be exposed, denounced, and taken to any legal court if the victim so chooses, and the perpetrator ostracised and shamed. There is no discounting, dismissing, belittling, or sidestepping an allegation of such gravity. But the issue is not the substance of such allegations. Sexual violence is a global and transcultural malady and needs the global attention it now receives. Among the 1.6 billion Muslims around the world, no doubt Muslim men (like all other men) have their share of despicable sexual violence that needs to be exposed and addressed. But no amount of sexual violence by Muslim men, no matter how "prominent" they may think they are, amounts to the astoundingly racist headline of "the Harvey Weinstein of Islam" - as indeed Harvey Weinstein himself being a Jew has absolutely nothing to do with the noble, civilising, and the enduring moral rectitude of Judaism. How is that so? Allow me to explain. Islam as a metaphor of evil {articleGUID} Did anyone call Harvey Weinstein "the monster of Judaism?" No - because his criminal monstrosity has nothing to do with Judaism . Did anyone call the other sexual predator Americans have freely and democratically elected as their president "the Harvey Weinstein of Christianity"? No - because Donald Trump's shenanigans have nothing to do with Christianity . Muslim women are systematically raped and murdered in Myanmar - has anyone ever uttered the term "Harvey Weinstein of Buddhism"? There are plenty of rapists in India - we have never read the New York Times calling them "Harvey Weinstein of Hinduism" - and rightly so. Why then should the New York Times fish around the world for one alleged case of sexual violence presumably perpetrated by a Muslim and call it "Harvey Weinstein of Islam". Tariq Ramadan is indeed known mostly in Europe as a prominent Muslim, the grandson of another prominent Muslim - but no Muslim, no matter how prominent he might be, represents Islam . There are high-ranking Christian priests accused and even convicted of sexual abuse of children. There are Jewish rabbis calling for the wholesale massacre of Palestinians. There are power monger Shia clerics running a vicious theocracy in Iran . There are Sunni mass murderers roaming in Iraq and Syria. There are Buddhist monks slaughtering Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. But none of these atrocities can or should be declared as an indication of the categorical moral depravity of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism or Hinduism. A Muslim, a Jew, a Christian, a Buddhist, a Hindu is a fallible human being. Islam, Judaism, Christianity, etc are abstract sacred orders, normative moral universes, definitive to the ethical intuition of our senses of the sublime and the truthful. The history of our humanity is ravaged by the moral depravity of all of us of whatever denomination we might be. But if against all odds we can still stand erect and tally any measure of truth to our existence it is precisely because the best and the sublimest in our self-transcendence have been summoned in these sacred orders. {articleGUID} But today it is only Islam, and it is only in the United States , Europe, and Israel - the epicentre of white supremacist racism - that has been successfully and totally transformed into a singular signal of an unrelenting evil that needs to be eradicated. The New York Times today is integral to a massive Islamophobic machinery that marks Islam and Muslim as the diabolic enemy of history, of humanity, and of all manners and claims to a civilized life. If something like the Harvey Weinstein scandal has absolutely nothing to do with Muslims and Islam, they will find a pernicious way to find one case of alleged Muslim sexual violence and pin it down not on him as a person, a Muslim, a scholar, but on the entirety of "Islam" itself. The target of this vicious Islamophobia is not just individual Muslims. It is against Islam itself. It aims to rob Muslims of the very fabric of their humanity, debone their moral rectitude to nullity - either to die under Bush, Obama, and Trump bombs from one end of the Muslim world to another or else convert to a "Judeo-Christian" creed and be saved and civilised.

In this June 26, 2009 file photo a BBC Persian service presenter gets ready to present the news, at the corporation's London headquarters [Simon Dawson/AP] On October 25, the BBC sent an official complaint to the United Nations over the persecution which the staff of its Persian service face in Iran . A criminal investigation has been launched against 152 former and current BBC staff for "conspiracy against national security". In August, a court ordered the freezing of assets of the 152 individuals and their families. The Iranian authorities have harassed, insulted and intimidated staff of the BBC Persian service for almost 40 years, often accused of being spies for the British government. This sustained campaign has no justification whatsoever in the present day but its roots could be traced in the role that the BBC used to play as a propaganda tool during World War II and the early days of the Cold War. Documents of the British Foreign Office reveal how in December 1940 when BBC's Persian radio first came on air they were part of the British strategy to counter Nazi propaganda. The broadcasts in Persian included texts written by the British intelligence directly targeting the then shah of Iran, Reza Pahlavi, who was suspected of supporting Adolf Hitler's expansionist plans in Asia . The broadcasts which are said to have led to the downfall of Reza Shah criticised his "dictatorial" methods and advocated republicanism. "His Majesty's Government now agreed that the BBC might begin to give various broadcasts in Persian which had been prepared beforehand, starting with talks on Constitutional Government and increasing in strength and colour until all Reza Shah's mismanagement, greed and cruelty were displayed to the public gaze," one document stated. Moreover, in the late 1940s and early 1950s when the diplomatic crisis over the nationalisation of Iranian oil came to a head, BBC Persian broadcasts were used to discredit the popular prime minister of Iran, Mohammad Mossadeq. In March 1951, when the nationalisation was carried out, he was portrayed as "a misguided and often purblind patriot whose distinct demagogy, his single-minded obstinacy and his total lack of construction ideas" had caused the crisis. {articleGUID} Those episodes had a lasting impact on the collective memory of Iranians towards the BBC Persian. But two points should be noted here: First, that the Islamic Republic has no affinity with either Reza Shah or Dr Mossadeq. Second, in the decades following the Mossadeq affair, the BBC gradually changed and by the time the popular uprising against Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi started in 1978, it was looking to cover events in the country objectively. Today, the conspiracy theorists in Iran, led by the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, still regard the BBC as an instrument of British political machinations "The lie-broadcasting BBC channel funded by English intelligence services is aiming to interfere in Iran's internal affairs and this requires vigilance of the revolutionary forces," said the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) when BBC Persian TV went on air. However, the authorities have conveniently forgotten that it was the BBC Persian broadcasts during the two years prior to the Iranian revolution of 1979 that first aired their demands from the shah's regime. They have forgotten how they benefitted from BBC's independent reporting when despite mounting pressure from both Iran and the UK governments not to air an interview with the leader of the revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the BBC decided to go ahead with it. For that reason, the shah called the BBC his "number one enemy" in the final months of 1978, demanding the Foreign Office to close the section down. Archive documents have revealed that the complaints were transmitted by Sir Anthony Parsons, the then UK Ambassador in Iran, who argued that the broadcasts had enraged the shah "an important British friend in the region". {articleGUID} The BBC remained adamant that its reporting on the revolution must continue. Several prominent supporters of the shah presiding in the UK bombarded the BBC with complaints. The Persian service became a highly debated topic in the Foreign Office with many agreeing with Parsons that the service should be closed and others including the then Foreign Secretary, David Owen, saying the BBC should be allowed to operate independently. The latter argued that the long-term interests of Britain lay in allowing the BBC to be independent and trusted as a world broadcaster. Since the Iranian revolution, the BBC has had difficulty sustaining an office in Iran and keeping its Iranian staff out of harm's way. It has complained of harassment to the authorities on several occasions but without any result. Since the protests of 2009, which the BBC covered extensively, harassment against its staff has increased exponentially. The complaint the network filed with the UN details "multiple ongoing infringements of the BBC Persian staff's right to freedom of opinion, movement and expression". It also states that measures being imposed on its staff and their families potentially "engage a wide range of rights under general international law and international human rights". It documents several cases of harassment of its staff such as how the sister of a journalist was held in Evin prison for 17 days and forced to plead with the journalist via Skype to stop working for the BBC or spy on colleagues. There's also evidence of how elderly parents of the journalists have been interrogated and questioned at night. The most common form of harassment involves the confiscation of passports on arrival, call for interrogation and then accusations and inflammatory fabricated stories in the hardline press. It is clear that the staff of the BBC Persian are being punished for exposing inconvenient truths in Iran, where the repressive regime continues to stifle freedom of expression. Journalism is not a crime and the authorities in Iran should not use journalists as pawns to settle political scores against Britain.

Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based media network, marks its 21st anniversary on Wednesday, amid calls by Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt for its closure. This year's anniversary comes as Mahmoud Hussein, one of the network's journalists remains in an Egyptian jail for over 300 days . Hussein, an Egyptian national based in Qatar , was detained while on holiday in December 2016. He was accused of "incitement against state institutions and broadcasting false news with the aim of spreading chaos". Al Jazeera has rejected all the accusations against him and calls for his immediate release. A number of human rights and press freedom groups have joined Al Jazeera in condemning Mahmoud's ongoing detention. 'Al Jazeera cannot be shut down' Hussein's detention was the latest in a string of arrests by authorities in Egypt and elsewhere, targeting the network's staff . In fact, throughout the past two decades, Al Jazeera and its journalists have repeatedly come under attack for covering news stories as they unfolded. {articleGUID} Its offices have occasionally been bombed or shut down in many places, including in Kabul, Baghdad and Gaza . Reporters have been killed covering war zones in Iraq , Syria and Libya, while others have been jailed or forced to leave their countries following death threats. "This newsroom has transformed the media landscape the world over - but it's come at a price," Giles Trendle, Al Jazeera English managing director, said from the Qatari capital of Doha on the network's 21st anniversary. "Many of the journalists here have friends or colleagues who have sacrificed a great deal for the sake of what they consider to be sacrosanct: the right of people to be informed," he added. "Regardless of the continued campaigns against Al Jazeera as a network, Al Jazeera as an idea cannot be shut down." 'Changed idea of free speech in the region' In June, Saudi Arabia, the UAE , Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar and imposed a land, sea and air embargo, accusing it of supporting "terrorism". Doha has repeatedly denied the allegation. One of the Saudi-led group's demands, in order to lift the blockade, is the shutting down of Al Jazeera. {articleGUID} Doha has rejected that demand, insisting that it is the duty of governments to protect basic human rights as enshrined in the Geneva Convention, including the right to information. "When you tell me to close a channel like Al Jazeera, history will write one day in 50, 60 or 70 years how it changed the whole idea of free speech in the region," Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani said in a recent interview with CBS' 60 Minutes, while reiterating that the fate of the network was not up for discussion. Media outlets and press freedom groups, including The Committee to Protect Journalists, Human Rights Watch, Reporters Without Borders, the New York Times editorial board and The Guardian, have all condemned the efforts to pressure Qatar into shutting down Al Jazeera.

Nasser Al-Khelaifi and beIN Media denied any wrongdoing, saying they will fully cooperate with authorities [Jacky Naegelen/Reuters] beIN Media Group has refuted all accusations of corruption by Swiss prosecutors examining the sale of World Cup media rights. On Thursday, the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland (OAG) opened a corruption investigation against the chief executive officer of beIN Media Group and a former secretary-general of FIFA. beIN CEO Nasser Al-Khelaifi and former FIFA executive Jerome Valcke are suspected of bribery, fraud, criminal mismanagement and forgery of a document, the OAG said in a statement on Thursday. "It is suspected that Jerome Valcke accepted undue advantages from a businessman in the sports rights sector in connection with the award of media rights for certain countries at the FIFA World Cups in 2018, 2022, 2026 and 2030 and from Nasser Al-Khelaifi in connection with the award of media rights for certain countries at the FIFA World Cups in 2026 and 2030," the OAG statement said. In addition to heading up beIN, Khelaifi is also chairman and CEO of Paris Saint-Germain Football Club in France. Prosecutors indicated that Khelaifi was under suspicion only for actions taken as the head of the media group, which operates on five continents. Full cooperation The Qatar-based broadcaster issued a statement denying wrongdoing while confirming French authorities had raided the company's Paris offices after a Swiss request. "Following a request by the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland (OAG), the beIN Sports office in Boulogne-Billancourt (France) were searched this morning. The employees on site cooperated with the authorities until the end of the search," beIN said in a statement. "beIN Media Group refutes all accusations made by the OAG. The company will fully cooperate with the authorities and is confident as to the future developments of this investigation." No arrests were made during the searches. Valcke, who was Sepp Blatter's right-hand man at FIFA, was interviewed in Switzerland as a suspect on Thursday, the Swiss prosecutor's office said. In an interview with French sports newspaper L'Equipe on Friday, he denied the allegations. "They say there have been payments from Nasser to me in return for the sale of rights at a preferential rate. But I've received nothing from Nasser", Valcke told the paper. "There has never been an exchange between Nasser and me. Never." SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Sport Media FIFA Switzerland Qatar
A video journalist runs while taking cover behind a wall amid fighting in Iraq's Kurdish region last month [Marwan Ibrahim/AFP/Getty Images] In the early hours of Monday morning, cameraman Arkan Sharif became the latest casualty of Iraq's perilous media environment. Eight masked men burst into the 54-year-old's family home in a village south of Kirkuk and stabbed him to death, his employers at the Kurdistan Satellite Corporation said in a statement. The killers left his half-dressed body lying on the floor, blood pooled around his head and shoulders and a knife embedded in his cheek - an apparent warning. The previous night, an armed mob attacked a television crew outside the regional parliament in Erbil, beating them with sticks. Meanwhile, the Baghdad-based Communication and Media Commission has banned two media outlets linked to t he ruling party in Iraq's Kurdish region , Rudaw and Kurdistan 24, accusing them of inciting violence. The incidents highlight the risks and difficulties of reporting in what is regularly named the world's most dangerous country for journalists. A total of 185 media workers have been killed in Iraq since 2003, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Some died on the battlefield covering battles between security forces and armed groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS ). But most, 111 in all, were murdered - shot or blown up by those their reporting angered. For Iraqi journalists, there are few safe topics. The killers range from militias associated with security forces to groups such as ISIL or its precursor organisations. But the culprits almost always escape justice, says Alexandra el-Khazen, the head of Reporters Without Borders' Middle East desk. Taboo topics Working in such an environment means that journalists tend to self-censor. Taboo topics include corruption allegations levelled at senior figures in Baghdad or Erbil, or abuses by armed groups, particularly the Iran-backed mainly Shia militias known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF). "If you mention their leaders in a way they think is bad, they will be upset and they may kill you or do something else to you," said one Baghdad-based journalist, who spoke on condition of anonymity after having been previously targeted. "There are many militias [in the PMF], but with some, especially Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq or Kata'ib Hezbollah, you must take care," the journalist said, naming groups that were previously involved in attacks on US forces. "The others are probably not going to harm you." You really want to tell the story, you want to tell the truth, but to do it you have to leave the country or stay and risk your life. Hawre Khalid, photojournalist Kurdish media outlets, including Rudaw, have blamed the PMF for Sharif's death, although this has yet to be independently confirmed, as has whether he was killed because of his work. Fear of the PMF is also the reason that a number of Kirkuk-based journalists fled the city when Iraqi forces seized it from Kurdish control on October 16. Several are now in Erbil and believe they will be specifically targeted if they return. Journalists develop different strategies to deal with these threats. An armed group once sent Baghdad-based journalist Mouataz Majid threats, included a letter with a bullet in it. He moved to a different house and started riding partway to work in the back of an ambulance, then eventually left the country for a time. When he returned home and began to work again, he asked that his name not be included on controversial reports in international media outlets. "We are always here," Majid told Al Jazeera. "When the foreign journalists are finished, they go and they leave us behind." Bribes and blackmail Sometimes, anonymity does not provide enough protection, and the decision of whether to pursue certain stories can be wrenching, noted Hawre Khalid, a photographer who claimed asylum in Europe after repeated death threats from al-Qaeda in response to a story he was working on. "That's the worst feeling as a journalist. You really want to tell the story, you want to tell the truth, but to do it you have to leave the country or stay and risk your life," said Khalid, who ultimately decided to return to Iraq to cover the fight against ISIL. Aside from the direct risk of violence, working conditions can be crippling. Laeth Alrashdy, a journalist from Mosul, says that he and his colleagues are regularly threatened by security forces and allied militias who block them from working. "They forbid us from filming because they say we don't have any authorisation even when we do … then the security personnel ask for bribes or blackmail us," Alrashdy said. In some cases, the situation has been exacerbated by partisan media outlets with links to political blocs or armed factions, Khazen noted: "In Kirkuk, some media outlets were following a specific agenda. Biased reports and photos multiplied and were a contributing factor to raising tensions still further." SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Media Iraq Middle East
Journalists gathered outside Malta's parliament [Robin MILLARD/AFP/Getty Images] Journalists in Malta have taken to streets to insist they "will stand up to intimidation" as the sons of slain investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia called on the island nation's prime minister to quit. Hundreds of news industry workers on Thursday gathered outside the parliament in the capital, Valletta, holding up front pages and placards splattered in blood-red paint to protest the murder of Caruana Galizia, a well-known reporter exposing corruption in Malta who was killed in a car bomb attack on Monday. "This is one of the most despicable acts ever carried out in this country. Nobody deserves to die for exercising the right to speak," said Herman Grech, online editor at The Times of Malta, reading a common statement on the industry's behalf. "We stand here today to give hope to society. This attack on one of us will not stop us from shining a light where others want darkness. The attack on one of us will not muzzle us. The attack on one of us will not stop us from fulfilling our role as a watchdog to the institutions. We will stand up to intimidation." The statement urged the government to promote press freedom and stop tolerating incitement against the free media . "We will not stop. We will not be afraid," Grech concluded, to heavy applause. Carrying a red-spattered Maltese flag, the protesting journalists also marched to the Courts of Justice, where an application was filed calling for the investigation into Caruana Galizia's murder to ensure her sources are protected. Malta's newspapers, broadcasters and online media, including the country's many politically partisan outlets, will all carry a common message about press freedom on Sunday. "We have agreed on a national campaign under the slogan: 'the pen conquers fear'," Norma Saliba, chair of the Institute of Maltese Journalists, told AFP news agency. Flowers and tributes for Caruana Galizia lay at the foot of the Great Siege monument in Valletta [Matthew Mirabelli/AFP/Getty Images] 'Show political responsibility and resign' The murder stunned Malta and caused international shock over whether the Mediterranean island is becoming a cesspit of corruption against the backdrop of an economic boom which some see as having allowed both organised crime and a kickbacks culture to flourish. Caruana Galizia, 53, had used her widely read blog, Running Commentary, to highlight numerous cases of suspected corruption, including several scandals implicating the inner circle of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat which had left her facing a string of legal suits. Following the allegations, the Labour leader called, and won, an early election in June. Muscat, who was in Brussels on Thursday, has ruled out quitting and has vowed, with the help of FBI investigators, to bring to justice those responsible for killing a reporter he has described as his "greatest adversary". On Wednesday, Muscat told parliament that the government would put up a "substantial and unprecedented reward" for information leading to a conviction over the assassination. Her sons Matthew, Andrew and Paul said on Thursday that the government was putting up a million euro ($1.2m), but vowed they would not bow to pressure to endorse the idea. "We are not interested in a criminal conviction only for the people in government who stood to gain from our mother's murder to turn around and say that justice has been served," they said. "The prime minister asked for our endorsement. This is how he can get it: show political responsibility and resign." Forensic experts inspect the site of the car bomb blast [Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters] Huge blast Investigators, meanwhile, were looking at similarities with other car bombings in Malta over the last two years - six in all including Caruana Galizia's. None have been solved. Caruana Galizia had just driven away from her home in Mosta, a town outside Malta's capital of Valletta, when the exploded, sending the vehicle's wreckage spiralling over a wall. The force of the blast reduced her car to pieces and catapulted the journalist's body into a nearby field, witnesses said. She leaves behind a husband and three sons. Former police commissioner John Rizzo told the Malta Independent that it appears that mobile detonated explosives were used in each of the six bombings since the start of 2016, which caused four deaths and two serious injuries. The previous victims were all known to police, the paper said. "Very few people could construct such a bomb. Instructions may be obtained online, but building such a device would still require a certain degree of skill," Rizzo said. Investigators have not publicly identified which explosives were used in the journalist's murder, but experts say any military grade explosives, like Semtex, are not available in Malta and would have had to be brought in from abroad.

Twitter said RT and Sputnik may remain "organic users on our platform" [File: Reuters] Twitter says that it will ban ads from two Russian media organisations, citing allegations by US intelligence agencies that Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik tried to interfere with the 2016 presidential election in the US. "Twitter has made the policy decision to off-board advertising from all accounts owned by Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik, effective immediately," the San Francisco-based company said on its website on Thursday. The site said the decision was based on its own investigations of RT and Sputnik as well as the "US intelligence community's conclusion that both RT and Sputnik attempted to interfere with the election on behalf of the Russian government". RT and Sputnik condemned the move, and Moscow threatened retaliatory measures. The ban comes a month after Twitter officials told the US senate that it has suspended 201 Russian-linked accounts amid a congressional investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. US intelligence officials suspect social networks may have contributed in Moscow's alleged propaganda attempt to help elect President Donald Trump. Russia denies the allegation and Trump has also denied any collusion. {articleGUID} In its statement on Thursday, Twitter said it did not "come to this decision lightly". It also said it will donate the estimated $1.9m it had earned from RT since 2011 to "support external research into the use of Twitter in civil engagement and elections, including use of malicious automation and misinformation". RT and Sputnik may remain "organic users on our platform, in accordance with the Twitter rules," it said. Sputnik, RT hit back In response, Sputnik called Twitter's decision "regrettable", while RT said it had "never been involved in any illegal activity online" and "never pursued an agenda of influencing the US election through any platforms, including Twitter". RT also said Twitter had encouraged it to "spend big" on advertising in advance of the election. "The main idea pitched by Twitter to RT was 'to take a stand'. The more money RT spent, the bigger the reach to American voters that Twitter would provide," it said on its website. Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia's foreign ministry, said in a Facebook post that the ban was "an unprecedented attack" and a "gross violation" of free speech guarantees. "This is the result of pressure from the American establishment and intelligence services," she said, adding, "Retaliatory measures will naturally follow". 'Vague rules' Ryan Radia, of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a US-based think-tank, said the ban was "a sign that political pressure is succeeding and changing the behaviour of social media platforms". Such decisions may end up "making it harder for some people to spread both false and true information", he told Al Jazeera. Leonid Ragozin, a Latvia-based journalist who covers Russian affairs, said he feared Moscow may use the ban as an excuse to impose new restrictions on the use of internet in the country, or even shut down Twitter. "There's also the ethical issue," he said. "This matter has not been taken to court and there has been no trial. It was never proved that RT and Sputnik were doing anything illegal." {articleGUID} "It would be more helpful if Twitter focused on bots rather than RT and Sputnik," he said, referring to anonymous accounts and automated accounts. "And it would be much better to invest in teaching audiences in using information properly, to check information and be sceptical about sources of information." Twitter also risked appearing partial by imposing a ban on Russia-linked agencies, he said. "If you look at the Russia bashing info-warriors, some of them employ as much lies, as much misinformation as Russia-linked agencies do," added Ragozin . Padraig Reidy, a former editor at Index on Censorship, a UK-based free speech group, said greater transparency would be a better approach. "It's a little vague what the rules are," he said. "The first step is to be very clear on who is advertising and who is paying for the adverts. They [social media companies] have to show they know where the money is coming from."

Pahoyan, Peru - In June, indigenous communities in the Central Peruvian Amazon marched in the sweltering jungle city of Pucallpa to condemn widespread deforestation in their communities and to commemorate Amazonian victims of environmental conflict. In the remote village of Pahoyan, Antonio Rojas Shuna got word of the protest quickly and in his native language, but not on TV or the internet. Radio is the bridge between the city and indigenous communities. Moises Cardenas Sanchez, Prensa Libre Intercultural "Our Shipibo brothers inform us of what's going on with our territory and the environment," said Rojas Shuna, 53, as he repaired the foundation of his flood-damaged home. In the age of instant access to digital information, radio is redefining its purpose in isolated villages in the Peruvian Amazon, where Spanish is a second language and signs of climate change are everywhere. In Pucallpa and other cities in this region, a growing number of indigenous activists are reclaiming radio to reach communities reeling from environmental issues and to revive their endangered languages. "The indigenous press send messages and speak to us through their programmes and we listen. We feel indigenous," said Limber Maynas Mahya, Chief of Pahoyan, an ethnic Shipibo-Konibo village located 15 hours by boat from Pucallpa along the Ucayali River. His village is struggling to find ways to adapt to deforestation, 36-year-old Mahya told Al Jazeera. Severe flooding has caused Pahoyan to seek higher ground three times in recent years. This February, the village road became a river. The community medical centre was inundated and waterborne illnesses spread. Without help from the regional government, Shipibo language radio programmes in Pucallpa allowed the community to broadcast their struggle and appeal to the outside world for help. Severe flooding caused the isolated Shipibo-Konibo village of Pahoyan to seek higher ground three times in recent years [Neil Giardino/Al Jazeera] "Radio is the bridge between the city and indigenous communities," said Moises Cardenas Sanchez, host of the environmental programme Prensa Libre Intercultural, one of nearly a dozen Shipibo-language radio programmes in Pucallpa. Out of a run down local station in Pucallpa, these Shipibo radio activists are reaching hundreds of thousands in the city and in some of the most remote communities in this part of the Amazon through in-studio broadcasting, testimonies from the field, and the recent integration of live media and podcasting for urban audiences. They are scruffy motorcycle taxi drivers and young mothers, teachers and indigenous youth leaders. Most are urban migrants from isolated communities such as Pahoyan. Pahoyan resident Antonio Rojas Shuna tunes in to Shipibo-language broadcasts for information from the city [Neil Giardino/Al Jazeera] Environmental NGO Global Witness labels Peru as the fourth deadliest country on the planet to be an environmental activist, with at least 57 murdered since 2002. In 2014, four Ashaninka indigenous environmental leaders were murdered in the Ucayali department for defending their land against illegal logging - a practice which can yield twice the profit of its legal counterpart. Despite the risks of speaking out against these practices, Sanchez and his peers take on politically charged topics such as narco-trafficking, illegal mining, and the expansion of palm oil plantations.

Despite the risks, he discusses illegal logging and narco-trafficking in the Peruvian Amazon [Neil Giardino/Al Jazeera] "We put ourselves at risk talking about climate change and the transnational logging companies coming into our communities. But if we don't defend our communities, who will?" Sanchez asks. His Shipibo community, called Caimito, which has lost thousands of hectares of ancestral land in recent years owing to state appropriation, is listening, he said. "I'm conscious of the fact that nobody pays me to be on the radio, but I was born in a community I knew I would one day have to serve," the radio host said. Ruth Ventura's indigenous language radio programme reaches thousands in isolated communities in the Central Peruvian Amazon [Neil Giardino/Al Jazeera] Ruth Ventura is co-host of an environmental justice programme called Radio Informativo FECONAU (Federation of Native Communities of the Ucayali and Affluents), which broadcasts in Shipinol - a mixture of Shipibo and Spanish. Her programme drives her to be a voice for young indigenous women, she said. "I give my perspective, I give my opinion. When I speak I'm the voice for them as well, and that's an important role," said the 28-year-old mother and teacher. ' We've had to fight to earn our place in radio' Inclusion was not always the norm. Shipibo radio pioneer Glorioso Castro Martinez had to break through a wall of discrimination in the early 1980s when he got his start. Indigenous language programmes, he said, just were not given any airtime. We have a great power to make our cultural identity, our territories, our traditional knowledge, our medicinal plants known. Glorioso Castro Martinez, Shipibo radio pioneer "We've had to fight to earn our place in radio. Now, the young people are coming up with their new programmes and it's allowed us to keep going. I'm not alone," he said. His programme, Voz de la Selva, focuses on the environment but devotes time to Shipibo music, art, and culture as well. "We have a great power to make our cultural identity, our territories, our traditional knowledge, our medicinal plants known," said Martinez, 54. The timing might be right for Martinez and his peers in indigenous communication to cast a wider net. The revival and affirmation of Peru's indigenous cultures and languages have reached a national consciousness in recent years, with Quechua language TV and radio now airing in the capital, Lima. Wilder Rodriguez Gonzalez, an indigenous language communication specialist in the Ministry of Education, sees the Shipibo radio movement in Pucallpa as scrappy and full of potential, but noted that it lacks cohesion. "They need to take it a step further. With proper training and more organisation, they can start reaching a national audience," he said. For now, they are hitting their target by reaching most of the roughly 30,000 Shipibo speakers left in the world, with the aim of orienting and driving them to action in their communities. Indigenous radio pioneer and activist Glorioso Castro Martinez at a rally in Pucallpa, June 5, 2017 [Neil Giardino/Al Jazeera] Back in Pahoyan, Alberto Franchini Silvano sat on his porch, turning the FM dial of his portable radio. The static cleared and a voice in Shipibo discussed illegal logging. "Our Shipibo ancestors never had these problems," said the 50-year-old elementary school teacher, with a hint of hopelessness in his voice. He has recently begun teaching his students about their obligation to protect their forests. "When I hear these programmes in my language it makes me want to stand up and do something about it," he said.

Gender divisions start at a young age. The children in this picture do not depict the characters in this story [Getty Images] The boys' voices were getting louder. The argument over who had the best design for a sampling probe had devolved into an argument about who's idea was "just really stupid". I sat in the science class, surrounded by Lego at a table designed for eighth graders, listening preoccupied to their argument. My mind was elsewhere, fascinated by the only girl on their team, who was doing something remarkable. My presence in that classroom two decades ago was the result of a nearly two-year journey. As an anthropology student at The College of Charleston, I had designed a project to try to understand the high attrition rate of underrepresented students in mathematics and science. My idea: problem-based learning on cooperative teams, rather than the lecture-based and competitive approaches common in schools. Each class would choose a semester-long problem and a mission to solve the problem, including what "success" meant. To illustrate the variety of work, collaboration and teamwork go into science, the only stipulation was they had to define cooperative teams. "Our team is going to be the best," one boy in my first class immediately announced. "Then you will fail," I responded gravely. "This is how science works," I said to the class. "There is no final exam here. There is only the mission. You succeed at the mission, and you all pass. But if your team thinks it's the best while another team fails, then the mission fails. And if the mission fails, every one of you fails this class." It was a grave message to give to eighth graders. It was also a rather audacious project and one that took some convincing to institute. The first school principal I brought it to laughed me out of her office, telling me that I should return when I had a degree and an understanding of how to teach children. Fair criticism, if short-sighted. Problem-based learning was certainly nothing new by the late 1990s, but it had yet to enter the gestalt of the South Carolina school system. Very quickly, I began to feel like the mythical Cassandra, holder of an important truth no one would believe. Time and time again, I was rejected, but I knew deep down in that place where all unknown and untested truths are known and need no test, that my idea would work, so I was undaunted. After all, I'm an American. Our heroes - in both our history and our fiction - are dominantly men (we're not so keen on women) who did whatever crazy thing they wanted to do, despite everyone telling them not to. READ MORE: Luke Cage - How a black boy became a superhero Fighting the system The United States loves the underdog, the dissenter who fights stupidity, or oppression, or both until he arises, at last, victorious (and completely unaware of the collateral damage). That tale is instilled in us as canon before many of us know how to read. It's basically the US' origin story. So when faced with rejection by "the system," I simply fought the system harder. Finally, a middle school in a Charleston suburb gave me a spot for my first class. That class, enthralled as they were with the then current news of the Mars Pathfinder, chose a similar project. They created teams to do research, public relations, funding, logistics, and the team I was sitting with during the argument: robotics. The Robotics team consisted of three boys and one girl, Kristen Valles*, who joined the team despite the fact that she "couldn't help much because [she didn't] know anything about robots". It was Kristen whom I was so absorbed in watching. The argument had devolved further from "your idea is stupid" to "you're stupid". Against the backdrop of this invective, Kristen pulled oddly shaped Lego pieces out of the boxes on the table. I thought she was simply playing, doing the Lego equivalent of doodling, until she leaned back and silently tested a working sampling probe designed fundamentally differently than anything the boys were arguing about. I looked at the boys to see if they realised what had happened, but they were all oblivious to her actions and indeed her very presence. When I looked back at Kristen, she was just as silently deconstructing her work. Then she sat quietly and waited for their argument to end. In four classes over three years, that gender acculturation would play out so many times one could think it staged. If two or more boys were together, they would argue over who was right. It was as if every boy lived in his own American Cassandra myth, sure that he held the truth, and ready to fight until he was victorious, despite the collateral damage. Girls, by contrast, would most often just solve the problem. It was common to have girls suggest they try another person's design and then try theirs - a tactic I thought was based on confidence in the other's failure until (with remarkable slowness) I recognised that it was actually an efficient way to avoid an argument by giving another person voice, while simultaneously testing all solutions to find the best. At their heart, science and engineering are not about being right, but about solving problems. It looked to me as though girls obviously had the better strategy for solving problems. The boy's core competency seemed to be fighting. READ MORE: 50 Cent, Johnny Cash and the history of hip-hop Diversity and inclusion Recently, one of those argumentative boys - not one of my former students, although he could easily have been - wrote a manifesto at Google challenging diversity and inclusion initiatives. Too many analyses have already been written for me to think I can nail a coffin lid to a horse carcass. I'm rather more interested in the broader response itself. Of the text, one sentence, in particular, struck me: "When it comes to diversity and inclusion, Google's left bias has created a politically correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into silence." Here, again, we see our beloved origin story: the brave dissenter, challenging stupidity and oppression. Unfortunately for lovers of that story, the truth is much more mundane, if more uncomfortable. It is ironic that Google would be seen as a politically correct monoculture. As a company it is something like two percent black and embroiled in a legal battle with the US Department of Labor over "discrimination against women [that] is quite extreme, even in this industry". And Google is not alone, it is merely toeing the party line of the supposed left-leaning Silicon Valley, which is a hi-tech centre that apparently specialises in the creation of headlines on everything from sexual harassment to employees paid so little they are forced to live in garages. And lest we criticise Silicon Valley alone, it is simply toeing California's party line, which banned affirmative action programmes in the late 1990s and destroyed minority college enrollment rates, effectively removing any hope of solving the supposed "pipeline problem". California, meanwhile, is really just following the great American standard. Our biggest success in all aspects of diversity is the self-congratulatory suggestion that we look at "how much better it is than 50 years ago". It's understandable that the manifesto's author would see things this way. Many who question diversity are rarely conscious of the homogeneity of their immediate surroundings. Our tragic Cassandra feels shamed in a monoculture populated almost entirely by the US' holy trinity: straight, white and male. It would be comically ironic, if it weren't so frustrating. I have no doubt the author is surrounded by groupthink liberals whose knee-jerk reaction is mob-like ostracism. Any black American knows that scene as the most mundane American drama. The overlap of racist realities with liberal demographics is generations old and points to an uncomfortable truth those liberals often find too easy to ignore. Sadly, "diversity" is the new "politically correct," and we all know what a disaster that has become. What was intended as a way to learn a modicum of cultural sensitivity became that wretched assurance to white people that if they said African American instead of black, they were not racist - despite their actual thoughts or actions. Many white people's understanding never gets further than "What's the right word to call negroes now?" So much of what we hear as "politically correct" is the result of one white person telling another white person what "the right word is," while both are too nervous to ask, or worse, too unconcerned to learn anything from the people they are talking about. READ MORE: What if your identity was a lie? 'Genetic differences' Diversity can easily live out a similar existence as a check mark on white America's to-do list if it follows a similar methodology of white men wanting to feel good about themselves without inviting anyone else into the room. Scanning news articles and Medium posts about the Google manifesto illustrates this danger. One immediately notices the overwhelming number of white male responses focusing on what the author did or should have done. Contrast this with the (fewer) number of responses from women, most of which focus on their own experiences. I would agree there is probably an echo chamber in Google, I just seriously doubt it is echoing anything but the US' status quo. The juxtaposition between the stated core values espoused by Google's senior leadership and the stunning lack of diversity in their employment allows only the most willingly blind observers to trust their motives. It is impossible for any thinking person to believe that a company whose core competency is essentially "the ability to find anything" would be totally stumped on how to find a single black engineer. The only reasonable conclusion is that they have no real desire to do so. In his letters from the Birmingham Jail, Martin Luther King Jr shamed the white moderate, those of a liberal mind who sided with the oppressed in concept, but who did little to help - or even obstructed - their progress. This is similar to how I see much of liberal America, and certainly much of the technology industry. Diversity is a nice idea in concept, but it can wait for "a more convenient season" - that season likely being after a company's exit strategy or possibly as a settlement of its sexual harassment lawsuit. I agree with King's frustration at the white moderate. At least the manifesto author - and by proxy, the conservative establishment - is honest about the lack of concern for achieving real equity in underrepresented groups. Like King, I would rather deal with his absolute misunderstanding than with the shallow understanding of much of liberal America. The former is at least an unfair fight I might labour to make fair. When Dylann Roof killed nine innocent people at Emanuel AME church in Charleston, liberal white America was quick to condemn him as an evil individual, not indicative of any broader social construct. As if the Confederate flag flying over the South Carolina statehouse meant nothing. As if the mass incarceration of black men for generations has meant nothing. As if generations of redlining home ownership in liberal white communities has meant nothing. Liberals asked why he did it, never asking "Why have I allowed this?" Liberal white America saw in Dylann Roof an other, abhorrent and unlike them in every way. Yet he was an outcome of so much that America - even liberal America - promotes and yet shirks responsibility for. Dylann Roof was an extremist supported as much by the soft silence of liberals as by the racist uncles they share the Christmas table with and do not openly oppose for fear that doing so might make the holiday dinner uncomfortable. I see a similar disingenuousness in the outcry about this manifesto. Are we so willingly blind that we honestly expected anything less? If so, it's remarkable how easy it is to condemn the evil other when we can use that to avoid facing our responsibility for the society we ourselves have created and work to maintain. The opinions of the manifesto and the assurance that "they certainly do not reflect our core values" are both core American conceits. During my anthropology research over three years, nearly all eighth-grade girls I interviewed indicated they were not good at science and mathematics - even those planning to choose it as a career. Those girls decided they would simply have to work harder or, in the words of one heartbreaking response, "maybe not be as good, but still do my best". By contrast, most boys thought they were good at maths and science. Even more to the point, most boys thought that girls were not as good as boys at maths and science. Let this sink in: By the age of 10, the US has successfully conditioned her boys to assume that girls can't do maths and science, at least not as well as they can. Suggesting women aren't suited to hi-tech jobs because of "genetic differences" is something any one of my 10-year-old boys would have written. Girls aren't as good, it's innate, no big deal. That author is little more than a mindless drone thoughtlessly promoting the core message of The American Cultural Machine. Yet our knee-jerk reaction is to condemn him for being The Evil Manifesto Author so we can sleep well knowing the lack of representation and support for underrepresented groups has nothing whatsoever to do with our own actions or lack thereof. Google's solution was to fire him, make a weak statement about "core values," and get back to working on that discrimination lawsuit. Rather than ostracise him into martyrdom, I'd rather his manifesto be ignored - or used as an example to teach other 10-year-old boys - while we move forward on actually doing the hard work of social equality that we should, but obviously are not, doing. At the very least, we should stop dramatically shouting about his wrongness as if we don't implicitly support both his fundamental position and the atmosphere that gave to its publication. Unless you're a brown-skinned lesbian without a trust fund, you need to admit you have some skin in his game. Even I, as a straight male, am complicit. This was made clear to me two decades before it was even written in the way I embarrassed the only girl on a team by thoughtlessly calling her out in front of her classmates. "Not one of you saw what Kristen did," I said, stupidly unaware of her discomfort. "While all of you were arguing, she built a design better than all of yours. Kristen, why did you take it apart?" "They were arguing," she said, "so I thought their designs were better." None of them were, but they were willing to fight. And one of them was eventually chosen, because the boy who designed it was confident, assertive, and most of all kept fighting. In the end, Kristen voted for his design, too. That's a tragic lesson I never meant to teach: Who the beneficiaries are of our cultural biases. In the US, he who argues loudest and longest reigns victorious, regardless of the collateral damage. *Name has been changed John Metta has Bachelor's degrees in geology and anthropology and Master's degrees in geography and ecological engineering.

Medellin , Colombia - When Gladys Betancur Piedrahita was a young girl growing up on a coffee farm in the Andes mountain town of Angostura in Colombia , her grandmother fell ill. Gladys watched her mother and aunt care for their mother before she died. Soon after, Gladys' aunt developed the same mysterious illness. She suffered for three years until, at the age of 38, she too passed away. Then, about a decade ago, Gladys' mother, Magnolia, started to exhibit the by now familiar symptoms. At first, Magnolia repeated stories, telling them four or five times. She flung her food or buried it. She left the house and wandered around, lost. A soft-spoken woman, she turned, without warning, wildly aggressive. Gladys , now 37, recognised the signs. Her mother, like other family members, had early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Gladys' hometown is one of a handful in Colombia's rugged state of Antioquia where many residents - possibly because the area's remoteness has fostered generations of intermarriage - have a genetic mutation on a chromosome that causes early onset Alzheimer's. The result is that if one parent has the disease, their child has a 50 percent chance of developing it. Gladys speaks to Lucia Madrigal, a nurse, about the condition of her mother for whom she has been a carer for years. Their hometown of Angostura is one of a handful of towns in the remote Colombian region of Antioquia with the highest concentration of a genetic mutation that causes early onset Alzheimer's [Sruthi Gottipati/Al Jazeera] A scientific laboratory In other parts of the world, no one can know if they will get Alzheimer's as no single gene has been identified as causing it. But the certainty of getting the disease if you carry the mutation has made this region a scientific laboratory of sorts, offering something no other place does - a possible answer as to how to prevent a disease that strikes millions around the world. Medellin, the capital of Antioquia, is now home to a multi-million-dollar drug trial where researchers have enrolled residents to find a solution to early-onset Alzheimer's, in the hope of eventually being able to prevent the late in life form of the disease as well. "We noticed there were families where generations of people have been sick," says Lucia Madrigal, 64, a nurse who, along with a neurologist, first began researching Alzheimer's in the area. "So we started studying them. Our question was, what happens to these people? What happened to them that so many generations of the same family were sick?" Although men and women have the same chances of getting Alzheimer's , a disease known for the toll it exacts on caregivers, the burden of care in Colombia, like elsewhere in the world, typically falls on women - wives, mothers, daughters, aunts - who cope with caring for their families even as they know that their loved ones, and they themselves, face frightening odds. As the research facility at the University of Antioquia races against time to find a preventive solution - they are in the fourth year of the clinical trial and have four more years to go - for most of these families, Alzheimer's is already a reality. Caring from dawn until after dusk Gladys never stops working. Her routine has calcified - a relentless march from dawn until after dusk, day in and day out. After she sends off her two daughters - one to work, the other to school - she settles into a daily care routine for Magnolia, now aged 59. Gladys fixes her breakfast, bathes her, then begins physiotherapy, which includes massaging her skin. Watch how Indonesian social workers rescue elderly people with Alzheimer's who have been abandoned by their families "I take her out when the day is nice and then put her in bed to prepare lunch," she explains. Gladys then single-handedly lifts Magnolia into a chair to feed her, careful not to hurt her mother's spine in the process. "Physically, it's hard because she's very rigid." In the afternoon, more therapy before Gladys prepares dinner, cleans the house and takes care of her pets (three cats and two dogs). She puts her mother to bed at 8:30pm. "Mentally, it makes me depressed, but you start getting used to it." Gladys used to run a grocery store, but when her mother fell sick, she quickly realised that taking care of Magnolia would be a full-time job. Although Gladys has two sisters and a brother who could help, they had to keep their jobs to help out financially. "One of us had to stop working, and I decided to be the one [to] do that," Gladys says. "It was not an obligation," she quickly adds. "It was my wish to do so." She sold her store and now sells cosmetic products from a catalogue to neighbours and relatives from home. Clinical trials The last time Gladys took a day off was a year and a half ago. Her sisters volunteered to take Magnolia for the day. " I relaxed and slept until late," she says. "I went out to the cinema, went for a hike and went out to eat with my daughter." But when Magnolia was returned, she was sicker than usual. Gladys believes it was because of the change in temperature - she was in a windier neighbourhood - and she had to be taken to the hospital. The incident convinced Gladys that she should never let her mother out of her sight. "The caregiver is often alone, dedicating 24 hours a day to the sick person," Lucia, the nurse, explains. "They have a strong physical and mental burden day after day." The only time that Gladys is apart from her mother now is when she and her brother go to participate in the clinical trial, a trip she rushes through every 15 days. "I have hope that the study will have results. I really dedicated myself to it," she says. "I don't want my daughters to go through this." For either of her daughters to hold the gene, Gladys would have to have it. She doesn't know whether she does - none of the clinical trial participants are told if they do. But she doesn't allow herself to believe she may get Alzheimer's even though she and her siblings face a coin flip in odds. Despite seeing the sickness ravage her mother every day, "you live with the disease and try not to think of the disease," she says. "It's worse knowing than not knowing." Despite Alzheimer's, a household of women and laughter When I visit in June, Gladys' younger daughter, Angie Lizeth Rojo Betancur, who is 16 years old, is due to give birth in a week - to a boy. Right now, "it's only women in this house," Gladys points out. Gladys' daughter Angie Lizeth Rojo Betancur, 16, is photographed a week before she was due to give birth to a son, the only male in the all-female household [Sruthi Gottipati/Al Jazeera] Gladys , who moved to Medellin when she married, separated from her husband three years ago. Her father, who sold their coffee farm in the country, also lives in the city but in another house. Her father, she says, h as never helped her mother, through care or cash. "He never even changed her diaper," Gladys says. "I brought her here three years ago, and he's come twice to see her." He lives alone in the house. In contrast, Gladys' home, which sits on a steep slope, is filled with jokes, animals - and laughter. Magnolia, propped up in a wheelchair and wearing a hoodie in the living room, caresses one of the cats curled up on her lap. Gladys bends to scratch Magnolia's nose. "I know when it itches," she says; Gladys recognises Magnolia's telltale gesture. Angie, who sits at the dining table eating a chocolate biscuit with a glass of milk, recalls her grandmother as being affectionate. Her earliest memory of that changing was when Magnolia, already showing signs of Alzheimer's, spanked her when she was seven or eight years old. Angie was stunned by Magnolia's behaviour but said she felt better after going to workshops at the Alzheimer's research facility, which explained the disease's symptoms to her. Angie, who is studying to be a chemical engineer, says she wouldn't be able to manage with the baby if it weren't for her family. Behind her, Gladys folds and refolds Magnolia's limbs to keep them supple and props her head against a fluffy lime-green pillow. When the carers get Alzheimer's The Piedrahita family's story echoes others' in Antioquia. Consuela de las Mercedes Valencia Mora, 69, a warm, chatty grandmother with close-cropped hair, says she grew up in Angostura surrounded by cattle, sugar cane and the dread of seeing an unknown disease spread its tentacles to claim friends and neighbours. "Everyone would say, 'Oh, this one is going to die of stupidity' because we didn't know what the disease was," she says. Consuela has lost numerous family members to Alzheimer's [Sruthi Gottipati/Al Jazeera] Consuela , who has four sisters, says that one of her two sisters who died of Alzheimer's had 14 children, four of whom now have the disease, while six others have already died from it. She says the four remaining siblings are unlikely to get the disease since they're past the age - typically their 30s and 40s - when people start showing symptoms of this particular mutation. "When they call me to say somebody died, I just say, 'Thank God, it's okay. It's a horrible disease'," she says. "This is worse than AIDS and cancer." It's especially tough on caregivers, she adds. "In every family that I see, I ask: 'Who is taking care of this person?' It's always the wives and daughters, but those very people get sick themselves." In Gladys' darkest, bleakest moments - seeing Alzheimer's sever the arms of her family tree - she taps into a wellspring of emotion to fortify her resolve. "The love for my children gives me a lot of strength and the love that my mum always gave us," she says. "If the sick person was my father, it would've been more difficult because he was never there for us." In the living room, Magnolia faces the street from her wheelchair, sunlight pouring in through the door and windows. Gladys heats milk for tea. One of her dogs settles near her feet. "The female dog, she learned everything from the cat," Gladys notes with fondness. "So she licks herself and behaves like a cat."

Amanda Hawes, left, speaks to Maria, a Cuban coffee worker who resembles the Spanish professor, Justina Ruiz de Conde, who Hawes says inspired her to become a lawyer [Photo courtesy of Amanda Hawes] On January 21, the day after Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States , women around the world marched "for human rights, civil liberties, and social justice for all" - concepts some feared might be endangered under the Trump administration. Among those marching in San Jose on that blustery January day was veteran occupational health lawyer Amanda Hawes. Hawes carried a sign that read "Super Callow Fragile Ego Trump You Are Atrocious" in a play on words from the classic Mary Poppins tune. An image of her and her sign went viral. The 73-year-old Harvard Law School graduate has walked the hi-tech corridors of Silicon Valley for the past 43 years. During that time, she has taken on tech giants, representing electronics workers - many of them immigrants or the children of immigrants from Mexico and Central America, the Philippines, China , Iran, the Azores, Vietnam and Cambodia - who, during the course of their work, were exposed to toxic chemicals linked to cancer, autoimmune disorders and other diseases. Occupational health lawyer Amanda Hawes at the San Jose's Women's March on January 21 [Photo courtesy of Mercury News] "Over the past 40 years, I have represented hundreds of electronics workers in workers' compensation claims, scores of children of electronics workers in civil litigation seeking compensation for developmental harm, and over a hundred families impacted by water contamination from the so-called 'clean industry'," said Hawes, referring to the term sometimes used for the electronics industry. In 1977, she cofounded the Santa Clara Center for Occupational Safety and Health (SCCOSH). "From 1978 to 1980, with a grant from the US Labor Department, SCCOSH staff did research on chemical and radiation hazards in electronics manufacturing, made the information available in English, Spanish and Tagalog, including fact sheets and booklets, and ran a hotline for electronics workers to call with questions or information they wanted to share," she explained. "SCCOSH provided the scientific data to support a California-wide worker campaign for a ban on the degreasing solvent TCE (trichloroethylene) in the workplace and to press for better controls on 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA) the so-called 'safe substitute' for TCE." The price of innovation In the midst of a technology revolution that shows no sign of slowing down, the cases pursued by Hawes suggest humanity may be paying a heavy price for its innovation. "There's very little manufacturing occurring in Silicon Valley, at this time," Hawes explained. "Some of the claims that I've been pursuing more recently come from work experiences they've (the workers) had many, many years ago ... "A lot of the work I've been doing has been on behalf of electronics workers whose children were exposed in utero, so they (the children) are often chronologically adults but mentally that's never going to be. They're never going to have an independent life, have no capacity to support themselves basically, or have the things everybody hopes for their children." Ted Smith, the founder of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC), is Hawes's partner and co-author of, Challenging the Chip: Labor Rights and Environmental Justice in the Global Electronics Industry . He described the greatest health, environmental and labour concerns associated with the tech industry as the disregard shown for the places where e-waste is dumped and burned, the migration of hi-tech facilities to impoverished countries where worker protection is weak, and the ongoing health repercussions for manufacturing workers dealing with toxic chemicals. E-waste refers to any electronic items, or parts of those items, that need to be disposed of, including mobile devices, tablets, computers, televisions and others. Silicon Valley and other tech hubs continue to send the majority of their e-waste to developing countries, in attempts to keep their factories "clean". But when e-waste is incorrectly disposed of, poisonous hydrocarbons are released into the air and heavy metals leak into the soil. These pollutants can travel long distances, affecting people thousands of miles away. The chemicals not only seep into the soil where they were disposed, but become intrinsically linked to the global food chain, as animals consume food, inhale air and drink water that has come into contact with toxic materials. Power, profit and 'planned obsolescence' Hawes, Smith, the SVTC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and numerous other organisations, both nonprofit and governmental , have fought for workers' occupational health rights for decades. Why, then, does change still seem so evasive? Planned obsolescence and industry ignorance are high on the list, said Hawes and Smith. Kyle Wiens, cofounder of wiki-based tech repair and salvage site iFixit , gave an example of this intentional obsolescence: "Every cellphone I've ever had, you just pop the back off ... every year or two, you have to replace the battery. Apple has decided with the iPod and the iPhone that they don't like that model. So what they are doing is building the batteries into the phone and using proprietary screws on there in [an] attempt to limit the lifespan of the phone to about 18 months - which is around the time when they have a new phone and they want you to buy a new one anyway." Al Jazeera put the claim of "planned obsolescence" to Apple but has received no response from their representatives. This rapid change doesn't only mean more e-waste but also creates a rushed innovation environment in which many chemicals are not trialled and tested adequately for health and safety requirements, said the SVTC. "Some of the chemicals that are used to clean computer electronic products, to degrease them, they've got a prior history as anaesthetic gasses," explained Hawes. "That doesn't mean they're safe. It means pay attention to what happened to the workers around the anaesthetic gasses [as an example]. They suffered reproductive harm that was very well documented in the 1960s and the 1970s and then this industry went ahead and used vast quantities of the same chemicals and never did a thing." The first sign of adverse reproductive effects from electronics industry chemicals emerged in Silicon Valley in 1982. The State Health Department had identified a cluster of cardiac birth defects in a neighbourhood served by a well that had been contaminated by waste solvents, including the aforementioned TCA, that had been unsafely stored on site at Fairchild and IBM. The solvents had seeped through porous soil and into the well. A high rate of spontaneous abortion among women working in the industry was also discovered. Hawes said much has been done since then to try and combat these issues. " I was one of a team of lawyers who represented the many families whose water was contaminated by these solvents in a large case that was resolved in 1986," she said. "The aftermath of this water contamination problem has involved massive clean-up efforts, not just at this site but at other sites across the valley - a very costly way of proving the obvious benefits of preventing harm in the first place. In the mid-1980s, SCCOSH and the SVTC mounted a campaign to get glycol ethers - a family of solvents identified as reproductive and developmental hazards - phased out of manufacturing. Hawes says the industry resisted, but the campaigns persisted. " Over the years, and despite efforts to keep regulators at bay, there has been progress in identifying chemicals that pose a reproductive or developmental threat and requiring effective disclosures of this aspect of their toxicity, eg California's Proposition 65 adopted in the mid-1980s, the California Right-to-Know laws of 1981 and the Federal Hazard Communication Right-to-Know law of 1986. Hawes is currently involved in a movement to encourage the industry to commit to only using materials that are demonstrably free of risks to the health of workers and their prospective offspring. "This is called the Life Cycle Approach to chemicals management, and in my opinion, should be a guiding principle in all chemical-using industries," she explained. The cost of failing to prevent harm Hawes believes a complex regulation system and varying standards for different chemicals, and combinations of chemicals, makes dealing with cases after the damage has been done more difficult. "... Most people, if they're exposed to hazards at work, it's not a single chemical, it's usually an entire group, maybe multiple solvents and heavy metals. That's a terrible mixture. We do have some standards, but they are chemical by chemical. If you're working with a group of materials, those standards really aren't going to protect you, even if they might be adequate for one situation ... there's a huge discrepancy," she said. The SVTC believes a lack of interest in education and prevention is at the heart of the tech industry's problems with toxic e-waste and occupational health and safety. But the cost of prevention, says Hawes, is significantly lower than the cost to the environment and to the tech firms themselves of not preventing the use of dangerous chemicals. "Where's the motivation to become fully informed and to provide a safe work environment?" asked Hawes. "There was [in the 1970s and 1980s] plenty of information, and serious efforts to make it available to employers, so that they could [use their] influence [to enforce standards regarding] what their responsibility is to provide safe workplaces." "How that stopped short of providing workplaces that were free of risk, or reproductive harm, long-term illness ... In some situations, it was a pretty strong resistance [from the tech firms] to the government regulating the industry, because here we are, we're technologically cutting edge. What could be better than that? "We have a very incomplete health and safety enforcement structure. As much as we want it to be effective, it's stretched very thin," Hawes said. 'It breaks my heart' Yvette Flores and her son, Mark, are evidence of this. Speaking to the makers of, Death by Design , a documentary that investigates the deadly health and environmental costs of the tech industry, Flores described her experience working with laser giant Spectra-Physics, in Mountain View, California, in the 1970s. She recalled working daily with an unknown substance she nicknamed "green gunk". Hawes, who represented Flores, said the substance was, in fact, a poisonous chemical called "frit". "Yvette didn't know the material she was using was probably in the vicinity of 50 percent lead oxide. She didn't know she was exposed to lead. They didn't tell her that," Hawes explained. "In the late 1970s, there were no 'right to know' laws that she could have invoked to learn about the reproductive and developmental hazards of her job before it was too late." The Flores case was resolved just before going to trial. Flores's son Mark, who is now 37, was born with severe developmental disabilities. Flores said he is unable to cross the street or use the toilet independently. "If I knew what I know now, I would've ran out of Spectra-Physics at the time. It was unnecessary. It breaks my heart that I could've avoided this," she reflected. We don't have fair standards for workers in the first place. Dismantling environmental standards is a predictor of what they would do. They're also, simply put, not enforcing fundamental health and safety standards....I don't think that's ever going to change. Amanda Hawes, occupational health lawyer 'Time's up' for the tech industry On March 13, the White House released its first preliminary budget under Trump. The most notable changes were deep cuts to US science and environmental agency budgets, including that of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The 31 percent cut followed closely on the heels of former Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt's assignment to the role of EPA's new leader. Pruitt's track record as attorney general included attempts to repeatedly sue the EPA for items of environmental protection put forward by the Obama administration. Hawes said she fears "dismantling environmental standards is a predictor of what" the Trump administration may do, but that the issue did not start and will not end with the Trump administration. "We don't have fair standards for workers in the first place," she said. Hawes explained what motivates her: " I would imagine that I am viewed [by tech and electronics companies] as a 'thorn in their side' or something like that. Around 1980, the lawyer for one semiconductor firm against whom I brought workers' compensation claims told me the company president 'couldn't understand how one Harvard graduate could be doing this to another'." "If we can help each other than you're accomplishing what everybody should be entitled to ... Safe jobs, healthy families, that should be universal." And she had a message for the tech industry: "Y ou don't want to hear it, but the answer is you grew it, you ignored it and now time's up."

Protesters make their way through Seattle Centre during the March For Science in Seattle on April 22 [Reuters/David Ryder] Today, scientists nationwide and across the globe are taking to the streets in defence of science. In the weeks leading up to the march, social media and the news have been abuzz with questions about scientists marching en masse: What finally spurred researchers to leave their labs to march in defence of their work? Is this march political? (The organisers confirm that, yes, this is political but also insist that they are non-partisan.) Is the march becoming too political in talking about diversity and "injecting identity politics" into a field that ostensibly does not need to address those issues right now? Or is it not political enough in failing to grapple with larger societal problems that affect marginalised scientists and their communities? Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5407650744001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5407650744001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > Can people power change political anti-science agenda? - Inside Story PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY While questions of how, when, and why scientists should engage in politics continue to linger in our minds, the March for Science has unequivocally shown that scientists can no longer afford to be "apolitical". Or perhaps more accurately, a specific segment of the scientific community has now discovered that they, too, must be invested in politics. With the Trump administration defunding the National Institute of Health, issuing gag orders to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, US Department of Agriculture and Environmental Protection Agency, and demanding the removal of data from federal websites, many scientists have realised that their years of education and research is being threatened. Loss of funding, an inability to communicate their findings to the public, devaluing science education and research, and ignoring scientific evidence impinge on scientists' ability to ask questions about the workings of the universe and expand human knowledge. In short, scientists are increasingly unable to do science . And as such, the March is less of a march for science but a march for the freedom to do and value science . Differentiating "marching for science" from "scientists marching" is perhaps the crux of why the March for Science organisers have been criticised by marginalised scientists for failing to be inclusive. While many scientists have not felt their work threatened or undermined before 2017, many others have - and have for decades - because they are from historically marginalised backgrounds. And unfortunately, the voices of marginalised people within STEM were dismissed in organising the March for Science as they are within academia and within society at large, emphasising yet again that marginalised scientists' concerns are not viewed as "real issues" under attack. In the #marginsci hashtag on Twitter - started by Dr Stephani Page -scientists of colour, LGBTQ scientists, disabled scientists, and scientists who live at the intersections of these various identities have shared their personal experiences of being a marginalised person in a field where so scientists who share similar experiences of discrimination are few and far in between. There is no shortage of stories about feeling unwelcome within their professions, struggling to secure funding, be published, and pursue and achieve tenure. Outside of the lab or fieldwork, marginalised scientists must also grapple with societal-level issues that directly affect their lives, health, and safety in ways that many of their colleagues never have to worry about. It is in this environment that marginalised scientists have long raised concerns about diversity and inclusion within the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field. And unfortunately, the voices of marginalised people within STEM were dismissed in organising the March for Science as they are within academia and within society at large, emphasising yet again that marginalised scientists' concerns are not viewed as "real issues" under attack. To be clear, science itself is not under threat. Science is merely a tool for understanding the universe, and the scientific method allows us to do that in observable and reproducible ways. No one is prohibiting us from asking questions, forming hypotheses, testing those hypotheses, collecting and analysing data, and ultimately interpreting data to confirm or reject hypotheses. Science - the process, the tool - has existed since time immemorial and will continue to exist as long as humans do. We are a naturally curious species, and no amount of legislation, lack of funding, or science denial will prevent us from continuing to seek knowledge. But science can only exist as long as there are people to do it. And the best science comes from an inclusive scientific community - one in which marginalised scientists are valued as being more than a "diversity hire", one in which we have the freedom to ask new and different questions informed by our perspectives on the world. It is a scientific community that sees their role in society as responsible to people and communities, especially to marginalised ones. Such a scientific community can only exist if we not only march for science but also march for larger issues of justice - things that most scientists would consider "out of their interest" but directly impact our marginalised colleagues.

How can we stand with Standing Rock to defend sacred lands and protect the environment from oil spills and continued reliance on fossil fuels? What would it look like if scientists marched not only to defend researchers' right to whistle blow when our water is poisoned, as Dr Mona Hanna-Attisha, but also to defend clean water as a human right and to demand immediate action in response? The March for Science is a microcosm of the scientific community, which is a microcosm of society at large. If, instead of marching for the freedom to do science, scientists marched for freedom itself - freedom from racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, Islamophobia, xenophobia, and ableism in society, what can only result but freedom to do science? Imagine then what new knowledge will be discovered and new technologies made! There is no freedom without justice. So if we are to march, let us march for science justice. And perhaps ironically, the March organisers got it right when they posted in January this now-deleted tweet : "colonization, racism, immigration, native rights, sexism, ableism, queer-, trans-, intersex-phobia & econ justice are scientific issues".

Jobs are disappearing, incomes retreating, the precariat growing. Thousands of people risk their lives in stormy seas to flee wars, moribund economies and climate change on a daily basis. Traditional politicians continue to avoid publicly addressing the tsunami of unemployment , apparently baffled as to how to react to a historic transition: the automation of critical masses of labour once performed by humans.

In the process, however, these innovations risk transforming the world around us, and upsetting humanity's very definition of itself. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a series of algorithms designed to improve the performance of robots by making it possible for them to learn from their surroundings. As AI increasingly autonomises formerly human-managed objects like cars and factory assembly lines, it displaces not only millions of workers employed in repetitive jobs like driving and assembling products, but white-collar employees, too. With the Internet of Things expanding into the physical realm, you'll find yourself encountering AI-enhanced objects more often, especially in service industries. Replacing humans with robotic transactions delivered in unthreatening lilts, AI will further contribute to our de-socialisation, and feed the self-absorption and narcissism fuelled by Internet-powered consumerism. READ MORE: Could artificial intelligence lead to world peace? Augmented Reality (AR) will overlay information onto the naked world, earning its wearers social, professional and other edges over those sticking to the boring old reality. Soon, augmenting your surroundings will become as essential as a cellphone if you want to participate in employed living. Projectors and screens will be done away as spreadsheets and calendars are "shared" with colleagues during work meetings by superimposing them over reality. Augmented Reality (AR) will overlay information onto the naked world, earning its wearers social, professional and other edges over those sticking to the boring old reality, writes Athanasiadis [Getty] Nanobot implants will connect journalists to the internet, allowing them to dispense with cameras and use their own eyes and ears to film interviews, or perform real-time background checks on people they have just met. Soldiers will view aerial perspectives of the complex they're about to assault, streamed from hovering drones, while supporting engineers thousands of miles away broadcast 3D immersive designs of the complex and its occupants direct to the soldiers' vision. Later, the soldiers themselves will be replaced by agile robots, as the debate over the permissibility of lethal killing machines is won by those arguing for using them against conveniently dehumanised "terrorists". OPINION: Rebellion against the invisible tyrant - The internet The element of surprise or enchantment in everyday life - as indispensable a part of being human as missing someone or feeling melancholy - will be even further retrenched, replaced by accumulating, awkward time-outs: motionless figures in public spaces, apparently present, but absorbed in a private, incommunicable world. Soon, turning on the computer or fishing your phone out of your pocket will no longer be a precondition to being online. Potentially, the greatest game-changer is Blockchain (BC). It leverages the power of an online distributed ledger system in creating an all-encompassing, entirely interconnected digital grid that can be used to assess participants on a staggering tally of issues. Though open to authoritarian abuse, this tool would also enable individuals to delink themselves from the arbitrariness of the nation-state organising principle. BC could be used to assess our environmental footprint more completely than is now possible and opens the door to new forms of democracy, the abolition of banks and other intermediaries, and a new global taxation system based not on our income but our impact on Planet Earth. Supplementary technologies such as ambient computing - always-on, hands-off computing peripherals that allow speech-powered typing and automatic forms of identification - will be premised on a context of permanent activity. Soon, turning on the computer or fishing your phone out of your pocket will no longer be a precondition to being online. Real and virtual escape routes As millions of people - mostly older, unskilled monolinguals - find themselves thrust into a world where they are nothing but surplus or collateral damage in the ongoing technological sprint, they may come to depend on another two, just-round-the-corner innovations to cushion their obsolescence: a Universal Basic Income (UBI) providing participants, whether employed or not, with a guaranteed salary; and the seductively immersive worlds of Virtual Reality (VR). As AI increasingly autonomises formerly human-managed objects like cars and factory assembly lines, it displaces not only millions of workers employed in repetitive jobs like driving and assembling products, writes Athanasiadis [Getty] UBI is already a thing, with trials running on all continents aside from Australia and Antarctica. Switzerland put the idea to referendum last year, but its wealthy citizens rejected it for fear that introducing a guaranteed income would lead to the country being overrun by immigrants. UBI contains several dangers, including the risk of hardening our societies' current inequality into an irreversible orthodoxy, or being used as a pretext to scrap state-provided health services and other forms of welfare. OPINION: Artificial intelligence will delete nationalism Finally, there is VR, the most widely-available of all these technologies. Hailed as a reality-suspending innovation exceeding even the invention of the moving image, it is poised to go mainstream this year.

(24:49) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY But despite the sizzling pace of change, there is no apparent sense of urgency, no panic at how quickly we are hurtling towards our future. Even as we start checking into fully-automated hotels, being transported by driverless cars, and even choosing robots for sexual and spiritual succour, the voices of those questioning how such scarce public debate can mark such momentous innovations appear puny and drowned-out by the digital tumult. Does anyone ask what the social consequences of discarding significant sections of society for being less efficient than robots are? How will those who cannot adapt react to the realisation that, rather than failed individuals, they belong to powerful, potentially disruptive constituencies numbering in the hundreds of millions? What ethical frontiers will humanity trespass upon once the elites can afford to engineer selves or descendants immune to disease and fatigue? Make elections great again As the dominant economic system first shoves millions of people to the margins of society, then sweeps them off its edge, we must recognise that new technologies will be used to radically transform the already dysfunctional way in which we conduct our economic, ecological and electoral affairs: both constructively (Blockchain can replace quadrennial elections and conduct hack-proof referendums on a myriad of issues affecting us) and destructively (the psychological damage caused by absolute immersion into virtual worlds more attractive to their users than their jobless realities; how human psychology is redefined when work is no longer the defining motivation in one's existence; or the potential for AI to autonomously advance in threatening directions to humanity). Virtual Reality is poised to go mainstream this year [Getty] At a time of ecological meltdown, it is worth taking two steps back and questioning whether the planet can sustain eight billion people aspiring to a consumerist lifestyle and an economic system premised on devouring natural resources. How can the extraordinarily powerful technological tools currently in development be leveraged to reduce the inequality that has only increased in the Internet Era, while minimising our impact on the environment? Holding this debate is hardly in the interest of those making wild, tax-free savings by substituting machines for humans. So it's unsurprising that the kind of politicians supported by transnational business lobbies continue misleading their constituencies with feel-good narratives that appeal to two shrivelling realities: national, religious and ethnic identities that are increasingly irrelevant in our globalised world, and the illusory promise of a return to 20th century-style economic health. As long as critical masses of voters continue imbibing narratives of self-actualised, empowered individualism we will not be able to honestly debate what consequences technology is bringing upon us.

Eugene Kaspersky, Chief Executive of Russia's Kaspersky Lab, founded the antivirus company in Moscow in 1997 [Reuters/Maxim Shemetov] The past 10 years have made it clear that the internet - both the software that powers it and the software that runs on top of it - are fair game for attackers. The past five years have made it clear that nobody has internalised this message as well as the global intelligence community. The Snowden leaks pulled back the curtains on massive Five Eyes efforts in this regard, from muted deals with internet behemoths, to amusing grab-all efforts like grabbing still images from Yahoo webcam chats. In response to these revelations, a bunch of us predicted a creeping fragmentation of the internet, as more people became acutely aware of their dependence on a single country for all their software and digital services. Two incidents in the last two months have caused these thoughts to resurface: the NotPetya worm, and the accusations against the Russian antivirus giant Kaspersky Lab. To quickly recap NotPetya: a mundane accounting package called MeDoc with wide adoption (in Ukraine ) was abused to infect victims. Worms and viruses are a dime a dozen, but a few things made NotPetya stand out. For starters, it used an infection vector repurposed from an NSA leak. It seemed to target Ukraine pretty specifically, and it had tangible side effects in the real world (Maersk shipping company reported loss up to $200m due to NotPetya). What interested us most about NotPetya, however, was its infection vector. Having compromised the wide open servers of MeDoc, the attackers proceeded to build a malicious update for the accounting package. This update was then automatically downloaded and applied by thousands of clients. Auto-updates are common at this point and considered good security hygiene, so it's an interesting twist when the update itself becomes the attack vector. The Kaspersky saga also touched on "evil updates" tangentially. While many in the US intelligence community have long looked down on the Russian antivirus company gaining popularity in the US , Kaspersky has routinely performed well enough to gain considerable market share. This came to a head in September this year when the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a directive for all US governmental departments to remove Kaspersky software from their computers. In the days that followed, a more intriguing narrative emerged. {articleGUID} According to various sources, an NSA employee who was working on exploitation-and-attack tooling took some of his work home, where his home computer (running Kaspersky software) proceeded to slurp up his "tagged" files. Like most things infosec, this has kicked off a distracting sub-drama involving Israeli, Russian and US cyberspooks. Kaspersky defenders have come out calling the claims outrageous; Kaspersky detractors claim that their collusion with Russian intelligence is obvious and some timid voices have remained non-committal while waiting for more proof. We are going to ignore this part of the drama completely. What we do care about though is the possibility that updates can be abused to further nation-state interests. The US claim that Russian intelligence agencies were pushing updates selectively to some of its users, turning their software into a massive, distributed spying tool, is completely feasible from a technical standpoint. Kaspersky has responded by publishing a plan for improved transparency, which may or may not maintain their standing with the general public. But that ignores the obvious fact that as with any software that operates at that level, a "non-malicious" system is just one update away from being "malicious". The anti-Kasperskians are quick to point out that even if Kaspersky has been innocent until now, they could well turn malicious tomorrow (with pressure from the GRU) and that any assurances given by the company are dependent on them being "good" instead of there being technical controls. For us, as relative non-combatants in this war, the irony is biting. The same (mostly American) voices who are quick to float the idea of the GRU co-opting Russian companies claim that US-based companies would never succumb to pressure from the US intelligence community, because of the threat to their industry position should it come out. There is no technical control that's different in the two cases; US defenders are betting that the US intelligence agencies will do the "right thing", not only today but also far into the future. This naturally leads to an important question: do the same rules apply if the US is officially (or unofficially) at war with another nation? A single malicious update pushed from Microsoft could cripple almost every government worldwide. During World War II, Germany nationalised British assets located in Germany, and Great Britain did likewise. It makes perfect sense and will probably happen during future conflicts, too. But computers and the internet changed this. In a fictitious war between the US and Germany, the Germans could take over every Microsoft campus in the country, but it wouldn't protect their Windows machines from a single malicious update propagated from the company headquarters in Redmond, Washington state. The more you think about this, the scarier it gets. A single malicious update pushed from Microsoft could cripple almost every government worldwide. What could prevent this? Certainly not technical controls (unless you build a national operating system, as North Korea did). This situation is without precedent. That a small number of vendors have the capacity to remotely shut down government infrastructure, or vacuum up secret documents, is almost too scary to wrap your head around. And that's without pondering how likely they are to be pressured by their governments. In the face of future conflict, is the first step going to be disabling auto-updates for software from that country? This bodes ill for us all. The internet is healthier when everyone auto-updates. When eco-systems delay patching, we are all worse off. When patching is painful, botnet malware like Mirai take out innocent netizens with 620 Gbit/s of traffic. Even just the possibility leads us to a dark place. South Korea owns about 30 percent of the phone market in the US (and supplies components for almost all of them). Chinese factories build hardware and ship firmware in devices we rely on daily. Like it or not, we are all dependent on these countries behaving as good international citizens but have very little in terms of a carrot or a stick to encourage "good behaviour". {articleGUID} It gets even worse for smaller countries. A type of mutually assured technology destruction might exist between China and the US, but what happens when you are South Africa ? You don't have a dog in that fight. You shovel millions and millions of dollars to foreign corporations and you hope like hell that it's never held against you. South Africa doesn't have the bargaining power to enforce good behaviour, and neither does Argentina or Spain, but together, we may. An agreement between all participating countries can be drawn up, where a country commits to not using their influence over a local software company to negatively affect other signatories. Countries found violating this principle risk repercussions from all member countries for all software produced by the country. In this way, any intelligence agency that seeks to abuse influence over a single company's software risks all software produced by that country blocked by all member countries. This creates a shared stick that keeps everyone safer. This clearly isn't a silver bullet. An intelligence agency may still break into software companies to backdoor their software, and probably will. They just can't do it with the company's cooperation. Countries will have a central arbitrator (like the International Court of Justice) that will field cases to determine if intelligence machinations were done with or without the consent of the software company, and like the Geneva Convention would still be enforceable during times of conflict or war. Software companies have grown rich by selling to countries all over the world. Software (and the internet) have become massive shared resources that countries the world over are dependent on. Even if they do not produce enough globally distributed software to have a seat at the table, all countries deserve the comfort of knowing that the software they purchase won't be used against them. The case against Kaspersky makes it clear that the US acknowledges this, as a credible threat and are taking steps to protect themselves. A global agreement protects the rest of us, too.

The names of Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson are displayed during the announcement of the winners of the Nobel Prize in chemistry [TT News Agency/Claudio Bresciani via Reuters] A revolutionary technique dubbed cryo-electron microscopy, which has shed light on the Zika virus and an Alzheimer's enzyme, has earned scientists Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson the Nobel Prize for chemistry. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said on Wednesday that the scientists' ultrasensitive imaging method, called cryoelectron microscopy, enables researchers to "freeze biomolecules" mid-movement. This allows scientists to study molecules in their natural form, without the need for dyes, laying bare never-before-seen details of the tiny protein machines that run all cells. READ MORE: Gravitational wave pioneers win Nobel Physics Prize The "cool microscope technology ... is decisive for both the basic understanding of life's chemistry and for the development of pharmaceuticals," it said. For instance, the academy said the technique was used when scientists began suspecting the Zika virus was causing the epidemic of brain-damaged children in Brazil . Images of the virus allowed researchers to "start searching for potential targets" for Zika drugs. Thanks to the international team's "cool method", which uses electron beams to examine the tiniest structures of cells, "researchers can now freeze biomolecules mid-movement and visualise processes they have never previously seen," the Nobel chemistry committee said on Wednesday. This has been "decisive for both the basic understanding of life's chemistry and for the development of pharmaceuticals", it added. Columbia University professor Joachim Frank [Brendan McDermid/Reuters] Frank, a 77-year-old, German-born biochemistry professor at Columbia University in New York, was woken from his sleep when the committee announced the prize in Sweden 's capital, Stockholm, six hours ahead. "There are so many other discoveries every day, I was in a way speechless," he said. "It's wonderful news." In the first half of the 20th century, biomolecules - proteins, DNA and RNA - were terra incognita on the map of biochemistry.

But 72-year-old Henderson, from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK, used an electron microscope in 1990 to generate a three-dimensional image of a protein at atomic resolution, a groundbreaking discovery which proved the technology's potential. Frank made it widely usable between 1975 and 1986, developing a method to transform the electron microscope's fuzzy two-dimensional images into sharp, 3-D composites. Scientist Jacques Dubochet [Denis Balibouse/Reuters] Dubochet, today an honorary professor of biophysics at the University of Lausanne, in Switzerland , added water. Now 75, he discovered in the 1980s how to cool water so quickly that it solidifies in liquid form around a biological sample, allowing the molecules to retain their natural shape even in a vacuum. READ MORE: Nobel Prize for medicine recognises work on biological clock The electron microscope's every nut and bolt have been optimised since these discoveries. The required atomic resolution was reached in 2013, and researchers "can now routinely produce three-dimensional structures of biomolecules," according to the Nobel committee. The trio will share the prize money of nine million Swedish krona (around $1.1m). "Normally, what I'd do if I was in Cambridge, we will have a party around teatime in the lab, but I expect we'll have it tomorrow instead," said Henderson. The prize announcement was praised by the scientific community and observers around the world. "By solving more and more structures at the atomic level we can answer biological questions, such as how drugs get into cells, that were simply unanswerable a few years ago," Jim Smith, science director at the London-based biomedical research charity Wellcome, said in a statement. Daniel Davis, immunology professor at the University of Manchester, said details of crucial molecules and proteins that make the human immune system function, can now be seen like never before. "It has been used in visualising the way in which antibodies can work to stop viruses being dangerous, leading to new ideas for medicines - as just one example," he said. John Hardy, neuroscience professor at University College London, said Dubochet, Frank and Henderson's technique has transformed the field of structural biology. It has been used, for example, to compile a detailed identikit of an enzyme implicated in Alzheimer's. "Knowing this structure opens up the possibility of rational drug design in this area," Hardy said. "And as a biologist, I can say that the pictures are beautiful."

Professor Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar at the University of Chicago (Getty Images) Described as a "child prodigy" and hailed as the first astrophysicist to win the Nobel Prize for a theory on the evolution of stars, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar would have been 107 on Diwali this Thursday. In his honour, Google is changing its logo in 28 countries to a doodle, or illustration, of him and the Chandrasekhar Limit. But in his lifetime, the Indian American astrophysicist was not always recognised for his achievements. This is his story: Intellectual family Born in Lahore in 1910 to a Tamil family, Chandra was home tutored until age 12. In his autobiography, Chandrasekhar referred to his mother as "My mother Sita was a woman of high intellectual attainments." His uncle, Sir CV Raman, won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930. Also in 1930, Chandrasekhar completed his bachelor's degree in physics at the Presidency College in Madras, India (known today as Chennai). Chandrasekhar was then awarded a scholarship by the g overnment of India to pursue graduate studies at the University of Cambridge in the UK . He completed his PhD studies in 1933. Married to Lalitha Doraiswamy in the southern Indian city of Madras, Chandrasekhar praised his wife's "patient understanding, support, and encouragement" and called those the "central facts of my life". Belated recognition Working as a researcher at Cambridge University, Chandrasekhar made his most significant discovery, which became known as the Chandrasekhar Limit. But his colleagues were sceptical of his discovery and sought to discredit it. According to the Open University, English astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington persuaded Chandrasekhar to present his findings at the Royal Astronomical Society in London on January 11, 1935. At the astronomical society, Eddington then gave a lecture to " demolish the young researcher's calculations and theory, dismissing it as mere mathematical game playing". More than 30 years later, in 1966, scientific research with computers and the hydrogen bomb gave credit to Chandrasekhar's calculations. Black holes, central to Chandrasekhar's theory, were identified in 1972. His calculations contributed to the understanding of supernovas, neutron stars and black holes. Security clearance In 1937, Chandrasekhar emigrated to the US and started working at the University of Chicago. During World War II, he was invited to join the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos to make a nuclear bomb, but delays in the processing of his security clearance prevented him from joining. Still, Chandrasekhar contributed to the war effort, working for the Ballistic Research Laboratory in Maryland. In 1953, 16 years after he came to the US, Chandrasekhar was granted US citizenship. He died in Chicago at the age of 85. Quotes In his book, Truth and Beauty, he offered his advice to aspiring scientists, "What a scientist tries to do essentially is to select a certain domain ... and see if that takes its appropriate place in a general scheme which has form and coherence; and, if not, to seek further information which would help him to do that." In his autobiographical sketch for the Nobel Prize ceremony, he described what motivated his scientific quest, "When, after some years of study, I feel that I have accumulated a sufficient body of knowledge and achieved a view of my own, I have the urge to present my point of view, ab initio, in a coherent account with order, form, and structure." In an interview, Chandrasekhar praised the US, "I have one advantage here in the United States. I have enormous freedom. I can do what I want. Nobody bothers me". What a scientist tries to do essentially is to select a certain domain ... and see if that takes its appropriate place in a general scheme" S Chandrasekhar, in his book Truth and Beauty Honours When Chandrasekhar was 43, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. At the age of 56, he was awarded the National Medal of Science for his numerous contributions to stellar astronomy, physics and applied mathematics. At the age of 61, he was honoured with the Draper Medal from the US National Academy of Science for his leadership in, and major contributions to, the field of astrophysics. In 1983, at 73 years of age, Chandrasekhar shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with William Fowler for his "theoretical studies of the physical processes of importance to the structure and evolution of the stars". That is, how shining stars eventually become "black holes" or " white dwarfs" . India Science & Technology United States Asia US & Canada

Alphabet's Project Loon was first launched in 2013 to provide internet service in remote regions [Google] Alphabet Inc, the company that controls Google , is sending special balloons to Puerto Rico to help restore phone service after the island was devastated by Hurricane Maria last month. The US Federal Communications Commission said it had approved the company's application to provide the emergency cellular service to Puerto Rico. In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico has struggled to regain communications services. The FCC said on Friday that 83 percent of cell sites remain out of service, while wireless communications company are deploying temporary sites. Alphabet, which announced its Project Loon in 2013 to use solar-powered, high-altitude balloons to provide internet service in remote regions, said in an FCC filing it was working to "support licensed mobile carriers' restoration of limited communications capability" in Puerto Rico. Earlier on Friday, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced he was forming a Hurricane Recovery Task Force with an emphasis on addressing challenges facing Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. "It is critical that we adopt a coordinated and comprehensive approach to support the rebuilding of communications infrastructure and restoration of communications services," Pai said in a statement. Separately, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said in a Twitter posting late on Friday that he had a "great initial conversation with @elonmusk tonight. Teams are now talking; exploring opportunities. Next steps soon to follow." Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc, said on Friday the company would send more battery installers to Puerto Rico to help restore power after Hurricane Maria knocked out all power on the island over two weeks ago. Musk said he was diverting resources from a semi-truck project to fix Model 3 bottlenecks and "increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas". In late September, Tesla said it was sending hundreds of batteries that can store power generated by solar panels to Puerto Rico to provide emergency help in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

The winners were announced during a ceremony in Stockholm [TT News Agency/Jessica Gow via Reuters] US astrophysicists Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne have been awarded the Nobel Prize for physics for their pioneering role in the detection of gravitational waves. Predicted by Albert Einstein more than 100 years ago as part of his theory of general relativity, but only detected in 2015, gravitational waves are "ripples" in the fabric of space-time caused by violent processes, such as colliding black holes or the collapse of stellar cores. Scientists say the detection of gravitational waves will open a new window on the universe. READ MORE: Einstein's gravitational waves detected by scientists "This is something completely new and different, opening up unseen worlds," the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in a statement announcing the winners of the nine million Swedish krona ($1.1 million) award. "A wealth of discoveries awaits those who succeed in capturing the waves and interpreting their message." Weiss won half the prize, with Barish and Thorne sharing the other half. Weiss uses a visual aide to discuss the detection of gravitational waves, [File: Gary Cameron/Reuters] First-ever direct observation The three scientists cocreated the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) at the prestigious California Institute of Technology, which has taken home 18 Nobels since the prizes were first awarded in 1901. The first-ever direct observation of gravitational waves was made in September 2015 at LIGO, the result of an event some 1.3 billion light years away. Since then, the enigmatic ripples have been detected three more times: twice more by LIGO and once by the Virgo detector located at the European Gravitational Observatory (EGO) in Cascina, Italy. "Gravitational waves spread at the speed of light, filling the Universe, as Albert Einstein described in his general theory of relativity. They are always created when a mass accelerates, like when an ice skater pirouettes or a pair of black holes rotate around each other," the Nobel jury said. "Einstein was convinced it would never be possible to measure them. The LIGO project's achievement was using a pair of gigantic laser interferometers to measure a change thousands of times smaller than an atomic nucleus, as the gravitational wave passed the Earth." Physics is the second of this year's crop of Nobel Prizes and comes after Americans Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young were awarded the Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine on Monday. The prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were first awarded in 1901 in accordance with the will of Swedish business tycoon Alfred Nobel, who bequeathed much of the fortune he generated from his discovery of dynamite.

RenderPagesVideo('5550457418001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); There is something romantic about being out on the remote steppes of Mongolia . Flaming sunsets burst across the vast plains with their endless views. Wild horses gallop past, kicking up trails of dust. Together with the 101 East film crew, I am headed east in a four-wheel drive to the home of a nomadic herder named Bilguungerel, also known as Billy. The road ended two hours ago and there are no signs, landmarks or internet to guide us here, but we keep going. The isolation feels like freedom. "How far away?" I ask our local guide. "Oh, very near." I try again. "How long till we reach them?" "Maybe five more hours. Why do you like to be so precise? We are not used to that," the guide says, laughing. Time and space are treated differently here. It's difficult to stick to a schedule. We spend the next 10 days sharing the ger - a round tent traditionally used by nomadic families in Central Asia - occupied by Billy, his wife and three children. We follow Billy on his daily chores, tending to his herds of horses and goats. I wonder how the family feels about having a whole crew of outsiders suddenly descend on their lives. Billy's family wake and sleep with the sun and the summer days are long. It has been exceptionally dry this year so they have to work hard to feed and water the herds. Billy owns 200 horses which roam wild on the steppes. "We love our horses, they are our friends," Billy explains. Five of them are especially dear to him and are never far from sight: they're his race horses which he has been preparing for this year's Naadam festival. The horse races at the festival are a celebration of thousands of years of Mongolian tradition and there's a lot of pride riding on the event. This year, Billy's five-year-old son, Babu, will make his debut as a jockey. Every morning and evening, father and son are out on the steppes training the horses on 20-kilometre runs. Babu rides, with his father following beside him on a small motorbike. After months of preparation, the big day is just a week away. Billy owns 200 horses which roam wild on the steppes [Sarah Yeo/Al Jazeera] ' If he lasts the night, he will live' One day, the hot and arid weather takes a drastic turn. The rain doesn't stop. That night, as temperatures plummet, a horse becomes ill. Outside, under the full moon, it is freezing. The sick horse is writhing on the ground, a pool of blood beside it. Billy pours two cups of vodka and holds them below the horse's nostrils. He tells me that the fumes help to stir the horse. The children huddle around the animal, watching intently. No one speaks and the wind is deafening. When there is nothing more to be done, they get up and go inside. "If he lasts the night, he will live," Billy says. The mood is sombre, but more accepting than sad. Billy expects that half of his livestock will die this coming winter, when temperatures will drop to -40 degrees Celsius. This is the harsh reality of life on the steppes. Faced with mortality, I am reminded of the remoteness of our whereabouts. The next family lives more than an hour's drive away. The distance to the nearest town, where the family buys fuel and water, is similar. There is a hill nearby that the family can hike up to get a phone signal to make calls. We are hours from the nearest hospital. The next morning, we find the young horse survived. Days later, the weather improves, just in time for Naadam. Dressed in their Sunday best, the family heads out to the festival to watch Babu's first race. He's excited, but it's a heart-stopping event. Competing against more than 60 riders, the young jockey's feet slip from the stirrups. We watch from the car with Billy as he drives alongside the 24-kilometre open track. Anxious, Billy calls out to his son. Babu does well among the pack and comes in sixth. He's proud of himself, and so is his family. That afternoon we say our goodbyes in the family's makeshift tent at the festival site. Plates of deep fried pastry and bowls of vodka make the rounds. It's a celebration and everyone is in good spirits. We pass the breathtaking landscape on the long drive back to the capital, Ulaan Baatar. This time, I have seen enough to know that life on the Mongolian steppe is not all that romantic - but the reality is even better. Watch Mongolia: Born to Ride on 101 East.

RenderPagesVideo('5550457418001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Khentii Province, Mongolia - "I miss everything about him. I ask why I kept sending him to race and why we taught him to ride a horse," says P Batsaikhan, whose son, Lkhagvadorj, was seven years old when he died. The boy was competing in an ancient tradition in Mongolia - racing horses at top speed on the country's vast steppes. These horse races are some of the longest in the world. And have some of the youngest child jockeys. When Lkhagvadorj fell, he was trampled by the horses. He wasn't wearing a helmet, and his skull was crushed. His father, S Baasandorj, had been waiting for him at the finish line. "I rode as fast as I could to the hospital. When I got there, he had died. I sat next to my son for an hour in silence," he recalls. Mongolia is the birthplace of Genghis Khan, who founded an empire on horseback. Today, horses remain a symbol of the nation's sovereignty and spirit. This culture is celebrated every year at Naadam, the country's biggest festival. As part of the celebrations, hundreds of horse races are held across the nation, keeping an ancient tradition alive. Mongolian law states that children must be at least seven years old to compete in horse races. But Al Jazeera found riders as young as five - riders like Babu. "I like galloping very fast. Racing is the best," he says. Babu is one of an estimated 30,000 Mongolian child jockeys. He is so small that he needs his father to hoist him into the saddle. But after months of training, he's about to compete in his first race. With 80 other jockeys, Babu will ride one of his father's stallions along a 24km, unmarked dusty track. He's raring to go. "I like to ride a horse and I like to win," he explains. Mongolian law states that children must be at least seven years old to compete in horse races. But Al Jazeera found riders as young as five [101 East/Al Jazeera] Child labour The International Labour Organization calls this ancient sport a dangerous form of child labour. In the past five years, 1,500 child jockeys have been injured and 10 have died in horse races across the country, according to figures from the Ulaan Baatar Traumatology Hospital. Dr P Bayarsaikhan is a trauma surgeon at the hospital. He has treated injured child jockeys. "It's considered a serious injury when it comes to us," he explains. "We feel very emotional because it involves children." Despite laws requiring children to wear protective gear, many children compete without helmets. Bayarsaikhan says this lack of safety equipment means that head injuries are common among those who fall, leaving some riders with long-term brain injuries. He says child jockeys are unable to accurately assess hazards while riding, leading them to take dangerous risks. Tsanlig Battuya, spokesperson for the group The National Network Against The Worst Forms of Child Labour , believes child jockeys are often exploited, with children from poor families sometimes pushed into the sport. "What we are trying to say is to keep the children away from exploitation - not because we don't want them to ride a horse. We are trying to protect their rights and safety," she says. In the past five years, 1,500 child jockeys have been injured and 10 have died in horse races across the country [101 East/Al Jazeera] New laws A law requiring jockeys to wear helmets was introduced in 2011. But Oyungerel Tsedevdamba, the former m inister of culture, sports and tourism, claims only Naadam races are regulated. This means trainers are free to ignore safety guidelines in private races outside the festivities. If a trainer is judged to be responsible for a jockey's death, the maximum penalty is an $8,000 fine. Tsedevdamba says this is insufficient, and is calling for tougher penalties. No one has gone to jail so far for a child's death in a horse race ... It's a big problem because no one was sued and the state never prosecuted anyone for a child's death Tsedevdamba, former minister of culture "No one has gone to jail so far for a child's death in a horse race ... It's a big problem because no one was sued and the state never prosecuted anyone for a child's death," Tsedevdamba explains. With some jockeys dropping out of school to race and train full-time, Tsedevdamba says they struggle to find work once they become too old to race. "They aren't educated … so that's another problem," she explains. But in a country where horse racing and the political establishment are closely linked, activists question whether there is the political will to properly regulate the industry. Earlier this year, Al Jazeera found that Mongolian parliamentarians owned 654 racehorses. With few voices in Mongolia calling for a complete ban on child jockeys, the tradition looks set to continue. "If we are pushed to take the children completely off the horseback it will be non-Mongolian," says Tsedevdamba. "I think every Mongolian would want to make their children learn to ride horses … we have to draw a line between what is a traditional race and where we have to stop our children." For five-year-old Babu, horse racing offers the chance to prove himself in one of the toughest races in the world. "I want to win a prize during Naadam," he says. For his father, it's about continuing a proud family tradition, which dates back thousands of years. "It's like we become one with the horse. It's in our blood. The bond is there," he says.

Members of the Detroit Lions take a knee during the singing of the national anthem [Rey Del Rio/Getty Images] Over the last week, US President Donald Trump lashed out at players who have been taking a knee during the customary national anthem at NFL games. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5550033052001, 0, 0, 330, 186, "bcvid_5550033052001"); brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: Taking a stand by bending a knee: How Colin Kaepernick started a movement (2:42) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY While speaking in the US state of Alabama on September 22, Trump decried the protests, calling for National Football League (NFL) owners to fire "any son of a b****" who "disrespects our flag". The following day, many NFL players knelt during the national anthem, which is known as the "Star-Spangled Banner". Terrell Suggs of the Baltimore Ravens and Mike Evans of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were among those who knelt last Sunday. Others locked arms in a show of solidarity and unity, while some avoided the ceremonies altogether by remaining in the locker rooms until they concluded. An estimated 200 people participated in some form of protest last Sunday, prompting Trump to post a series of tweets that criticised those who knelt and called on the NFL to create policies that require players to stand during the anthem. The protests - known as #TakeAKnee on social media - were started by Colin Kaepernick, former quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers. During a preseason game in 2016, Kaepernick sat down during the national anthem rather than stand. In an interview after the game, Kaepernick explained that he chose to sit in protest of the ongoing police killings of people of colour, particularly black Americans. "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of colour," he said. "To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder." READ MORE: Will killings by police rise in Trump's America? Kaepernick's protests prompted both widespread solidarity and public outrage. While many celebrated his decision, others deemed him a "traitor" and accused him of dishonouring the country. The protests spread throughout the NFL, as well as to other sports, including professional basketball and baseball. Al Jazeera has broken down a handful of the most interesting and compelling analyses of Trump's comments about the NFL protests. 'This was never about the national anthem' At The Root, Michael Harriot argues that the anger from right-wing Americans, among them Trump, was not about the national anthem at all. Harriot maintains that the outrage is actually rooted in a lack of understanding regarding protests, the potential loss of money and power for the sports industry and an inability to accept black Americans fighting back against institutional racism and discrimination. The outrage over Kaepernick from unmelanated America was about a lot of things. It was about the dog-whistle of 'patriotism' and 'America first.' It was about America's continuing love for the game of 'See No Racism, Hear No Racism.' It was about riling up the flag-wavers as a force to oppose the habitual line steppers.But it was never about the anthem. Michael Harriot, The Root NFL owners 'biggest hypocrites yet' Writing at The Intercept, columnist Shaun King argues that Trump is attempting to divert attention from the ongoing crisis in Puerto Rico, which left millions without electricity, by attacking protesting NFL players in the same way the league's wealthy executives already have been. He points to Kaepernick's ostracisation by the NFL and his inability to be hired by any team. King says the NFL owners have effectively banned Kaepernick over his protests, and argued that they are hypocrites for joining the protesting athletes after Trump's comments last week. Never mind that Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady, the two best quarterbacks in the game, say Kaepernick should be in the league. Never mind the fact that some teams are still winless with quarterbacks who are struggling through every single quarter. Before Trump said a single word in Alabama, those teams had already shut Kaepernick out. Shaun King , The Intercept, 'Don't let Trump make the protests about him' Treva Lindsey, writing at Cosmopolitan, argues that Trump's attack on protesting athletes has been much more forceful than his disavowals of the deadly "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia last month. After a participant of the white supremacist rally allegedly drove his car into a crowd and killed an anti-racist activist, Trump was later criticised for what many viewed as an unconvincing condemnation of the far right. The protests started by Kaepernick were about pushing for equity, equality and justice in American society, while the Charlottesville rally promoted white supremacy and racism, Lindsey writes, arguing that Trump was more offended by the former than the latter. By attacking black protestors more forcefully than he did white supremacists or neo-Nazis, Trump only reinforces what Kaepnernick has been protesting all this time - the legacy and reality of racism in this country. And the president's insistence that the issue of kneeling had nothing to do with race further illustrates that he doesn't get it. #TakeAKnee pushes for a nation in which life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all is a reality and not a lofty ideal crafted by white slaveholding men. And of course, it is impossible to not note the hypocrisy of people like Trump who demonise those kneeling as unpatriotic but promote the slogan 'Make America Great Again,' an assertion that America is not already great. Treva Lindsey, Cosmopolitan 'Nothing is sacred anymore' Michael Starr Hopkins, writing at The Hill, maintains that Trump is responsible for politicising American football in a populist attempt to avoid conversations about his policies. Hopkins says that the protests have sparked a necessary public conversation about militarised policing and police brutality in African American communities, which is a subject Trump wants to suppress. The president said nothing of the constitutional protections that afforded the numerous football players the constitutional right to kneel down in protest. Trump said nothing of the civil rights pioneers like Martin Luther King, Muhammad Ali or Rosa Parks, whose silent protest led to the same gains that Kaepernick and his fellow protesters intend to expound upon. Instead, Trump used our soldiers, who have bravely given their lives and had their caskets draped with the American flag, as a political prop. Michael Starr Hopkins, The Hill 'Our protest is still being misconstrued as disrespectful' Eric Reid, a fellow NFL player and former teammate of Kaepernick, explains in the New York Times why he joined Kaepernick in his protest against police brutality. Reid says that he and Kaepernick wanted to use their platforms as professional athletes to a shine light on the crisis of police brutality in communities of colour and "speak for those who are voiceless". I refuse to be one of those people who watches injustices yet does nothing. I want to be a man my children and children's children can be proud of, someone who faced adversity and tried to make a positive impact on the world, a person who, 50 years from now, is remembered for standing for what was right, even though it was not the popular or easy choice.

Sri Lankan cricket captain Thisara Perera shakes hands with Pakistani cricketer Mohammad Hafeez [Aamir Qureshi/Getty Images] Lahore, Pakistan - The sense of excitement was palpable on this warm, smoggy evening as cricket fans queued for hours outside Gaddafi Stadium i n Pakistan's Lahore . Despite the long lines, people of all ages waited patiently for their security cards to be checked before entering the stadium to watch the highest-profile international cricket match in eight years. In 2009, the convoy of the Sri Lankan national team was attacked by 12 gunmen in Lahore while heading to the stadium. The attack left eight people dead and seven players wounded. Since then, no major Test-playing nation went to Pakistan due to security concerns. Zimbabwe briefly toured the country in 2015. On Sunday, the returning Sri Lankan team received a hero's welcome - despite some of its major players pulling out of the match. Government officials and cricket fans took to social media to thank the Sri Lanka players, while banners seen all across the city welcomed them to Lahore. Inside the stadium, fans held posters and waved Sri Lankan flags as the teams entered the stadium. The match took place against the backdrop of a large security operation. More than 10,000 security forces were deployed and Lahore was put on lockdown - all in order to prove that international cricket could once again be played in front Pakistan's passionate fans. Pakistan scored a 36-run T20 victory over Sri Lanka, but this was a match where the result was only a small part of the equation. Al Jazeera spoke to cricket enthusiasts and spectators about what the match meant to them and the country: Ali Hamdani I can't tell you how happy I am to be here. I missed the last series here because I couldn't find a ticket to buy. But it's like a dream come true seeing international cricket, back in Pakistan, with my own eyes. Spectators hold placards during the T20 international cricket match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka [Mohsin Raza/Reuters] Malik Samiullah You can just feel the excitement in the air right now. We had almost lost hope for any more gatherings like this in Lahore. But the Sri Lankan team has done us a great favour. Wajahat Saeed Khan It's finally here, the big moment. I'm not a cricket fan, but I do believe in Pakistan. I must say that all of Pakistan wasn't quite there over the last few years because cricket was missing. Pakistan's cricket team celebrates after winning the third and final T20 cricket match against Sri Lanka [Aamir Quereshi/Getty Images] But it's back. We're back in form. We're back in shape. Special thanks to Sri Lanka - what awesome people you are. Because you've made us complete again. Bless you for coming to Pakistan, and bless you for playing the champions game in a tough country, making us whole again. Farah First of all, I want to welcome the Sri Lankan team to Pakistan after eight years, and it's brought back the entertainment and fun to our stadium. We were coming to see the matches eight years ago, and every match of Pakistan's since, I haven't missed since. It's my prayer that this keeps going on and Pakistan is now a safe place. We have proved that now, every team that wants to play with us should come here and we will welcome everyone. We are very, very excited to be here. Afia Salaam There are no words to describe my happiness at seeing international cricket back in Pakistan. We are a cricket-crazy country .. It is the only binding force, and almost an alternate religion. What can one say to Sri Lanka except a huge "thank you". Pakistan's players celebrate after winning the third and final T20 cricket match against Sri Lanka [Aamir Queshi/Getty Images] I know Pakistan also stood by them during the times the country was wracked with violence and other teams were willing to forfeit their matches rather than go there for the World Cup. However, what happened to them here in Pakistan was horrific. It made us a pariah state in the cricket world, yet they are the first ones to end our isolation so one cannot be grateful enough. Ahmer Naqvi I have very mixed emotions about the situation. As a Pakistani fan,it is obviously heartening to see fans inside Gadaffi Stadium again. You can see the impact it has on the team, on how well they perform, and it's an important, integral part of our culture. As a Pakistani citizen, and I think this opinion of mine trumps the previous one, I am not in favour of cricket returning into the country, because personally I feel it is immoral that we continue to have terrorist attacks. We continue to have security issues, we continue to have hate speech in the country. A Pakistani soldier stands guard outside the Gaddafi Stadium [Mohsin Raza/Reuters] We have such an existential crisis which continues to take lives of Pakistanis. So much of our security apparatus is diverted to provide security [for such an event]. And I understand that it is necessary and it's a very difficult decision to take. I sympathise with the Pakistan cricket board, I don't think they have much less of an option. They are making the best of a situation. But as a citizen, I do have my misgivings about the prioritisation of cricket over the security of many of our countrymen and areas of our country. Finally, I think it is very important to acknowledge the Sri Lankan cricket team and board and the nation in general. I don't think cricket would have survived in Pakistan after the 2009 terrorist attacks if it hadn't been for Sri Lanka.

The overturn of FIBA's hijab ban is about the visibility and merit of sports professionals who happen to dress modestly, writes Munu [AP] As I am sure most of us know by now, discussions around the hijab are a staple food for the media and the general public, and most of the time, for all the wrong reasons, which do not merit regurgitation. But if there is a good reason for one who dons it to reflect upon the latest controversy, it comes with the recent overturning of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) ban on Muslim women wearing the hijab while playing basketball. Had it been a story detailing the ban of the veil by a Muslim or a non-Muslim majority country or the listings of a commentator who deems a polyester or viscose item as an affront to Western civilisation, most Muslim women would have probably licked their fingers and turned the page. Why? Because the discourse on the real experiences of Muslim women - a discourse that does not present them as "victims" - has moved at a snail's pace. As Love in a Headscarf author, Shelina Janmohamed, says "It feels like no one is listening". That no one seems to be listening does not necessarily mean that hijab-wearing Muslim women should seek overt validation in what can be a very personal choice. It is about the appreciation that a piece of scarf is not the be-all-end-all of who and what the Muslim woman represents. Earlier this month, an iron gate was broken down in the arena of basketball. Hijab is not an obstacle for Muslim athletes Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5352139380001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5352139380001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: Nike taps into growing Muslim market with new sports hijab (1:25) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY On May 4, FIBA, in its first ever mid-term congress, overturned a ban on a whole variety of headgear such as hijabs, turbans and yarmulkes and allowed these items to be worn during basketball games. Prior to this, the organisation had revised its rulings on the headgear rule in September 2014, with exceptions granted at the national level as part of a two-year testing period. The FIBA took this decision because it believed that its previous policies relating to headwear were incompatible with traditional dress codes including the hijab. Indeed, this ban has caused several Muslim women teams to miss out on playing in many arenas. The FIBA's central board approved the proposal to reverse the ban, stating that the new rules will take effect in October this year. In a statement , the organisation said that the new regulation on headgear is "developed in a way that minimizes the risk of injuries as well as preserve consistency of the colour of the uniform". OPINION: Hello and welcome to the hijabi Olympics At surface level, this demonstrates that hijab can be adapted and readapted in multiple situations within public life. But more crucially, this decision also demonstrates that hijab is not an impediment to the social and cultural standing of Muslim women or women who choose to dress modestly. FIBA's decision to revise its headgear rules is a big win for activists and sportswomen who have been tirelessly fighting to make this fact known. There is no doubt there is still a long way to go for Muslim women in some Muslim countries to acquire full civil participation - hopefully, this repeal will be one of many stepping stones to achieve this. Bilqis Abdul Qadir, an exceptional young woman and a college basketball player whose accomplishments had been acknowledged by former US President Barack Obama , was one of the sportswomen impacted by the ban. She made history by being the first Division One basketball player to wear the Muslim veil, but the earlier FIBA ban blocked her chances of going into professional basketball. This conundrum had its toll, culminating in her creating a documentary in 2016 entitled "Life without Basketball". In the short documentary, Bilqis said, "It's hard being a young Muslim woman in America. It takes strength to walk outside and look different than anyone else … They have this stereotype, that they [Muslim women] are quiet and they're submissive … when I play basketball, I worry about nothing … but now it's just a huge question mark." Participating in society For Muslim girls and women like Bilqis, this conversation actually extends beyond the scope of the veil. It is about all females being afforded the opportunity and privileges akin to their respective societies. It is about women who dress modestly and adhere to religious dress not to have their religiosity as a marker which prevents them from fully participating in society. OPINION: Sexy veils, running shoes and missing feminisms British Sudanese basketball player, Asma Elbadawi, who is also a coach and a spoken word poet, has also campaigned to overturn FIBA's hijab ban. In reaction to the repeal of the ban, she told me, "I could see this day coming mainly because other sport governing bodies have already relaxed their rules regarding their religious attire. However, it was a thought, so for it to have manifested into a reality is an indescribable feeling." Elbadawi thinks that it's important for Muslim girls to have positive role models in an area that they may not feel they can carve potential for themselves in. She says , "Since basketball is one of the most popular sports right now, there is scope for Muslims to be seen in a different light and show their willingness to integrate into society." I would go further and say that Muslim women have, for the most part, integrated in and contributed to both Western and non-Western societies, across different periods and places. It is about visibility and real representation on all levels - not only in sporting circles, but in other areas of life. There is no doubt there is still a long way to go for Muslim women in some Muslim countries to acquire full civic participation - hopefully, this repeal will be one of many stepping stones to achieve this. Sport has always been an arena for great social and political change, and while FIBA would argue that the original ban was down primarily to health and safety on the part of participants, its overturn is no less significant. It is about the visibility and merit of sports professionals who happen to dress modestly. It is about basketball doing hijab, because it can.

Lilesa shows his solidarity with the Oromo people after crossing the finish line at the 2016 Rio Olympics [Reuters/Athit Perawongmetha] My name is Feyisa Lilesa. I am an exiled marathon runner from Ethiopia . I have not been back to my country since winning a silver medal at the Rio Olympic Games last August. In Rio, as I approached the finish line, I crossed my wrists above my head in solidarity with the men, women and children who have died fighting for their rights and those who are still suffering under the brutal regime in Ethiopia. It was a sign of nonviolent resistance used by protesters in my native Oromia region, the largest of Ethiopia's nine ethnic-based states. Much has changed since my Olympic protest in Rio. I now live and train in exile in the United States . Last February, I was reunited with my wife and two children. Meanwhile, despite the global spotlight my protest attracted, the killings, imprisonment and harassment of my people by Ethiopian security forces have only worsened. This is why I continue to protest, after every race and at every media event.

PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY In a few days, the World Health Organization (WHO) member states will elect a new director general at the 70th World Health Assembly. One of the top three candidates is Tedros Adhanom, current special adviser to the Ethiopian prime minister and Ethiopia's former foreign and health minister. Adhanom is travelling the world discussing human rights (while comically admitting Ethiopia's record is " not perfect ") as part of his campaign to lead WHO. Adhanom is one of the chief architects of Ethiopia's repressive regime. He has been a cabinet minister for more than a decade. In 2015 and 2016, according to human rights organisations, security forces killed hundreds of peaceful protesters; the number in my opinion might be more than 1,000. Adhanom, then the country's foreign minister, downplayed the extent of the problem and denounced even the scant international scrutiny of Ethiopia's human rights record. In an op-ed last October, Adhanom targeted Human Rights Watch - blaming the New York-based nonprofit and the Ethiopian diaspora for whipping up anti-government protests. Having systematically decimated domestic opposition, the civil society and independent press, his regime was attempting to intimidate and silence critics abroad. Like the government he served, which spends millions of dollars on lobbying to shore up international support, Adhanom has turned to PR agencies to whitewash his image. Adhanom is now travelling around the world hypocritically talking about health as a human right. But when he was health minister, his office refused to acknowledge large cholera outbreaks which cost many lives. Today Ethiopia is also covering up yet another cholera outbreak, using the euphemism of acute watery diarrhoea . Adhanom has also been touting his success with Ethiopia's national Health Extension Program. I have friends who worked as extension workers and know communities that were supposed to benefit from this much-hyped initiative. Particularly in Oromo areas, the services never reached the people who needed them the most. OPINION: The Oromo protests have changed Ethiopia In some towns, poorly supplied health centres were built and extension workers with 10th grade education - who had only a year of medical training - were assigned to staff the facilities. However, the poor training, the distance the workers had to travel to get to the satellite offices and the lack of medical equipment and supplies meant the majority still don't have access to quality health services. Moreover, admission into the programme requires party membership and mandatory political indoctrination . In other words, Adhanom's health ministry used the donor-funded health extension programme as a coercive political recruitment tool for the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). In some cases, people were denied access or were asked to join EPRDF in order to access even the measly services provided by extension workers.

Ethiopia has gained international praise for reaching the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. However, in Oromia today, babies often still die in great numbers from preventable diseases such as diarrhoea. The true child mortality rate is never recorded since the statistics are falsified with the aim of meeting global development goals and keeping foreign aid coming. This practice has so far escaped international scrutiny given the lack of independent press, organised opposition and robust civil society in Ethiopia. After years of authoritarian backsliding, Ethiopia is now effectively a military state, ruled by a Command Post that was set up to oversee the country's now eight-month-long state of emergency, declared in October. Despite these crimes, there is still an opportunity for Adhanom and the Ethiopian regime to do the right thing. First, the martial law must be immediately lifted and protesters, journalists, opposition leaders and civil society members must be released from jail. Specifically, Oromo opposition leaders Bekele Gerba, Merera Gudina and their colleagues must be released without further delay. Authorities must also allow independent investigation, including by UN special rapporteurs on torture and assembly, into human rights violations and the killings of protesters. Second, instead of blaming the diaspora and neighbouring countries for the deepening political crisis, authorities must meet the protesters' demands for a free and fair Ethiopia. That entails opening up the political environment and allowing the country's 100 million citizens to elect their leaders - ending the hegemony of Adhanom's Tigrayan ethnic group. Finally, Adhanom - still a special adviser to the Ethiopian prime minister - must withdraw from the election for director general of the WHO and issue a formal apology to the Ethiopian people, the African Union and human rights groups for trying to divert attention from the crimes he and his government have committed over the past two and a half decades. International civil society groups, the media and WHO member states face a unique opportunity to send a clear message that human rights matter. And perpetrators and enablers of atrocious crimes cannot be rewarded for their complacency in the face of egregious rights abuses. Member states must reject Adhanom's candidacy and demand that Ethiopia stops covering up water-borne diseases and be transparent about its record of child mortality and other key indicators. I look forward to one day returning home to run across the blood-red soil of my homeland. However, until the Oromo people gain their freedom, I will continue to protest in solidarity.

Megan Rapinoe, a member of the women's national team, took a knee during the national anthem to protest because she felt that her liberties as a gay athlete were not protected in the US [AP] US Soccer has long been subject to tensions between its more nativist, nationalist impulses and more liberal, progressive tendencies. That battle may be coming to a head now in the age of Donald Trump as the national federation is taking a political stance in favour of the status quo with its policy banning protests by players during the playing of the US anthem . As expected, all players in the US men's national team respected the policy when the team have played this summer. And in their games since the ban came into force, the women's team have done so, too. Yet, at some level, the US Soccer Federation's decision is an overreaction. There has only been one incident of a player kneeling: last September Megan Rapinoe, a member of the women's national team, took a knee during the national anthem in a game between her club, the Seattle Reign and the Chicago Red Stars in the NWSL, the women's professional football league. She repeated the protest in games for the US national team against Thailand and the Netherlands. OPINION: Blackballing Kaepernick - Fear of the black athlete Rapinoe was, of course, taking her lead from NFL football player Colin Kaepernick who for much of 2016 protested against racism and police brutality in the United States by kneeling during the national anthem. Athletes from a variety of sporting disciplines and levels (from high school to professional) followed suit. As a gay athlete, Rapinoe felt that her liberties were not protected in the US, and also stressed the importance of having "white people stand in support of people of colour on [police brutality]". Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5122033390001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5122033390001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: NFL - Obama defends Kaepernick’s anthem snub (2:06) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Right-wing critics countered with the pervasive delusion that sport and politics are not and should not be mixed, while some liberals contended that athletes who don't stand for the anthem were being disrespectful to the military or anti-American. (With the new season beckoning, Kaepernick, currently without a team, announced he is ceasing his anthem protest, though he wouldn't end his activism on police brutality.) So, the move by US Soccer (as the federation is popularly known) was clearly a direct response to Rapinoe's protest but it was also pre-emptive; a means to censor future protest. The new policy just made explicit the approach US Soccer took in 2016 at the height of the anthem protests when it said it expected players and coaches to stand for the anthem. According to the policy, "all persons representing a Federation national team shall stand respectfully during the playing of national anthems at any event in which the Federation is represented." Rapinoe's protest was clearly not welcomed by US Soccer. Yet, as disappointing as it is that they have chosen to restrict the freedom of expression of players and coaches, we should not be surprised by this development. While other big sports such as American football and baseball tend to be seen as more patriotic and nativist (witness how hard it is for Kaepernick to get a job in the NFL), no other major American sports league - which are all private organisations - has enacted such a restrictive policy. Football as a progressive bastion US Soccer has been rightly criticised, both before and after the release of the new policy, for its double talk (taking a political stance on the issue while pretending to remain neutral). One explanation put forward for US Soccer's stance is that can it afford to be indifferent about police brutality which disproportionately affects black people. Most football players are white, both at amateur level and in the MLS (12 percent of professional players against, for example, the NFL where 70 percent are black). The same goes for women's professional football in the US. In addition, none of US Soccer's board of directors are black, as the football magazine editor George Quraishi has pointed out . READ MORE: LeBron James - Racism is 'part of America' Despite its lack of racial diversity, in the US, football thrives on a media image of "being liberal/progressive/cosmopolitan [because] it's international". During the 2014 World Cup, a poll by YouGov ( PDF ) demonstrated that liberals are more likely than conservatives to be soccer fans. And football has often been attacked by conservatives, including right-wing pundit Ann Coulter's bizarre claim that its growing popularity in the US somehow represents a "sign of the nation's moral decay". So, football tends to be associated with openness and diversity. But this picture of football as a progressive bastion is only partly true. As the writer James Bridget Gordon wrote last year, despite this image "US Soccer is a business". And protesting players are certainly not good for business. Patriotism is. It is also true that a number of team owners are big GOP donors or supporters. In fact, one of the cofounders of MLS and owner of the LA Galaxy, Phil Anschutz , has been associated with financial support for ultraconservative and right-wing causes. Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots and a major booster of Donald Trump, is also owner of the MLS's New England Revolution. And while Rapinoe's own team in the NWSL supported her protest, Rapinoe accused Bill Lynch, owner of the Washington Spirit, of being a homophobe after the team played the anthem before the players took the field in a game against the Reign in order to deny Rapinoe the chance to protest. Reactions to anthem protests and the subsequent ban have tended to focus on whether kneeling is an anti-American act or whether banning protest is a violation of the first amendment. Thirdly, like many other sports in the US, the business of US Soccer has intimate ties to the military. A government oversight report ( PDF ) released in 2015 outlined the more than "$10 million … paid to teams in the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association (NBA), National Hockey League (NHL) and Major League Soccer (MLS)" by the Department of Defense for what the report called "paid patriotism", displays honouring American soldiers. In total eight MLS teams - Seattle Sounders, Colorado Rapids, Real Salt Lake, DC United, FC Dallas, LA Galaxy, Houston Dynamo, and Columbus Crew - received military funding. Beyond this, these and other clubs also regularly host "Military Appreciation Nights". Some of the sport's leading players and personalities have also been guilty of xenophobia . Only three years ago, Bruce Arena, now coach of the men's national team, said "p layers on the national team should be ... Americans. If they're all born in other countries, I don't think we can say we are making progress". To his credit, Arena later changed his tune . Separately, Tim Howard, the longtime number one choice as national team goalkeeper, publicly questioned the "pride" of foreign-born, dual national players (mostly players whose black fathers served the US Army in Germany and started families there with German women.) Abby Wambach, a former teammate of Rapinoe, also backed up Howard's comments . One of the most outspoken supporters of the anthem protest ban is Alexi Lalas, former men's national team member and now a commentator on television. Separately, Geoff Cameron, a member of the US men's national team who plays for Stoke City in the English Premier League, expressed support for President Trump's visa and refugee ban for citizens of seven Muslim majority countries, as well as for the anthem protest ban. Coach Arena has also said he is "very supportive" of the new anthem policy. This xenophobia, which reflects a narrow understanding of who could be American (that designation happens to imply ethnically white, middle-class Americans) coupled with what some have dubbed a " Europhilic American soccer culture" (in which US football culturally and tactically identifies with its supposed English "roots") may explain why US Soccer and MLS has failed to attract Latino American fans to its games. Journalists have pointed to the spectacle of MLS club fans singing xenophobic and violent songs that originate in European leagues, identifying the game with white, suburban culture. OPINION: Far from Sterling - Rebranding racism in sports Nevertheless, to paint US Soccer as a right-wing enterprise would be unfair. Of course, there are still progressive, cosmopolitan, and anti-racist elements within US Soccer but its identity is more complex than the one that is often projected. At the time, Rapinoe said she will respect the policy, but that does not mean that her resistance has ended. It is also the case that US men's captain Michael Bradley and even Arena condemned Trump's immigration ban . But in perhaps the most clarifying moment, only days after Trump was elected president, the US men's national team played Mexico in a World Cup qualifier. During the campaign, Trump had threatened to build a Wall between the two countries and made racist generalisations about Mexicans and Mexican Americans. It helped win Trump the election. Before the match, the two teams posed together for a picture. Mexico won the match, but the symbolism wasn't lost on the participants. Mexican striker, Oribe Peralta, tweeted after the match: "There is no wall that can stop us". Reactions to anthem protests and the subsequent ban have tended to focus on whether kneeling is an anti-American act or whether banning protest is a violation of the first amendment. Yet the issue is arguably deeper than that. It exemplifies the struggle to define the identity of US Soccer, which has so far failed to adequately live up to the progressive image often ascribed to it. The ban was a further step in the wrong direction. Sean Jacobs is associate professor of international affairs at The New School. He founded the website, Africa is a Country .

Pittsburgh Penguins centers Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin hold the Stanley Cup during the Stanley Cup championship parade and rally in downtown Pittsburgh [Charles LeClaire/USA TODAY/Reuters] Professional ice hockey is a white man's sport. Most of the owners are white. Most of the coaches and managers are white. Most of the players are white. Most of the people who pay for an expensive seat to watch a game in an arena are white. Most of the people who watch on TV are white. Most of the reporters who cover the sport are white (and men). Most of the people who work for the world's premier league, the National Hockey League (NHL), are white, including the president. The game is played on white ice. The aim: keep a small, black puck out of your net and put it in the other team's net, that features, of course, white netting. This blizzard of whiteness may be a big part of the reason why last year's Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins, with their white owner, manager, players and star captain, Sidney Crosby, have decided to meet a white president who sees and responds to the world in, well, sinister black and white. OPINION: US Soccer - Not a progressive bastion The Penguins say, in a statement , that they're keeping their promise to meet President Trump on Tuesday at the White House because they're just being polite and respectful. Look, they say, we were polite and respectful to Barack Obama (who is black) when we visited him at the White House after we won the Cup in 2016 and we were polite and respectful to George Bush II (who is white) when we visited him at the White House after we won the Cup in the early 1990s. Those visits, particularly with Obama, make our future visit with Trump sort of cancel each other out, if you know what we mean?

So, stuff it, we're going to shake the guy's hand and pose for pictures with him that we will frame and put up proudly on a wall at home, the office or maybe both. We're only being polite and respectful. That's what hockey players are: polite and respectful. Get it. Oh, and we're humble, too. We're mostly from small towns in Canada , the United States and Europe and we've always been told to respect our elders. Mr Trump is the president of the United States. He's an important man, with an important job. Gee, he's taking time to say: You're hired, not fired! Who are we to say no to Mr President since he's already congratulated our " great team" on Twitter for coming? So what if we're meeting a guy who calls white supremacists in polo shirts carrying tiki torches and making Nazi salutes " very fine people ". So what if those "very fine people" have a long history of hate and have, in the not-so-distant past, enjoyed killing millions of children, women and men in ovens or hanged them from trees because they're black, brown, Jews, Muslims, Roma, homosexuals, sick, or decent people who think racists are scum. Remember, we're just polite and humble hockey players. OPINION: Take a knee for justice: Protest white power! So what if we're meeting a guy who says he likes to "grab" women - like our mothers, wives, sisters and daughters - " by the p**** ". So what if he has allegedly tried to do that with oodles of women and they have reportedly said loudly and clearly no and he didn't take that too well. Remember, we're just polite and humble hockey players. So what if we're meeting a guy who calls Mexicans " rapists " and tries, again and again, to ban people from coming to Pittsburgh or anywhere else in the US because they are Muslim. By the way, like Trump, we don't get to meet a lot of Mexicans or Muslims in our silly line of work. Remember, we're just polite and humble hockey players.

Remember, we're just polite and humble hockey players. So give us a break. OK? We're good guys. Really. Look, we "give back to the community" in many ways. We donate some of the tonne of money we make to help poor kids - white, black and brown. We visit kids in the hospital all the time to make them forget about being sick for awhile. After we visit those kids, we tell reporters: Boy, what a reality check. Do we ever understand now that other people don't have it as good. Man, there's a lot of suffering and injustice. But we don't like to talk about the kind of suffering and injustice all those black football players are taking a knee to expose and do something about. That's "politics". We don't play "politics". It's not our style. Most of us couldn't find Charlottesville, Virginia on a map if we tried and probably don't know who Heather Heyer is. We don't say or do much about that kind of suffering and injustice because, fact is, we're mostly white guys who've never seen, let alone experienced it. ( JT Brown , a black winger with the Tampa Bay Lightning, no doubt, has. That's why he raised his fist in protest during the US national anthem before a tilt on Saturday night in Florida.) Anyway, ever since we've been kids, we've been told to fit in, not stick out. That's the best way to make it to the big leagues. You learn to keep your mouth, eyes and brain shut and just play hockey. What's happening in the real world, to people who don't look like us or come from the same part of the world as us, isn't our worry or bother. Remember, we're polite, humble and white. Like Captain Canada, Sidney Crosby , said: "This isn't [about] us taking a stance". Hey, most of us have never taken a stance about anything other than where to play hockey and for as much money as we possibly can. So, hell yeah, we're going to stand next to Donald Trump - literally and figuratively. You see, he's our kind of guy in more ways than one.

After the Catalan parliament declared independence from Spain on Friday, many have started to question what effect it will have on the future of Catalonia's biggest football club, FC Barcelona. The Spanish Senate responded to the declaration by approving direct rule in the breakaway region. We take a look at what will likely happen to the popular football club the political crisis unfolds. READ MORE: Latest updates of the Catalonia referendum La Liga exit? On October 1, more than two million people, or 90 percent of those who cast a ballot, voted "Yes" to Catalonia breaking away from Spain . The Spanish team joined a countrywide strike early October to protest against "the serious events which took place during the day of the Catalan referendum on independence". On Friday, the Catalan parliament declared independence, leaving the region's future hanging in the air. As developments unfold, FC Barcelona faces the possibility of an exit from La Liga, Spain's national football league. READ MORE: Catalonia independence referendum - All you need to know The team currently sits top of the league rankings and has won 24 La Liga titles. The club's president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, has said during Barcelona's annual general meeting that the club wants to stay in La Liga. "We will never put the club nor its presence in any competition at risk. That's why, to all the socios (members), I say that we want to continue playing in La Liga and, as of today, our participation [in La Liga] is guaranteed," he said according to Reuters. " It's mutually beneficial for La Liga and Barcelona for that link to continue," Bartomeu concluded. Previously, Bartomeu said the club would have to consider the option of leaving the national league in the event of Catalonia's split from Spain. "The situation concerning Barcelona's future in La Liga does not exist so far," he told reporters earlier this month. "But, with regards to what can happen in the future, the board of directors will discuss options." He added: "We will find the best solution. If independence happens, we need to discuss things carefully." Could Barcelona really leave La Liga? Their president says it's possible. pic.twitter.com/M1sjU9N7Lm — Goal (@goal) October 2, 2017 // <![CDATA[ // ]]]] > Football analysts say the only way the four-time European champions can remain in the Spanish league following a secession is if amendments are made to the country's laws. "The sports law and the regulations will have to be changed in the Spanish parliament for Barcelona to be accepted in the Spanish league," Guillem Balague, Spanish football journalist, told Al Jazeera. "T here is no other way for Barcelona to be part of the league after independence." Despite speculations of a possible move to the English Premier League (EPL), experts believe the Catalan team's top priority would be to stay in the Spanish league. Keeping Barcelona in La Liga is also in the interest of the league and the club's archrival, Real Madrid, said Balague. "In the longer term, La Liga without Barcelona would be conceivably too damaging to both the club and the league," said Al Jazeera's sports correspondent Lee Wellings. Other Catalan teams, RCD Espanyol and Girona - both in Spain's first division - also find themselves in the same boat as Barcelona.

Football's governing body cited the 'exceptional complexity and sensitivity' and 'political' nature of the issue [File: Majdi Mohammed/AP] Correction Oct. 27, 2017: A previous version of this article stated that FIFA had postponed its decision on the settlement teams. International football's governing body has announced that it will not take a position on the future of six Israeli football clubs based in illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank . FIFA representatives met in Kolkata, India, on Friday and cited the "exceptional complexity and sensitivity" and "political" nature of the subject. "Given that the final status of the West Bank territories is the concern of the competent international public law authorities, the FIFA Council agrees that FIFA, in line with the general principle established in its Statutes, must remain neutral with regard to political matters," FIFA said in a statement. "Furthermore, it was agreed that any interference by FIFA in the status quo of football in the relevant territories without the consent of the parties concerned might aggravate the situation of football not only in the territories in question, but also in the greater region affected - which would not be in the best interests of the game." As a consequence, the body noted, FIFA would refrain "refrain from imposing any sanctions". It has declared the matter closed. The Palestine Football Association (PFA) had been campaigning FIFA to force the relocation of the clubs since 2015. The clubs are located in settlements considered illegal under international law, which is in breach of FIFA statutes. PFA President Jibril Rajoub previously said that he was not seeking the expulsion of Israel from FIFA, but rather for Israel to abide by international regulations. "We want to stop all football and football-related activity run by the Israeli federation in Palestine's internationally recognised territories," he said. {articleGUID} Speaking about Friday's decision not to take action, Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director of the Middle East division of Human Rights Watch , said: "There should be nothing political about deciding to follow one's own rules. "With today's decision, FIFA has decided to continue sponsoring games in illegal Israeli settlements, in contempt of international law and contrary to its professed commitment to human rights." In a statement, Fadi Quran, a senior campaigner in Palestine for the civic organisation, Avaaz, said that FIFA's failure to act means that thousands of Palestinian children are being "robbed of the chance to play the game they love on land that's theirs." "If FIFA won't do its job and won't respect its own statutes and international law, then the courts will force it to do so," he said. FIFA has postponed the issue at least four times in the past two years, forcing the PFA to take the matter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in May. A special monitoring committee, appointed by FIFA in 2015, was tasked to resolve the issue within a year - but the mandate was extended in October 2016, January 2017 and March 2017. The six teams are based in the Jewish settlements of Kiryat Arba, Givat Zeev, Maale Adumim, Ariel, Oranit and Tomer. SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Palestine Israel FIFA Sport Middle East
The man in charge of Qatar's World Cup preparations has said that a regional blockade against the country poses "no risk" to the football tournament in 2022. Qatar's only land border and its air and sea routes have been cut off for more than four months since Bahrain , Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates launched an economic boycott against Doha. The blockade has forced World Cup organisers to find alternative sources of materials to complete the eight venues that will host the tournament. "We have come under criticism and attack over the years, but we have always faced our critics," Hassan al-Thawadi, secretary general of the Qatar World Cup supreme committee, told The Associated Press news agency on Friday.

"Once the blockade came into play we contacted the main contractors; we put in place alternative supply chains, we sourced alternative materials from alternate suppliers. I'm very happy to say that our project scale is on time and there is no significant impact on our projects. "As of today, we haven't seen a significant impact on the cost.

The change, which was approved in May by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), came into effect on Sunday following a sustained online campaign. Encouraged by the new rules, Muslim women say they are looking to break religious stereotypes through the sport. "It's important because more people will see that Muslim women can play, do play and are willing to play," said Raabya Pasha, a member of the first all-Muslim women's team, the Falcons, in Leicester, UK . "And even if we are covered up, it doesn't stop us from playing," she added. OPINION: When basketball does hijab, because it can The hijab is a headscarf worn by many Muslim women who feel it is part of their religion. Following FIBA's approval in May, basketball players from across the UK came together to form the Falcons. Having quit the sport because of their head covering, some are making a return and are hoping to inspire young girls. "I think we're going to make a big difference," Falcons player Yaquin Drair said. "There are kids that can see us as role models to be able to play basketball." #FIBAAllowHijab The rule change came after a successful two-year-long online campaign that was aimed at overturning the ban. A number of change.org petitions calling for a change to the rule garnered more than 137,000 signatures. Asma Elbadawi, the woman behind the new Falcons team, was also one of the drivers of the social media campaign. She says she is optimistic about the future. READ MORE: Hijab-wearing woman among Apple's new emojis "We might not see it right now, but gradually, in elite sports, we're going to see more Muslim girls in basketball playing with the hijab, in college basketball for example in America, and in places, where basketball is aired," Elbadawi said. She added: "It will make a huge impact because the more people that are seeing women look like them playing, the more impact it will have on the wider community." The rule change, which affects headgear for both men and women, follows the lead of other sports that have in recent years, allowed head coverings and other wear in sport, including football and weightlifting.

Kaepernick began his protest in August of last year [File: AP Photo] American footballers' campaign of protests against police brutality and racism is rippling throughout the United States and sparking demonstrations beyond the National Football League (NFL). With growing anger over right-wing US President Donald Trump's criticism of NFL players who kneel during the customary national anthem at the beginning of games, activists have targeted team owners and politicians with their own demonstrations, and high school and college athletes have also followed suit. On Tuesday, Carl Dix and Linda Solotaire, both members of the RefuseFascism.org activist group, confronted Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones at the Conrad New York Hotel lobby. As the pair shouted at Jones and accused him of upholding white supremacy, the Cowboys owner was whisked away by his security team. Dix, a 69-year-old African American, said he and his fellow protesters had gathered at the hotel to rally against the NFL owners meeting there. They singled out Jones due to the owner's recent threat to bench players who protest during the national anthem. "I told him, 'You are trying to silence and muzzle these NFL protesters is in the tradition of silencing and abusing African Americans in this society,'" Dix told Al Jazeera by telephone. "I have no problem with players taking a knee during these protests. I haven't stood up for the flag since I was in the army nearly 50 years ago," t he military veteran said. "It really tells you something when you have a president who isn't bothered by videos of police shooting black people in the back and unarmed people, but he is bothered when someone protests by silently taking a knee during a national anthem."

On Friday, football players at Midland High School in Michigan, plan to hold a silent protest during the game's national anthem, according to the local M Live news site. Also on Friday, five cheerleaders at Kennesaw State University, a college in Georgia, plan to take a knee out of sight of the stadium's audience during the national anthem. The university barred the cheerleaders from the field until after the anthem following an incident last month when the cheerleaders knelt during the song, according to local media. In Ames, Iowa, high school band players walked out during the national anthem at the football game last Friday night. Last month, Cedric Ingram-Lewis, 16, and Larry McCullough, 18, were kicked off their football team in Crosby, Texas, after protesting racial inequity during the national anthem. Ingram-Lewis had raised his fist, while McCullough took a knee. 'Get that son of b**** off the field' In August 2016, then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sparked widespread protests in the NFL when he knelt during the national anthem to voice his opposition to police brutality that disproportionately targets African Americans. That year alone, police killed at least 1,093 people, according to The Guardian's database, The Counted. Although African Americans comprise roughly 12 percent of the country's population, they were almost a quarter of those killed by police. So far this year, the Killed By Police monitoring group has recorded at least 954 police slayings. After later leaving the 49ers, Kaepernick went through the off-season and training camps periods without being signed by a team. But the protests had already erupted, with players taking a knee during the national anthem for much of the 2016 and 2017 football seasons. {articleGUID} Last month, Donald Trump elicited widespread criticism when he called for NFL owners to fire players who kneel during the anthem, accusing the athletes of disrespecting the American flag and the country's military. Speaking in Huntsville, Alabama, in September, Trump urged NFL owners to fire any player who participates in the demonstrations: "Get that son of a b**** off the field right now, out, he's fired. He's fired," he told a crowd at a campaign-style rally. Trump has denied his comments were motivated by racism, but critics have levelled the accusation nonetheless. "The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race," Trump insisted in a Twitter post following his initial comments. "It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!" On Thursday, the Trump Make America Great Again Committee launched a petition, saying the "president has asked for a list of supporters who stand for the national anthem". The petition came after the NFL commissioner this week refused to punish players who kneel for the anthem. Issac Bailey, a journalist and interim member of the Charlotte Observer editorial board, argued that Trump's attack on the NFL was an attempt to "use the protests as a cudgel to whip up white outrage". "Such attacks always eventually backfire after initially seeming to work," Bailey, who is also James K Batten Professor of Public Policy at Davidson College, told Al Jazeera. "That's what the history of race and the fight for equality tells us," he added. "The spread of [protests] beyond the NFL definitely speaks to its legitimacy, and that some high school players and students have been punished for kneeling shows that this issue is important well beyond the ranks of professional football players." 'Long history' As NFL protests continue to escalate, Daniel Grano, a professor at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, expects the movement to continue to grow. {articleGUID} "The gesture has travelled, and that will probably continue to leak across the boundaries of the NFL," he told Al Jazeera. "I think that is historically unique." Grano, whose research focuses on race, politics and sports, explained that there is a "long history of protest in sports, especially protests at live events". He explained the NFL protests "very clearly fit into that history of using live sporting events as a uniquely public platform". Professional athletes, particularly African Americans, have used professional sports as a platform for social justice activism for decades. Extending gloved hands skyward in racial protest, US athletes Tommie Smith (centre) and John Carlos (right) stare downward during the 1968 Olympic medal ceremony [AP Photo] In 1967, boxer Muhammad Ali used his platform to explain why he refused to serve in the US military's war in Vietnam. "My conscience won't let me go shoot my brother, or some darker people, or some poor, hungry people in the mud for big powerful America," Ali said then. Ali was subsequently sentenced to five years in prison for draft evasion, fined $10,000 and barred from competition for three years. That ruling was later overturned by the US Supreme Court. The next year, as the US was gripped by the Civil Rights movement, gold and bronze medalists T ommie Smith and John Carlos , both African Americans, raised their left fists during the medal ceremony for the 200-metre race competition at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City. In his autobiography, Smith explained that the gesture was intended to be a "human rights salute". More recently, in 2014, players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) violated dress code rules when they wore "I can't breathe" t-shirts - a reference to Eric Garner, an African American who was killed by a police officer that year - during warm-ups. In 2016, competitors in the Women's National Basketball Association, or WNBA, gained national media attention when they donned shirts supporting the Black Lives Matter civil rights movement. As today's protests continue to make waves at every level, activist Carl Dix hopes they will contribute to a wider movement against the Trump administration. "It's very important that people not only support the NFL players but to spread [the protests]," Dix said.

Several San Francisco 49ers players knelt during the performance of the national anthem on Sunday [Eric Risberg/AP Photo] Professional American football players continued their protests against police brutality on Sunday despite ongoing blowback from right-wing US President Donald Trump and other politicians. At least 22 players across the National Football League (NFL) participated in the protests, according to the Associated Press' count. On Monday morning, Trump tweeted his latest in a series of verbal attacks on the protesting athletes, accusing the players of "showing total disrespect" to the country and its flag. Two dozen NFL players continue to kneel during the National Anthem, showing total disrespect to our Flag & Country. No leadership in NFL! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2017 During the San Francisco 49ers-Dallas Cowboys game on Sunday, at least eight players from the 49ers knelt during the anthem, while no player from the Cowboys participated in the protest. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has vowed bench any player on his team who kneels during the customary performance. Dallas' defensive linesman David Irving, however, raised his fist at the end of the game in solidarity with the ongoing protests. Several other players from teams across the league knelt, raised their fists or stayed in the locker room during the anthem. The protest gestures come as Trump and other politicians ramp up their criticism of the campaign against police brutality, which started last year when former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during the anthem. Kaepernick's public stand against police brutality that disproportionately targets African Americans started in August 2016, but it quickly spread throughout the league and has continued to inspire athletes to kneel during the national anthem well into the 2017 season. 'Force the NFL's hand' Trump first entered the public debate over the protests when he urged NFL owners to fire players involved in the protests last month during a campaign-style rally in Huntsville, Alabama. "Get that son of a b**** off the field right now, out, he's fired. He's fired," Trump told the crowd. Although Trump said his comments had "nothing to do with race", critics have argued that the president was motivated by racism and a hope to distract the public from what they describe as policy failures. Issac Bailey, a journalist and interim member of the Charlotte Observer editorial board, argued that Trump's comments have largely backfired. {articleGUID} "I doubt that would have become reality, had Trump not tried to force the NFL's hands; because though the protests had been in place for more than a year, they got a lot more attention because of Trump's tweet," Bailey, who is also James K Batten Professor of public policy at Davidson College, told Al Jazeera. "That forced the NFL's hands. But we shouldn't forget that this began because Colin Kaepernick was courageous enough to take a knee." The NFL protests have spilled over into other athletic arenas, sparking similar demonstrations in college and high school sporting events. Earlier this month, Vice President Mike Pence stormed out of a game between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers when players knelt during the anthem. 'Brand protection' Daniel Grano, a professor who teaches sports, politics and race at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, said that Trump has sought to change the focus of the protests. "The original intent of the protests as Kaepernick began it has become largely obscured," he told Al Jazeera, arguing that there is now "a set of competing interpretations" of the protests. "The subject of race and policing is still very much alive in the minds of the players who continue protesting," he said. "When President Trump chimed in and said the protests were disrespectful to the flag, he was acting upon and advancing a competing interpretation of what the protests were about." Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, held meeting with NFL executives and team owners to discuss the ongoing protests last week in Manhattan. No decisions were regarding a punishment for players who refused to stand during the anthem. The subject of race and policing is still very much alive in the minds of the players who continue protesting. Daniel Grano, professor at University of North Carolina, Charlotte During last week's meeting in New York City, activists confronted the Cowboys owner Jones and accused him of upholding white supremacy by threatening to punish protesting athletes. In 2016, almost a quarter of the 1,093 people by police were African American, although they only comprise some 12 percent of the country's population, according to The Guardian's database, The Counted. Killed By Police, a monitoring group, has recorded at least 969 people killed by police so far in 2017. After Trump's comments in Alabama in September, several team owners joined players on the field for a show of unity. Many of them locked arms with the athletes, while the NFL opted not to fine players who did not amass on the sidelines during the anthem. Grano described the owners' actions as "brand protection". "The owners for a single weekend showed an apparent form of solidarity, but it wasn't related - in my estimation - to the politics of the protest," he said. "It was related to the protection of the brand." SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Racism United States US & Canada US Sports Sport
Tuesday's World Series baseball game in the Dodgers' Stadium in Los Angeles broke all records for heat. It was played at around 40 Celsius, which makes it the hottest game at any venue since the series began in 1903. The US National Weather Service reported that there has been "another record-breaking hot day across southwest California on Tuesday, with nine records broken, including Downtown Los Angeles which broke a 108-year-old record when they reached 42 degrees". As noted by Weather Underground , (WU), a late-year heat wave really got going on Monday and continued from Santa Barbara through Los Angeles to San Diego. In Orange County, the city of Fullerton soared to 41.7C on Monday. According to WU weather historian Christopher Burt, this is likely the highest single temperature recorded anywhere in the United States so late in the year. Another impressive mark was made in downtown Los Angeles (the University of Southern California campus) where the thermometer hit 39C. Prior to Monday, the downtown station had never topped 38C after October 17, in records going all the way back to 1877. The heat wave and causative Santa Ana winds are being created by a large, near-record-strength dome of high pressure that has settled in over the Great Basin, a few hundred kilometres northeast of Los Angeles. The difference in air pressure between this high-pressure system and lower pressure over Southern California has driven gusty northeast winds over Southern California. Since these winds originated over desert areas, they are hot and dry. A red flag warning (fire danger) has been issued by the National Weather Service, stating that "this event is especially concerning because of the multiple day nature of it, which we have not seen yet this season, and such events have a history of large fires". The average temperature in LA in October is 24C, a figure that will not be revisited until the end of the weekend. SOURCE: Al Jazeera Sport Weather United States US & Canada

Omar Shakouj with his fiancee visiting monuments in Sukhumi [Alice Aedy/Al Jazeera] Sukhumi, Abkhazia - Omar Shakouj remembers the day his family arrived in Abkhazia, a Georgian-claimed breakaway territory on the Black Sea , as they fled the war in Syria. It was supposed to be his ancestral homeland - Shakouj's forebears left the region in the 19th Century - and a warm homecoming in otherwise trying circumstances. Yet, the 24-year-old has one abiding memory from July 5, 2013. "I was in shock," Shakouj recalls. "I asked myself, 'what have I done?'" Since breaking away from Georgia in the early 1990s during a bloody conflict, Abkhazia has gained de facto statehood but not international recognition. Independence came at a high cost, with isolation and economic sanctions inhibiting reconstruction and leaving the picturesque territory dotted with war-damaged infrastructure. Recognised by Moscow in 2008 and a few unlikely allies thereafter, Abkhazia has grown increasingly reliant on Russian aid. When protests in Syria's Damascus transformed into a country-wide conflagration, Abkhazia acted swiftly to bring ethnically Abkhaz Syrians to safety. While European governments dithered over a response to the crisis, Abkhazia's foreign ministry flew approximately 500 refugees on two charter flights from Beirut, Lebanon, to a Russian airport near the Abkhazian border. "I thought it would be like Europe," says Shakouj. Instead, surrounded by bullet-ridden buildings and isolated due to his inability to speak Abkhaz or Russian, he felt despair. In fleeing one warzone, Shakouj had ended up in another - a frozen conflict unresolved 25 years later. A tumultuous past The former Parliament building in Sukhumi, damaged during the civil war with Georgia [Alice Aedy/Al Jazeera] The history of Abkhazia has long been one of turmoil. In the early 1800s, Tsar Alexander brought Ottoman-ruled territory on the northern shores of the Black Sea into the Russian Empire. Over the following decades, Muslim Abkhaz and related ethnic groups from across the region were forcibly exiled to the Middle East. The Circassian genocide, as it is labelled by some , is believed to have left almost one million dead. "Towards the end of the nineteenth century, thousands of Abkhazians had to leave their motherland," Abkhazia President Raul Khajimba explains. Most settled in modern-day Turkey, Syria and Jordan, forming close-knit communities with the other displaced ethnicities. "Today, the descendants of those refugees have a constitutional right to return home," the leader adds. READ MORE: Where are the Syrian refugees? Russian control of Abkhazia gained a communist complexion in 1921, and within a decade the territory was subsumed into Soviet Georgia. With its snow-capped peaks, mountain lakes and azure waters, Abkhazia became a famous tourist destination - Stalin had five holiday houses in this " Soviet Riviera ". But beneath the sun-drenched surface, a campaign of " Georgianisation " saw the titular group persecuted and reduced to a minority. By the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, just one in five Abkhazians were ethnic Abkhaz. The August 1992 arrival of Georgian troops in response to a declaration of independence by Abkhazia's parliament sparked a horrific conflict, and allegations of ethnic cleansing have been levelled against both sides. By September 1993, Abkhazian militias had driven their Georgian opposition to the traditional Inguri river border - September 30 marked the 24th anniversary of what Abkhazians call Victory Day. In recent years the territory has swung towards Russia's orbit of influence; the United States currently describes Abkhazia as a " Russian occupied " region. The Arabic teacher Munir Kudzhba teaching an Arabic class at Abkhazia State University [Alice Aedy/Al Jazeera] Munir Kudzhba was one of the first Syrians to arrive in Abkhazia. Standing in a sparse classroom at the state university, writing stylish Arabic script on the blackboard, Kudzhba's wrinkled face and balding scalp betray his 73 or 74 years (he can't remember his exact age). The former communications technician hoped he would be enjoying retirement by now, split between homes in Damascus and the Syrian countryside. Instead, he teaches Arabic to a small collection of students at a campus on the outskirts of Abkhazia's capital, Sukhumi. Ethnically Abkhaz and proud of his heritage, Kudzhba had long harboured ambitions of moving to Abkhazia. But after a tumultuous early life - he fled the Golan Heights in his early 20s when Israel occupied the Syrian territory during the 1967 War - and a career with stints in Europe and Russia, Kudzhba believed his time had passed. "I thought I was too old for a new life," he tells Al Jazeera. "Then the crisis started." As the violence spiralled in 2012, Kudzhba purchased airfares for himself and four family members. They sold their car and flew to Russia - Sukhumi's airport has been inactive since the war. Although Kudzhba arrived in Abkhazia prior to the official government programme, he still received financial and housing support. A job at the university followed, and the lecturer says he is pleased to be giving back to Abkhazian society. "Life is getting better," he says enthusiastically, although admits his pre-existing Russian language skills help. "My wife is less happy, but this is the best we could do - we had to leave Syria." Officially, Kudzhba and his compatriots are labelled by Abkhazian officials as "repatriates" rather than "refugees". Kudzhba does not see himself as an outsider. "I meet people on the streets and feel like they are my brothers," he says as he smiles, gazing out towards Abkhazia's serene Black Sea shores. While Kudzhba hopes to visit Syria in the future, he does not envisage ever living there again. "This is my home now." READ MORE: Turkey's Syrian refugees carve out their own opportunities Integration woes Sipping tea in the afternoon sunlight, Viacheslav Chirikba - a linguist by profession and Abkhazia's foreign minister until 2016 - recalls how he and his colleagues plotted to bring Abkhaz Syrians home. "We have had long-standing ties with the diaspora in Syria," Chirikba tells Al Jazeera. "During the conflict here, some Syrian volunteers even came to fight. So when the war began in Syria, it was our problem too." As the crisis escalated, Chirikba began negotiating with Russia's embassy in Damascus and the Russian secret service to ensure the Syrians could pass through Sochi Airport en route to Abkhazia. "Without their support, the operation would not have happened," he says. Around 500 came in two waves - on a per capita basis, this is broadly equivalent to the number accepted annually by several large European states. While Chirikba hails the programme a "success story" of which he is "very proud - we rescued people from hardship, even possible death", it has not been without challenges. The Abkhazian government offered free courses in Russian and Abkhaz, but the language barrier proved insurmountable for some - and hampered job prospects in an already depressed economy. Local resentment surfaced in certain quarters over the generous financial assistance provided to new arrivals. One Syrian told International Alert in 2014 that "we're strangers here, and we're always reminded of it". The religious divide also frustrates integration. Abkhazians are overwhelmingly Orthodox Christians, while most of the Syrians practise Islam. IN PICTURES: Syrian refugees: A permanently temporary life Since gaining de facto independence, Abkhazia has operated the State Committee for Repatriation to entice diaspora home. This has been a deliberate strategy to increase the proportion of ethnic Abkhaz in Abkhazian society, a fractious issue since Soviet-era Georgianisation and the ethnically-charged war. "It is not only Syrians," says Foreign Minister Kove, adding that the committee has been partially successful in attracting Abkhaz from Turkey. The programme to repatriate Syrians was funded and coordinated by the committee. Liana Kvarchelia, a prominent civil society activist, denies that Abkhazia's rescue of the 500 Syrians was politically motivated. While she admits that "the number of ethnic Abkhaz in Abkhazia is source of concern", she says that "at the time the war broke out, we had contact with Abkhaz Syrians and knew they were in a very dire situation." She adds that "no one was thinking about our demographic situation". Grasping opportunities Omar Shakouj with friends in Sukhumi [Alice Aedy/Al Jazeera] A month after arriving in Abkhazia, Omar Shakouj was contemplating his options when an eccentric elderly local entered the lobby of his government-provided temporary accommodation, a hotel in Gudauta. Addressing the small group of Syrian refugees present, the man explained that he had a work opportunity for one of them. Shakouj was the first out of his seat. Jobs in fishing, wine-making, construction and hospitality followed. They might not be comparable to his pre-2013 role with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, but Shakouj has acquired Russian fluency and a taste for the local brandy, chacha. Shakouj eventually moved to Sukhumi and was given a house by the Abkhazian authorities. He laughs as he explains that he has not paid rent in four years. Sporting a short haircut and stubble on his face, the charismatic Shakouj holds courts over a meal at his favourite restaurant along Sukhumi's charming seaside promenade. He misses his former life in Syria - "before the war everything was great" - and expresses mixed opinions about the ongoing conflict. "It is not just the government to blame," he says in a fast-talking, hand-waving manner. "I do not care whether the people are right or the government are right - war is bad." Shakouj left before "it got really bad - before the rise of ISIL", and avoids reading news updates from his former home. "I would not return," he says with certainty. Not all of the refugees feel the same. Around 200 are reported to have already left, either back to Syria or joining the exodus to Europe. Shakouj's grandfather returned to Damascus for health reasons, believing that even in war-torn Syria the medical facilities were better than in Abkhazia. Shakouj remains undecided about his future. He wants to pursue further study away from Sukhumi, but is hesitant to start over again. For now, such dilemmas can wait, he says. Shakouj recently became engaged to a fellow Syrian, Lara Abdallah, who he met in Abkhazia. The two are now planning their wedding. A crumbling, frozen conflict zone wedged between Russia and Georgia, Abkhazia is a world away from the cosmopolitan Europe of Shakouj's dreams. Nonetheless, whether he stays in his ancestral homeland or follows the well-worn path to Western Europe, Shakouj appreciates the generous hospitality of his new compatriots. "For a tiny nation with no resources to bring us here, give us citizenship and treat us as locals, not refugees," he reflects, "I am incredibly grateful."

For centuries, following bloody conflicts, military leaders acknowledged that some weapons were simply too awful to be used, but those same militaries generally continued to use them. The first world war (WWI) saw the successful deployment of chemical weapons on a massive scale for the first time. The horror of millions of dead soldiers, in trenches and on battlefields, shocked nations into signing in 1925 the Geneva Protocol pledging to refrain from the use of chemical and biological weapons in future wars. Over the past century, the weapons that cause "unjustifiable" suffering in an indiscriminate and "unpredictable" manner have been subject to multilateral treaties that aim to disarm countries that possess them and control or ban the use of these weapons altogether. While some may feel sceptical that these efforts to disarm the world are effective, and challenges to disarmament remain, the disarmament treaties serve a key role in the regulation and reduction in stockpiles, as well as in the testing and use of certain weapons in conflicts. The use of banned weapons constitutes a war crime.

During this period, member-states are invited to "highlight the danger of the arms race, propagate the need for its cessation and increase public understanding of the urgent tasks of disarmament". These efforts include the regulation and banning of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), including nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as conventional weapons (CW) such as laser weapons - both incendiary and blinding, landmines and certain types of munitions, among others. The following five cases demonstrate the role international treaties play and how effectively they regulate the use and production of these weapons. Biological weapons (WMD) Biological weapons have not been used by states during conflict since World War I, after the Geneva Protocol was signed in 1925. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention further solidified state commitment to their prohibition in war. However, because the treaty does not provide any monitoring or verification mechanisms, many countries continue research and stockpiling activities. Biological toxins used for weapons include bacteria, viruses and fungi. Notorious historical examples of toxins used in times of war include: plague, smallpox, faeces, anthrax and cholera, among others. Major uses of biological weapons Date Event Description Pre-19th century Wars Used globally to cause injury and weaken enemies through contaminated water, poisoned bullets, intentional spreading of disease such as smallpox and plague among others. 1914-1918 World War I Germany used bio-agents to sabotage the enemies by spreading anthrax through animals. 1925 Treaty Geneva Protocol banned use of chemical and biological toxins in war. 1939-1945 World War II No combat use. Japan experimented biological weapons on prisoners, killing about 3,000 people. Nazis also conducted such experiments in Germany. 1972 Treaty Biological Weapons Convention bans the use, production and posession of biological weapons. 1945-present Research and Development No combat use since WWI, but most countries are believed to possess and continue stockpiling biological weapons. Chemical weapons (WMD) After the World War I massacres and the consequent signing of the Geneva Protocol, warring factions became hesitant and did not use chemical weapons on battlefields during the second world war (WWII). Nazis did, however, use them to murder millions of Jews in gas chambers. Chemical weapons have been used in many conflicts thereafter. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention implemented verification mechanisms that have seen through the voluntary destruction of 93 percent of the global stockpiles by signatory states. Furthermore, as using chemical weapons is a war crime, factions that resort to using them, do so in secret and deny having done so. Major uses of chemical weapons Date Event Description 1914-1918 World War I 190,000 tonnes produced by all parties involved in the war. Casualties: 1.2 million wounded, 100,000 dead. 1925 Treaty Geneva Protocol banned use of chemical and biological toxins in war. 1935-1936 Second Italo-Ethiopian War Used by Italian forces against Ethiopians. Casualties: 15,000 people killed or injured. 1939-1945 World War II Tonnes of weapons produced and stockpiles increased by all parties participant in war, yet no combat or battlefield uses. However, Nazi forces used chemical poisons in gas chambers to murder millions of Jews and other peoples. 1965-1975 Vietnam War 73 million litres of chemical agents were used during the war. Most notably the US used Agent Orange against the Vietnamese. Casualties ranged from 2.1 to 4.8 million people, spanning decades after the war; environmental damage spanning 31,000sq km. 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War Used by Iraqi forces, with casualties of upto 100,000 Iranians. In the Halabja Kurdish village attack, between 3,200 and 5,000 people were killed, and between 7,000 and 10,000 were injured. 1993 Treaty Chemical Weapons Convention signed. 2011-present Syrian civil war Used by Syrian government on rebels and civilians. Hundreds of casualties reported over various incidents. Nuclear weapons (WMD) Nuclear weapons were only used in wartime once, when the US bombed the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. A nuclear arms race followed, during the Cold War period between Western and Eastern bloc countries, mainly the US and USSR, during which there was an exponential growth in testing and stockpiling of nuclear weapons. The numerous treaties signed in this period have ended nearly all testing, and stockpiles have been reduced from over 60,000 in 1985 to about 15,000 currently, with a commitment to reduce this number to about 7,000 by 2022 by signatory countries. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) was awarded the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their work to this end. Anti-personnel landmines (CW) Landmines that target people have been used throughout history, but most widely during World War II. They cause death and crippling injuries to civilian populations long after conflicts have been settled. The 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, or Ottawa Treaty, set to eliminate the production and use of landmines. Since the implementation of the treaty, 159 signatory states have declared they have no stockpiles, having destroyed a combined 51 million mines. Post-conflict demining is an ongoing challenge for many of the most heavily mined countries, including Bosnia , Cambodia , Afghanistan , Myanmar and Egypt , as is the continued use of mines by non-signatory states. The International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) was awarded the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize "for their work for the banning and clearing of anti-personnel mines". Although stockpiles of traditional landmines have decreased, deaths and injuries have increased in recent years, due to the increased use of improvised explosive devices by non-state groups. Cluster munitions (CW) Cluster munitions, which eject small bomblets over a wide area after being released, were first used by the Soviet Union during World War II and have been used in nearly every bombardment campaign since. Civilians constitute 98 percent of casualties, falling victim both to the wide swaths of damage in the target area during an attack and to unexploded remnants - bomblets that land, but do not detonate - in the aftermath of the attack. While 108 countries have signed the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions, about half the world, including Saudi Arabia and Syria , have not and continue using them in current wars. Major uses of cluster bombs Date Event Description 1939-1945 World War I First major use of cluster munitions in Butterfly Bombs used by Germany. 1965-1975 Vietnam War US dropped about 800,000 bombs containing 383 million submunitions on Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia. 1999 First Gulf War US and allies dropped 61,000 bombs with 20 million submunitions on Iraq and Kuwait. 2001-2002 Afghanistan War US dropped 1,228 cluster bombs containing 248,056 submunitions on Afghanistan. 2006 Israel-Lebanon War Israel used up to four million submunitions in Lebanon. 2010 Treaty Convention on Cluster Munitions signed. 2011-present Syrian civil war Syrian government and Russian forces have regularly used cluster munitions in Syria. 2015-present Yemen War Saudi-led coalition has repeatedly used cluster bombs in Yemen. Future disarmament challenges, malicious application of innovative technology Technological advancements with potential for malicious use pose new challenges for disarmament efforts. The challenge is further complicated by the fact that many innovations are spearheaded by private sector entities, rather than states, which makes regulation and enforcement through a system of state membership-based organisations difficult. New innovations with potential for malicious application include cyberattacks, lethal autonomous weapons systems, unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), synthetic biotechnology (genetic engineering), satellite technology and artificial intelligence.

Story highlights How did the battle for Marawi begin? Who were the attackers? What happened to the civilians? When did the siege end? How will the city rebuild? Marawi, situated on the southern island of Mindanao in the Philippines, was the site of a bloody urban battle between ISIL fighters and government forces. Officially known as the Islamic City of Marawi, it is the largest Muslim city in the predominantly Catholic nation. ISIL fighters laid siege to the city in May, prompting months of heavy combat that prompted hundreds of thousands to flee and left more than 1,000 dead. {articleGUID} How did the battle for Marawi begin? On May 23, 2017, government forces clashed with armed fighters from two ISIL-affiliated groups - Abu Sayyaf and the Maute. The siege was triggered when the military tried to arrest top ISIL leader Isnilon Hapilon. This prompted attackers to fight back, declaring the city a new caliphate of ISIL, or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group, also known as ISIS. They burned a Catholic church, the city jail and two schools before occupying the main streets and major bridges of the city. Churchgoers and residents were taken hostage and a police officer was beheaded. On the evening of the attacks, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte declared martial law across the entire island of Mindanao. Initially, Duterte predicted the battle would be over within weeks. Who were the attackers? Top commanders Isnilon Hapilon and brothers Abdullah and Omar Maute were members of the local armed groups, Abu Sayyaf and the Maute. Both groups have previously been blamed for bombings, attacks against government forces and kidnappings in the Philippines. The battle involved many foreign fighters, from countries like Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as Yemen and Chechnya. There is evidence that the groups also recruited a large number of child soldiers , many from local schools in Marawi. What happened to the civilians? In the early days of the siege, residents were advised to stay locked indoors until troops arrived. But as the fighting continued, many fled for their lives. Over the past five months, about 300,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes and stay in temporary shelters outside the city. Government agencies warned that the violence in Marawi was causing a humanitarian crisis. Many of the people in the evacuation camps were poor even before the conflict started. With the city destroyed, residents are unable to return home and continue to suffer from dehydration, infections and waterborne diseases. Basic sanitation facilities, food and medical supplies are limited. {articleGUID} When did the siege end? The capture of Marawi led to the longest siege by armed fighters in the Philippines. On October 16, government troops stormed a hideout, killing both Hapilon and Maute. The next day, Duterte declared the city "liberated" even as sporadic fighting continued. On October 23, five months to the day from the start of the siege, Delfin Lorenzana, Philippine defence minister, declared there were no more "militants" in Marawi after troops overpowered the remaining fighters. The bodies of 40 suspected gunmen, and two of their wives, were found following the final stand. Soldiers are still looking for the three sons of Isnilon Hapilon, who are believed to be capable of taking over the leadership and continuing the fight. The battle resulted in the deaths of 920 fighters, 165 government soldiers and at least 45 civilians. Officials say martial law will continue to be implemented in Marawi and the surrounding Mindanao area as sporadic fighting continues there. How will the city rebuild? The historic city has been left in ruins and it's unclear when citizens will be able to return home. The government estimates it will cost around $1.1bn to rebuild the city, a task that could take years. The government is working on a peace deal that will give the predominantly Muslim region more autonomy. Lorenzana says the end of the violence signals the importance of regional cooperation in the fight against "terrorism" in the Philippines and its neighbouring countries. Still, experts have warned of possible future attacks from other armed groups in the region that have pledged allegiance to ISIL. 101 East Taking Back Marawi function showVideo() { RenderPagesVideo('5625768239001', 0, '100%', 473, 'bottomvideo'); $(".article-video-block-img").remove();} SOURCE: Al Jazeera News ABOUT THE AUTHOR Maxine Betteridge-Moes ISIS Philippines War & Conflict Politics
The Syrian area of Quneitra is seen in the background as an Israeli tank parks on a hill, near the ceasefire line between Israel and Syria, in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights [Reuters] Over the weekend, cross-border violence between Israel and Syria set off an exchange of heated threats between the two countries. On Saturday, the neighbours traded blame when Israel attacked Syrian artillery cannons, claiming it was responding to what might have been errant rocket fire that landed in the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan Heights . However, neither the cross-border violence nor the threats are new. There have been almost routine attacks in the form of rocket fire - as well as assassinations and air raids carried out exclusively by Israel - that have intensified since the war in Syria began in 2011. However, while the Israeli army has frequently shelled Syrian military positions and bases throughout the war, Syrian government forces have never directly retaliated - although Israel speculates that some of the stray fire is intentional. What types of attacks take place? The violence from the war in Syria, which started in 2011, has spilled over the border between the two countries. Israel's attacks on the Syrian army happen sporadically and are thought to take place when stray fire - whether by the Syrian army or by rebels - falls within the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, when arms convoys pass near the border, or when Iran-backed fighters launch rocket fire. In the case of stray fire, the Israeli army says the Syrian government is responsible and retaliates by firing on government positions, sometimes deep inside Syria. Following an incident of errant fire last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: "We will attack anyone who attacks us. We won't accept spillover. If they attack us, we return fire. And it doesn't take much time." {articleGUID} According to Ofer Zalzberg, the Israel/Palestine senior analyst for the International Crisis Group, there were approximately 20 attempted attacks by Iran-backed fighters on the border. He believes that Israel also retaliates when there is "intentional 'spillover' by rebels who prod Israel to attack the Syrian military". Israel usually refuses to comment on attacks it conducts in Syria. However, it is suspected of carrying out the following infamous attacks: Killing three Syrian pro-government fighters in Quneitra, near the Golan Heights - April 23, 2017 Attacking a weapons supply hub operated by Hezbollah near Damascus airport - April 27, 2017 Bombing a Syrian government facility depot thought to be associated with the country's chemical weapons production - September 7, 2017 Killing several Hezbollah fighters, including Jihad Mughniyeh, son of a slain military leader, in an air raid on Quneitra - January 19, 2015 Assassinating Hezbollah's Samir Kuntar on the outskirts of Damascus - December 19, 2015 Israeli soldiers observe the Syrian side of the Quneitra border crossing between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and Syria [Ronen Zvulun/Reuters] Why are they so frequent? Syria and Israel have technically been in a state of war since 1948, after the ethnic cleansing of Palestine and the Arab-Israeli war that ensued that year. In 1967, Israel occupied the Syrian territory of the Golan Heights and continues to occupy part of it to this day. The two countries signed a disengagement agreement in 1974 following the 1973 war between Israel, Syria and Egypt . {articleGUID} The border region has remained relatively quiet since then, but the eruption of the war in Syria unleashed a new chapter in Israeli-Syrian relations. The metamorphosis of the war is critical to understanding the increase in such attacks over the past few years. What started as an uprising against President Bashar al-Assad during the 2011 Arab uprisings, transformed into a civil war between the armed opposition and government forces vying for control of territory. Though the armed opposition was making substantive gains in the first leg of the war, the intervention of Russia , Iran and Hezbollah on the side of Assad's forces, tipped the scales in the government's favour. The growing power and influence of Iran and Hezbollah in Syria is Israel's primary concern - a fear that it does not conceal. In 2006, Israel and Hezbollah fought a bloody 34-day war that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,100 Lebanese, the majority of whom were civilians. An estimated 159 Israelis, including 43 civilians, were also killed by Hezbollah's rocket attacks. Worried that Iran is transferring weapons to Hezbollah, Israel has frequently targeted arms convoys, saying it would continue to block any attempts to buttress the Lebanese movement. Netanyahu has accused Iran of "turning Syria into a base of military entrenchment" and wanting to use "Syria and Lebanon as war fronts against its declared goal to eradicate Israel". In August, an Israeli military official admitted for the first time that the country's army had attacked Syrian and Hezbollah arms convoys dozens of times over the last five years.

Any threat or even any perceived threat is enough reason for Israel to retaliate with air raids, shelling, whether the Syrian army positions, or Hezbollah positions, or the Iran Revolutionary Guard fighters," Syrian political analyst Omar Kouch told Al Jazeera from Istanbul. "Israel wants to show the region that it has the upper hand and can strike any target it wants," he added. "When a shell falls to the Israeli side by mistake, Israel responds by striking the base or the area it came from. This is a show of force and sends a signal to all the parties." Who is responsible? While the Syrian government says Israel is collaborating with "terrorist groups" inside Syria and uses such attacks as an excuse to target the government, Israel lays blame on the Syrian army for any rockets emanating from areas under its control. According to analysts, both countries are to blame for any escalation of border violence. Sobhi Hadidi, an independent Syrian political analyst based in France, says that although the "concept of blame does not exist in international relations", the two countries play a distinct role. "If you're speaking about international law, then Israel is to blame because it is attacking another country. But the Syrian regime is also involved in provoking Israel by encouraging Hezbollah," Hadidi told Al Jazeera. Kouch agreed: "The Iranian militias take responsibility for this - when it nears the borders, it knows that Israel will respond. When it launches a missile on the borders, it knows that Israel will respond. When it tries to transfer weapons to Hezbollah, it knows that Israel will block this […] It's a sort of game." Will the attacks lead to a full-blown war? The likelihood of such tit-for-tat attacks leading to war is very low, analysts say. "The regime has been hit by Israel over many years, and it has not responded once - not directly," said Kouch, noting that the Syrian government is in a weak position vis-a-vis Israel. Despite repeated threats from Assad, including most recently in a letter to the United Nations warning of the "grave consequences of such repeated aggressive attacks", government forces have been bogged down by the six-year war. Yet, some say a future escalation should not be ruled out. {articleGUID} "Over the last year, Israel ended its policy of ambiguity regarding attacks it perpetrates in Syria - among other things to underline there are steps it would not tolerate," Zalzberg said. "Initially, Assad chose to disregard them, but the more the balance of the fighting in Syria tilts in his favour, the more he feels able and obliged to retort. "While a major escalation between the sides is unlikely, such a dynamic nourishes a transformation of the Israeli-Syrian relationship from one of de-facto indifference to active antagonism with low-level violence."

Canadian feminists, eager to put Canada first, are applauding a hollow feminism that diverts and deflects, dresses up and glosses over the dirty business of war and weapons, writes Zakaria [Reuters] " I am definitely here to push my feminist agenda, " Canadian Minister for International Development Marie-Claude Bibeau declared to a journalist at the World Bank meetings held in Washington, DC at the end of October. Bibeau was talking about Canada's much-touted and widely feted "feminist international assistance" policy. Announced earlier this year, the policy has been described by Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland as " a matter of basic justice and basic economics ". Under its stipulations, Canada will direct over 95 percent of its development budget towards the task of "empowering women," in turn making "families and countries more prosperous". It is a hopeful agenda but sadly not one that includes empowering all women. This summer, before Bibeau went off selling Canada's shiny new feminist agenda, the Canadian Foreign Ministry in Ottawa had been busy with dirtier business. In a reluctant statement issued in late July, the Ministry announced that it was "deeply concerned" that Saudi Arabia's rulers " appear to be deploying Canadian-made armoured vehicles in an escalating conflict with Saudi citizens ". Even this acknowledgement of sorts came only after a Canadian newspaper published a story showing that the combat vehicles manufactured by Canadian company Teradyne were used against Saudi civilians in the country's eastern Al-Qatif province. So far, Canada's Trudeau-led "feminist" government has been unwilling to look into the $15bn deal that it inherited from its predecessor, taking the line that without " evidence of misuse " and "reasonable risk" to civilians there was no need to stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia . Foreign Minister Freeland has even gone so far as to discard a leaked report of a United Nations-mandated panel that has denounced "widespread and systematic" attacks on civilian targets by the Saudi-led coalition in neighbouring Yemen . Yemeni women, like the Saudi women of Al-Qatif province, are not included in the empowering agenda that Canada wants to take to the world's women. This here is the glossy and catchy feminism of convenience, called on at conferences but discarded and shoved to the side when it comes to lucrative arms deals. Then, there is the case of Nigerian women. In September of this year, a few months after Canada had announced its new global feminist agenda, the US government signed a $593m arms deal with the Nigerian military. A crucial and key component of this deal are A-29 Super Tucano warplanes whose engines are manufactured by Pratt and Whitney Canada . These Pratt Whitney outfitted Super Tucano aircraft will be part of the Nigerian Air Force, which has in the past used light aircraft to bomb refugee camps, killing dozens of civilians. An older deal made last year with Canadian-led Streit Group also sold 177 armoured vehicles to the Nigerian military. The hedging that has typified the Trudeau government's response to its part in arming some of the world's most repressive and anti-feminist governments suggests that the "feminist" label it has pinned to its dealings with the world is merely crafty sloganeering. Per its assumptions, the use of Canadian armoured vehicles to mow down hapless Saudi civilians or bomb Yemeni women and children or even Nigerian refugees has little to do with feminism or empowering women. In this circumscribed and compartmentalised version of feminism a la Canada, the sale of weapons that maintain the dominance of repressive, brutal and male-dominated regimes cannot be held against a country's commitments to empowering its women. The one stands separate and distinct from the other, the self-enriching agendas of saving Canadian jobs and safeguarding Canadian affluence trumping any true concern for the world's women. This here is the glossy and catchy feminism of convenience, called on at conferences but discarded and shoved to the side when it comes to lucrative arms deals. The "basic justice" that Freeland mentioned in her speech on Canada's foreign policy priorities has no place in these latter discussions. {articleGUID} The groundwork of this sort of feminism, which uses all the right rhetoric, talks about empowering local women, then sneaks bombs and ammunition to fuel the very conflicts that imperil them, was laid over a decade and a half ago by Canada's neighbour (and partner in arms sales) the United States . As still-suffering Afghans remember well, one of the avowed pretexts for invading Afghanistan in September 2001 was, as announced by First Lady Laura Bush herself, the liberation of Afghan women and the facilitation of their return to schools, to security and to freedom. As the years and then a decade wore on, a two-faced approach reigned. The killing of Afghan civilians including women and children, the night raids by US forces that terrified families, and the accidental bombings of hospitals were all swept under the rug because the United States was allegedly "empowering" Afghan women. If the United States can use the feminism-as-branding strategy to sell a war, then it follows that Canada can follow suit with its international-assistance agenda. That the United States has not delivered on any of the promises it made to Afghan women, and that two-thirds of Afghan girls still don't attend school as result of poverty, insecurity and displacement, doesn't seem to bother anyone. This last fact likely recommends the strategy to the Canadians, since it proves the premise that the feminist label is valid not because it has to deliver to the women it claims to empower but because it can better sell government programs, wars or aid, to the voters at home. The omnipotent logic of Western largesse against global want dictates that it is the givers who matter; the better Canadian voters can feel about themselves, the more successful Canada's groundbreaking feminist international assistance policy will be deemed to be. So clever is this political branding trick that even local Canadian politicians are taking a go at it; Valerie Plante, a mayoral candidate in Montreal, announced last week that if elected she would inaugurate the city's first " feminist " Metro line. What would make this line "feminist" (beyond being pink) remained unspecified. It follows, then, that even while Canadian armored vehicles ply the desert border between Saudi Arabia and Yemen or the lanes of Maiduguri, and while jets with Pratt and Whitney engines drop bombs on civilians in different portions of the globe, Canadian voters energised by the historic nature of their "feminist" government and a "feminist" international aid assistance policy can continue to smugly look away. That the possibility of the "basic justice" identified by Chrystia Freeland as central to empowerment has been eviscerated for these women, that Canada is complicit in the crimes of these regimes, does not give anyone pause. American feminists remained largely silent when feminism became a pretext for war. Canadian feminists, eager to put Canada first, are doing the same, applauding a hollow feminism that diverts and deflects, dresses up and glosses over the dirty business of war and weapons.

Kim Jong-Un looks on during a visit to the Chemical Material Institute of the Academy of Defence Science in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency [KCNA via Reuters] It is a mistake to imagine that any potential war with North Korea will be like a gentlemanly game of chess, in which each side takes turns and the understandings for offence and defence are robust. This misperception is particularly evident in two areas. First, it is assumed that the missile defences currently bristling around South Korea and Japan will protect them from short, medium and long-range intercontinental missiles sent from North Korea. The hopes in this area are pinned on remarkable achievements of these systems tracking and destroying missiles . The well-touted examples in this area include the Aegis and Terminal High Altitude Defence ( THAAD ) systems against medium-range missiles, which have successful interception rates of 83 percent and 100 percent , respectively. The short-range missile defence systems, such as the Patriot, also appears to have improved greatly in recent times. Although these figures sound impressive, they are spoiled by a number of considerations. First, although the success rate for hitting short and medium-range missiles appears good, the success rate for destroying intercontinental missiles is only just about 50 percent. Second, most of the testing is conducted in near perfect conditions, in which one target is carefully tracked and destroyed. Third, the scale of the deployment is small. That is, with the American Ground-based Midcourse Defence system against intercontinental missiles, only 44 interceptors have been deployed. With the THAAD, only one battery (with 48 interceptor missiles) has been deployed in South Korea, although this has been supplemented with 16 batteries of Patriot missiles (each with 16 launchers). {articleGUID} Although supported by other anti-missile technologies, these ones will be the forefront of trying to stop, at best guess, 200 missile launchers and between 600 to 1000 short-range missiles and maybe 100 other medium and long-range missiles coming in from North Korea. It can be expected that North Korea would fire most of these with great speed, deception and strategy, to attack, overpower and trick the missile defences. This attack would be nothing like the near perfect field conditions that most missile testing is currently conducted. North's chemical and biological weapon stockpile The second misperception is that although missiles may be the preferred delivery system for nuclear weapons , this is not the case for the other weapons of mass destruction, namely chemical and biological weapons that North Korea may possess. The base problem here is that although the international community agreed to prohibit both chemical and biological weapons as methods of warfare in 1925 and then updated these prohibitions for bioweapons in 1972 and chemical weapons in 1993, it is not at all clear that North Korea considers itself bound by these considerations. That is, although North Korea signatory to the 1925 agreement, it is not a signatory to 1993 convention, and although it has adhered to the 1972 convention, it has fallen far behind the rudimentary expectations in this area. In short, be sceptical about what the missile defences can actually achieve, expect chemical weapons to be part of the mix and don't be surprised if bioweapons were also thrown in. Of chemical weapons, the strongest evidence of what they possess is the assassination of Kim Jong-nam with VX gas in Malaysia . This proof followed decades of speculation that North Korea was manufacturing chemical weapons . Current South Korean estimates suggest that the North has an existing stockpile of between 2 ,500 and 5,000 metric tonnes of chemical weapons ( pdf ) . Although chemical weapons can also be delivered by missile, plane or human hands, it is likely that the North Korean ones would be delivered by the 5,400 rocket launchers and 4,400 artillery pieces that they are believed to possess. {articleGUID} Although some analysts argue that Kim Jong-un 's highly publicised official visits to seemingly unimportant pesticide factories and other laboratories in North Korea signal the existence of a covert bioweapons programme, our knowledge in this area is nothing more than guesswork. Although it appears likely that North Korea has been developing bioweapons since the 1960s ( pdf ), and probably has understanding of about 13 types of biological weapons (including plague, anthrax, cholera and smallpox), there is no unambiguous evidence suggesting a large scale, advanced and successful bioweapons programme and production in North Korea . There are currently black holes of knowledge with regards to whether North Korea have successfully weaponised biological material and passed the barriers that stopped others ; whether they have effective delivery systems (which could be missiles, drones, planes and/or human agents) and whether they have defence measures to ensure that any pathogens do not backlash against their own population. However, this scarcity of information within a country shrouded in secrecy, which has continually surprised the international community with advances in nuclear and missile technology, should not, under any circumstances, be taken as proof that they do not possess effective bioweapons. In short, there aren't fully effective defences established to protect South Korea, Japan or other countries in case North Korea decides to go to war.

Iraqi security forces and volunteers celebrate in front of Governorate Council Building in Kirkuk, 290km north of Baghdad, Iraq, Monday, October 16, 2017 [Emad Matti/Iraq] In the early hours of Monday, two regular Iraqi divisions, supported by thousands of combatants from the Federal Police and Counter Terrorism Service, began a two-pronged offensive against Kurdish-held Kirkuk, seeking to reclaim the disputed city more than three years after Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) fled it in the face of an assault by the Islamic State of the Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ), also known as ISIS. A little more than 12 hours later, the ISF managed to restore their control over the oil-rich city where they have been absent for years, severely upsetting Kurdish plans for independence. Very early in the operation, the Iraqi military announced that it had taken over the K1 military base and the nearby Kirkuk Air Base west of the city. This was denied by the Kurdistan Region Security Council, which said in a statement that the Peshmerga destroyed at least five US-made Humvee armoured vehicles being used by the state-sanctioned, but Iran-sponsored, militias from the Popular Mobilisation Forces, or Hashd al-Sha'abi in Arabic. However, by late afternoon, Iraqi soldiers were taking photographs of themselves in the former governor's office in downtown Kirkuk, and the national flag had replaced the Kurdish Regional Government's (KRG) over the city skyline. Kurdish factionalism undermines independence bid The Iraqi military's advance was apparently facilitated by factionalism within the ranks of the Peshmerga, a force whose flaws have now been laid bare. The Taza Khormatu district southeast of Kirkuk was surrendered after Peshmerga units loyal to KRG President Masoud Barzani 's rivals in the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) - the late Jalal Talabani's party - withdrew from their areas of responsibility. These units with partisan loyalties also withdrew from their headquarters in Qasbat al-Bashir, 20 kilometres south of Kirkuk, three days before the offensive began, and without a single shot being fired. {articleGUID} PUK officials said that they handed back military bases as there was a deal to surrender them to Baghdad before ISIL overran the region in 2014. Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party, however, will see the decision by the PUK to withdraw its fighters from major approaches to the city as handing the enemy the keys to the city gate. Hemin Hawrami, senior assistant to Barzani, tweeted that the PUK had "betrayed Kurdistan and [the Peshmerga] … by abandoning key fronts", accusing them of being part of an offensive that he said was being led by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Making matters potentially worse for Barzani was the appearance of flags belonging to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK , who are blacklisted as a terrorist organisation by the United States , the EU, and - most importantly in this conflict - neighbouring Turkey. Turkey , who has fought the PKK domestically for decades, was incensed at their former ally Barzani and the alleged presence of PKK fighters in Kirkuk was denounced by the Iraqi government as a "declaration of war". Although the allegation was swiftly denied by the KRG on Sunday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry pledged on Monday that it would work with Baghdad to help destroy PKK elements in Kirkuk. After all, the Peshmerga are largely equipped with US-made weapons, while the Iraqi military is also currently using American-made M1 Abrams tanks and heavy artillery against the Kurds. However, one cannot help but suspect that Baghdad's focus on a PKK presence is for Turkish consumption. After all, it was only very recently that the Iraqi government was at loggerheads with Turkey over its military base in Bashiqa in northern Iraq , and Baghdad has tolerated PKK affiliates - such as the Yazidi YBS - on its border with Syria . Baghdad and its allied militias have had long enough to contain or even defeat these PKK affiliates, yet have done nothing until now. Their sudden action is designed to appeal to sentiments in Ankara, its latest unlikely ally in the wake of the Kurdish independence referendum last month, who will also be seeking to use an alleged PKK presence to garner public support for moving against their one-time ally Barzani. US may reset Iraq to pre-ISIL stage The KRG has also attempted to characterise this offensive as an Iranian-led operation due to US President Donald Trump's refusal to certify the Iranian nuclear deal and call for tougher sanctions against its elite military wing, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) on Saturday . This demonstrates a lack of Kurdish confidence in the United States ' willingness to intervene on the KRG's behalf, and a desire to get Washington back on board with the Kurds , especially considering the Peshmerga's assistance to the US-led anti-ISIL coalition. So far, however, the Pentagon has only stated that it encourages "dialogue" between the belligerents, and desired the parties not to undertake any "destabilising actions that distract from the fight against ISIS". This statement was certainly not what Erbil was hoping for, especially as the US went on to state that it continued to "support a unified Iraq", and characterised the independence referendum as an "unfortunate" and "unilateral" move. {articleGUID} With Washington's lack of desire to intervene, it is possible that American strategists were willing for the Iraqi military to advance to recapture Kirkuk before moving onto other disputed territories under the KRG's de facto - but not de jure - control. That said, it is extremely unlikely that the US will allow Baghdad to reassert its control over the autonomous Kurdish region as a whole, but will likely exert pressure on both sides to stop fighting once Baghdad's and Erbil's positions have been reset to a pre-2014 state of affairs before ISIL burst onto the scene. After all, the Peshmerga are largely equipped with US-made weapons, while the Iraqi military is also currently using American-made M1 Abrams tanks and heavy artillery against the Kurds. Without US support, the Peshmerga was easily overwhelmed and may soon also be forced to the negotiating table to concede defeat and nullify their independence vote. Equally, without American supplies, and with the threat of other measures against Baghdad especially considering Iranian involvement, the Iraqi military is unlikely to advance far beyond Kirkuk. With such regional and international forces being brought to bear against Barzani's ambition for an independent Kurdistan, and with the crushing loss of oil-rich Kirkuk as well, it seems that the Kurdish leader will have to sue for peace. Unfortunately for those who voted "Yes" in last month's independence poll, this will mean that, for now at least, their dream may have to remain just that.

People move the remaining pomegranate fruits after a Saudi-led air raid in Saada, Yemen October 17, 2017 [Naif Rahma/Reuters] Earlier this year, I left my home in Yemen to try to tell the world the story of a collapsing and suffering country, a story that largely has been ignored despite the United Nations calling it "the largest humanitarian crisis in the world". Ignored, despite grave violations committed by all parties to the conflict since 2014, including the use of starvation as a weapon of war. Ignored, despite the war having driven seven million civilians - more than the entire population of the Washington, DC, metropolitan area - to the brink of famine . Ignored, despite more than 750,000 cases of cholera, the world's worst outbreak of that disease. Last month, the international community took the first step to no longer ignore the conflict in Yemen, when the UN Human Rights Council established a new international panel of experts to report on the violations that have been committed by all sides to this horrible conflict. In so doing, the international community finally has sent a clear message to all warring parties - to the Saudis and their partners, to the Ansar Allah armed group (also known as the Houthis ) and their ally former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh , to current Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi 's forces and armed groups loyal to him - that the world finally is watching, that impunity will no longer reign in Yemen, and that violations of human rights and of the laws of war will meet consequences. {articleGUID} Having made this promise of accountability more than two years into the conflict, the international community owes it to the people of Yemen to ensure that the words of the Human Rights Council's resolution are translated into reality. The UN must select strong, impartial experts for this panel, women and men of character who will not be afraid to identify perpetrators of violations on all sides. Countries like the United States , the United Kingdom, and France , which have stood by their Saudi and Emirati allies despite documented attacks on civilians - and indeed, have continued to sell Saudi Arabia and the UAE bombs and other weapons for use in their air strikes on Yemen - must give the UN panel proper backing, no matter its findings and conclusions. And the UN experts must realise that their mandate is to speak truth to power, and to identify those responsible for killing innocent men, women, and children in Yemen. If the international community takes this opportunity to work to end the conflict, Yemen's next chapter could be one of hope, and we could begin rebuilding our broken country and saving millions of lives from being lost. Too often, the causes of peace and justice are presented as irreconcilable in conflict, but in Yemen, the establishment of this new UN investigative mechanism can help advance the peaceful resolution of the conflict, by shining a light on violations by the parties and making clear that victories on the battlefield cannot lead to political gains. Coupled with diplomatic pressure, it could incentivise all parties to go back to the negotiating table. The international community should use this moment of heightened scrutiny to restart the UN-led peace process. {articleGUID} The US, the UK , and France - as permanent UN Security Council members who did not support a strong UN inquiry - have a special responsibility to seize this moment. If the international community misses this opportunity and continues to ignore Yemen, the consequences will be dire. Not only will Yemen's people continue to suffer starvation, bombardment, and disease on a scale unseen anywhere else in the world, but the threat to the West will increase from terrorists and extremists whom the US State Department has confirmed are using Yemen's instability to multiply their strength and numbers. The story of Yemen that I have told on my travels to date has been one of tragedy, suffering, and neglect by the rest of the world. If the international community takes this opportunity to work to end the conflict, Yemen's next chapter could be one of hope, and we could begin rebuilding our broken country and saving millions of lives from being lost.

RenderPagesVideo('4248381068001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); The US has published a trove of declassified documents that shed new light on the mindset of Osama bin Laden , the late al-Qaeda leader, before he was killed by US Navy Seals in 2011. Hunkered down in his Pakistani compound, bin Laden pleaded with his followers to stay focused on attacking the US instead of being dragged into Muslim infighting. "The focus should be on killing and fighting the American people and their representatives," bin Laden wrote in one of the documents revealed on Wednesday. The letter was among thousands of files found by US Navy SEALs on May 2, 2011, when they descended on bin Laden's hideout in the garrison town of Abbottabad and shot him dead. US intelligence agencies have now declassified more than 100 of these documents taken from bin Laden's archive, after politicians ordered the move and critics accused the CIA of withholding material. The AFP news agency was given exclusive access to the documents in advance of their release. CIA translations Jeff Anchukaitis, spokesman for the US Director of National Intelligence's office, said the release of "a sizeable tranche of documents recovered during the raid" was in keeping with US President Barack Obama 's call for "increased transparency". It was also in accordance with a law obliging the spy agencies to review all the bin Laden materials for possible release, he said. The documents are CIA translations of the originals in English, and AFP had no way to independently verify the materials or the accuracy of the translation.

But CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani said the declassification had been long planned and had not been intended as a response to Hersh's report. From the strategic and theological discussions to the mundane details of domestic funding and security measures, the documents show Bin Laden once again attacking the West in a spectacular fashion. Mindful of drone raids taking out senior leaders, bin Laden frequently referred to security headaches and advised against communicating by email. He scolded his followers for gathering in large groups and fretted about a microscopic bug being inserted in his wife's clothes. He laid out plans to groom a new cadre of leaders willing to risk the dangers of joining al-Qaeda , and his associates discussed arrangements for smuggling bin Laden's favourite son and likely heir, Hamza, to Pakistan . Citing domestic US public opposition to the Vietnam War, bin Laden argued that the only way to alter US foreign policy was to "start striking America to force it to abandon these rulers and leave the Muslims alone". But the documents also highlight deep divisions among his followers over how to wage their campaigns. Bin Laden warned that conflict with regimes in the Middle East would distract the fighters from hitting hard at what as far as he was concerned was the real enemy - the US. "We should stop operations against the army and the police in all regions, especially Yemen," he wrote. The correspondence reflected bin Laden's "worry that disunity within the global jihadist movement could spell its demise," said a senior US intelligence analyst. The letters also show bin Laden was stunned by the Arab uprisings that erupted across the region from 2010 and urged his deputies to seize the moment of "revolution" and rally Muslim youth. ISIL and bin Laden Al-Qaeda's branch in Iraq , which would later morph into the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) group - and which now increasingly overshadows al-Qaeda - also came up in the documents. Bin Laden and his then deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, received a scathing rebuke in a letter from some Iraqi supporters, who demanded they denounce the bloodletting in Iraq. The Jihad and Reform Front warned bin Laden that God would hold him to account "for blessing the work done by the al-Qaeda in Iraq organisation without disavowing the scandals that are committed in your name". "If you still can, then this is your last chance to remedy the jihad breakdown that is about to take place in Iraq, that is mostly caused by your followers," said the letter dated May 22, 2007. Bin Laden wrote of the need for large-scale operations, even though some of his deputies were finding it difficult to organise massive attacks as they tried to avert drones overhead and US eavesdropping. {articleGUID} PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY One document recently declassified in a "terrorism" trial in New York but not released on Wednesday quotes Abu Musab al-Suri, an al-Qaeda veteran, who advocated going after smaller targets of opportunity as a more realistic approach, intelligence officials said. "Bin Laden at the time of his death remained focused on large-scale operations while other al-Qaeda leaders believed smaller operations, or inciting lone attacks, could succeed at bleeding the West economically," the intelligence analyst said. Bin Laden failed to win the argument. After his death, al-Qaeda's leadership called for lone-wolf attacks, and Suri's idea of "individual jihad" won out. ISIL, which was officially excommunicated from al-Qaeda, now controls vast swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria and its online propaganda has been blamed for inspiring attacks from Paris to the Dallas suburbs.

Here are the latest developments on the tensions with North Korea, since the UN tightened its sanctions on August 6 : NATO urges sanctions implementation. On Tuesday, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg urged all United Nation members to fully and transparently implement sanctions against North Korea, which he said has emerged as a global threat able to fire ballistic missiles as far as Europe and North America. Trilateral meeting in Hawaii. Senior defence officials from the United States, South Korea and Japan held trilateral talks on Monday and urged North Korea to walk away from its "destructive and reckless path" of weapons development, the US military said in a statement. October 23, 2017 UK: 'Military option must remain on the table' A military option must remain on the table in dealing with North Korea’s nuclear program, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Monday "I don't think anybody could conceivably want a military solution to this problem," Johnson said at a speech in London. "And yet clearly... the possibility of some kind of military option... that possibility must at least theoretically be maintained on the table." Mattis to visit South Korea US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he would talk with Asian allies about North Korea and the crisis caused by Pyongyang's "reckless" provocations, as he kicked off a week-long trip to the region on Monday to meet defense chiefs in the Philippines. Mattis' trip to Asia, which will also include stops in Thailand and South Korea, comes just weeks before President Donald Trump's first visit to Asia. Abe and Trump to raise pressure Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and US President Donald Trump agreed to work together to raise pressure on North Korea, Yasutoshi Nishimura, a deputy chief cabinet secretary, said on Monday. Abe and Trump spoke by telephone after the Japanese premier's ruling coalition scored a big win in an election on Sunday. Abe pledges to tackle crisis After an election victory, Japan's leader pledged to tackle what he called Japan's two national crises: the military threat from North Korea and an aging and shrinking population. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said at a news conference that he is committed to protecting the Japanese people's prosperity and peace from any contingency. "I will pursue decisive and strong diplomacy to tackle North Korea's missile, nuclear and abduction issues and put further pressure to get it to change its policy," he said. October 22, 2017 Jimmy Carter offers to visit North Korea Former US President Jimmy Carter said he would be willing to travel to North Korea on behalf of the Trump administration to help diffuse rising tensions Carter, a Democrat who was president from 1977 to 1981, said he had spoken to Trump’s National Security Adviser Lieutenant General HR McMaster, but so far has gotten a negative response. "I told him that I was available if they ever need me," the New York Times quoted Carter as saying. October 21, 2017 Trump to visit South Korea On November 3, Donald Trump will start a trip that will take him to Japan , South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines . It will be his first tour of Asia since taking power in January. In an interview with Fox Business Network, Trump said he wants to "keep things very, very low key" with the Chinese President Xi Jinping until the Chinese leader emerges from the party congress. October 20, 2017 No talks over nuclear programme Pyongyang does not plan to hold any talks with Washington about its nuclear programme , a senior North Korean diplomat said on Friday, declaring that possessing nuclear weapons was a matter of life and death for North Korea. Choe Son-hui, director-general of the North American department of North Korea’s foreign ministry, told a non-proliferation conference in Moscow Washington would "have to put up" with North Korea’s nuclear status. "This is a matter of life and death for us. The current situation deepens our understanding that we need nuclear weapons to repel a potential attack." Switzerland sanctions North Korea Switzerland decreed that it will implement the latest UN sanctions on North Korea, affecting the financial sector and work authorisations for North Koreans in Switzerland . North Koreans whose employment contracts were signed before September 11 are exempt from the sanctions. Any new North Korean workers entering the state are to be turned away, according to the report. All joint ventures and "cooperation" projects are to be suspended by January 9. Russia and China propose roadmap Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov urged world powers on Friday to get behind a joint Russian-Chinese roadmap for settling the crisis over North Korea’s weapons program. Speaking at a conference on non-proliferation in Moscow, Lavrov said that the break-up of a deal on Iran 's nuclear program would send an alarming message about international security mechanisms, and could impact the situation on the Korean Peninsula. October 19, 2017 North Korea threatens US ship North Korea's official news agency described a US aircraft carrier patrolling off the Korean Peninsula as a "primary target" and said Washington should expect an " unimaginable " attack. North Korea condemned Seoul and Washington's move to mobilise nuclear strategic assets near the volatile peninsula. Pyongyang has slammed the warship manoeuvres as a "rehearsal for war". "The US is running amok by introducing under our nose the targets we have set as primary ones. The US should expect that it would face [an] unimaginable strike at an unimaginable time," said a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency. "Unprecedented" communication with Australia North Korea has sent a letter to Australia’s parliament, warning it is a nuclear power and will not be cowed by US President Trump's threats to destroy it, according to a copy of the letter published in an Australian newspaper on Friday. "If Trump thinks that he would bring the DPRK, a nuclear power, to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance," said a facsimile of the letter, published by the Sydney Morning Herald and verified by Australia’s foreign ministry. "Trump threatened to totally destroy the DPRK ... it is an extreme act of threatening to totally destroy the whole world." At a press conference in Sydney, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the note was an "unprecedented" communication. "It is not the way they usually publish their global messages. The collective strategy of imposing maximum diplomatic and economic pressure through sanctions on North Korea is working. This is a response to the pressure." October 18, 2017 US, S Korea, Japan discuss North Korea Senior officials from the United States , South Korea and Japan reaffirmed their countries’ commitment Wednesday to finding a diplomatic solution to the threat posed by North Korea’s rapidly expanding nuclear program. However, US Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan stressed that the allies must be prepared for any contingency. After meeting with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul, John Sullivan said the US continues to view diplomacy, supported by pressure and sanctions, as the primary means for solving the North Korean nuclear problem. "Our objective is, throughout that campaign of pressure, to bring North Korea to the negotiating table without preconditions so that we can achieve our objective of a denuclearised Korean Peninsula," Sullivan said at a news conference. Clinton: Threats of war 'dangerous' Former US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said on Wednesday that "cavalier" threats to start a war on the Korean Peninsula were "dangerous and short-sighted", urging the United States to get all parties to the negotiating table. Clinton also called on China to take a "more outfront role" in enforcing sanctions against North Korea aimed at curbing its missile and nuclear development. "There is no need for us to be bellicose and aggressive (over North Korea)," Clinton told the World Knowledge Forum in the South Korean capital of Seoul, stressing the need for more pressure on North Korea and diplomacy to bring Pyongyang to talks. October 17, 2017 Nuclear war may break out at 'any moment' North Korea's deputy UN ambassador has warned the situation on the Korean Peninsula "has reached the touch-and-go point and a nuclear war may break out any moment". Kim In-ryong told the UN General Assembly's disarmament committee on Monday that North Korea is the only country in the world that has been subjected to "such an extreme and direct nuclear threat" from the United States since the 1970s. He pointed to large-scale military exercises every year using "nuclear assets" and said what is more dangerous is what he called a US plan to stage a "secret operation aimed at the removal of our supreme leadership". "The entire US mainland is within our firing range and if the US dares to invade our sacred territory even an inch, it will not escape our severe punishment in any part of the globe," he warned. October 16, 2017 'Don't join any US action and you're safe' North Korea warned countries at the United Nations on Monday in a statement: don't join the United States in military action against the Asian state and you will be safe from retaliation. The caution was contained in a copy of North Korean Deputy UN Ambassador Kim In Ryong’s prepared remarks for a discussion on nuclear weapons by a UN General Assembly committee. However, Kim did not read that section out loud. "The entire US mainland is within our firing range and if the US dares to invade our sacred territory even an inch it will not escape our severe punishment in any part of the globe," the statement read. October 15, 2017 Diplomacy to continue until 'first bomb drops' Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Sunday that President Donald Trump had instructed him to continue diplomatic efforts to calm rising tensions with North Korea, saying "those diplomatic efforts will continue until the first bomb drops." Tillerson downplayed messages that President Trump had previously posted on Twitter suggesting Tillerson was wasting his time trying to negotiate with "Little Rocket Man," a derogatory nickname Trump has coined for North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un. October 13, 2017 N. Korea readies missile launch, report says North Korea is believed to be preparing to launch a ballistic missile ahead of an upcoming joint naval drill by the US and South Korea, a news report said Saturday, citing a government source. The US navy said Friday that a US aircraft carrier will lead the drill in the coming week, a fresh show of force against North Korea as tensions soar over the hermit state's weapons programme. The move will likely rile Pyongyang which has previously responded angrily to joint exercises. Malaysia halts imports from North Korea Malaysia, which until recently had been one of Pyongyang’s closest friends, has halted all imports from North Korea, as part of global efforts to cut off funding over its nuclear and missile programmes. Malaysia did not buy any goods from North Korea in June and July, after buying $4.89m worth of goods in the first five months of the year, according to data from the Department of Statistics. October 09, 2017 Kim Jong-un promotes sister Kim Yo-jong North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has promoted his younger sister to a senior post in the one-party state, according to state media. Kim Yo-jong became an alternate member of the party's powerful Politburo, the decision-making body presided over by her brother, the official KCNA news agency said on Sunday. The promotion was announced along with those for dozens of other top officials at a meeting of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea on Saturday in the capital, Pyongyang. Since inheriting power from his father in 2011, Kim has placed his younger sister in various positions in order to strengthen the position of the family within the country's leadership. October 08, 2017 Trump: 'Only one thing will work' US President Donald Trump said that diplomatic efforts with North Korea have consistently failed, adding that "only one thing will work", without elaborating further. Trump has engaged in an escalating war of words with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, trading insults amid rising tensions between the two countries rivals. "Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years, agreements made and massive amounts of money paid," Trump tweeted. It "hasn't worked, agreements violated before the ink was dry, makings fools of US negotiators. Sorry, but only one thing will work!," he said on Twitter. October 03, 2017 Trump: 'Don't bother talking to N Korea' US President Donald Trump dismissed the prospect of talks with North Korea as a waste of time a day after his secretary of state said the United States was maintaining open lines of communication with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. "I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful secretary of state, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with little rocket man," Trump wrote on Twitter, using his sarcastic nickname for Kim and seeming to contradict the top US diplomat. Trump, who has traded insults and threats with Kim in recent weeks amid escalating tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes, later tweeted that his White House predecessors, Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama, had all "failed" on North Korea by "being nice to rocket man". "So why would it work now?" he asked. October 02, 2017 Egypt violated arms embargo A UN investigation has revealed that the Egyptian government violated an international embargo on trading weapons with North Korea. UN and US experts say North Korea has built a vast network of overseas clients to evade international sanctions and sell cheap weapons to a long list of clients across the world. October 01, 2017 North Korea: a 'state nuclear force' North Korea's state news agency has called the US-led effort to impose sanctions over its weapons programme futile, vowing the country inevitably will become a "state nuclear force". The comments on Sunday came from the Korean Central News Agency's website Uriminzokkiri after US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met for talks with China's top diplomats and President Xi Jinping in Beijing on the Korean nuclear crisis. Tillerson has been a proponent of a campaign of "peaceful pressure", using US and UN sanctions and working with China to turn the screw on the regime. September 30, 2017 Tillerson: US in contact with N Korea The US says it has open channels of communication with North Korea and is "probing" whether the Pyongyang government is ready to enter talks on giving up its nuclear weapons programme. Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state, made the remarks on Saturday after an afternoon of talks with China's top diplomats and President Xi Jinping centred on the nuclear crisis and preparations for President Donald Trump's visit to Beijing in November. "We are probing, so stay tuned," Tillerson said. The US is looking to an economic squeeze of North Korea it hopes will compel the country's retreat from nuclear arms and missile programmes. September 28, 2017 South Korea's Armed Forces Day North Korea is being warned by South Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons programme. The South Korean president says reckless provocations will be met with strong retaliation. To emphasise the point, ballistic missiles and other weapons have been on show for Armed Forces Day. China orders close of North Korean firms Beijing has ordered North Korean-owned businesses in China to close by January, cutting foreign revenue for Pyongyang under United Nations sanctions imposed over its nuclear and missile programmes. China's commerce ministry said on Thursday that companies, including joint ventures with Chinese firms, have 120 days to close from the date the UN resolution was adopted on September 11. The sanctions spare, on a case by case basis, entities involved in non-commercial activities or public utility infrastructure projects that do not generate profits. September 26, 2017 US rejects North Korea war allegations as 'absurd' The US has dismissed North Korea's accusation that President Donald Trump has declared war against the country, calling it "absurd". The comments come as South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) said that Pyongyang had moved to bolster its coastal defences by relocating its warplanes along the east coast. Regional and other leaders on Tuesday warned that war on the Korean Peninsula would result in "catastrophic consequences". The warnings came after Pyongyang said on Monday that it was ready to defend itself by shooting down American bombers, and accusing Trump of declaring war on the country. September 25, 2017 Pyongyang: All options on the table for leadership North Korea's foreign minister has accused US President Donald Trump of declaring war on his country. Speaking outside the UN headquarters in New York City on Monday, Ri Yong-ho said Trump's "declaration of war" means all options will be on the table for North Korea's leadership. Stating that his country's ultimate goal is to establish "balance of power" with the US, Ri said his country will never waver from its nuclear ambitions despite UN sanctions. September 23, 2017 China imposes limits on oil supply to North Korea China is limiting its oil exports to North Korea to comply with new sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council last week, which include fuel import restrictions. China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on its website on Saturday that China would limit exports of refined petroleum products from October 1, and ban condensates and liquefied natural gas immediately. China will also ban textile imports from the North Korea, the ministry said. September 22, 2017 Russia tells US, N Korea 'hot heads' to calm down Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has urged "hot heads" to calm down, calling an escalating war of words between US President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un "a kindergarten fight". Trump called the North Korean leader a "madman" on Friday, a day after Kim dubbed him a "mentally deranged US dotard" who would face the "highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history" in retaliation for the US president saying Washington would "totally destroy" the Asian country if it threatened the US or its allies. "We have to calm down the hot heads," Lavrov told reporters at the United Nations on Friday, where world leaders gathered this week for the body's annual General Assembly. "We continue to strive for the reasonable and not the emotional approach ... of the kindergarten fight between children." Pyongyang threatens H-bomb test over Pacific Ocean North Korea says it may test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean after US President Donald Trump threatened to destroy the country, whose leader responded by promising to make a "mentally deranged" Trump pay dearly for his threats. Speaking in New York City on Friday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korea's foreign minister, said his country could consider a hydrogen bomb test on an unprecedented scale on the Pacific Ocean, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. Japan, the only country ever to suffer an atomic attack, described the threat from Ri as "totally unacceptable". Kim Jong-un: 'Deranged' Trump will 'pay dearly' North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has called US President Donald Trump "mentally deranged" and said he would "pay dearly" for the recent threats against his country. In a rare statement directly attributed to the North's leader, Kim said on Friday that Trump is "unfit to hold the prerogative of supreme command of a country", describing the president as "a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire". Hours later, North Korea's foreign minister reportedly said his country might be planning to test a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean to fulfil Kim's vow to take the "highest-level" action against the United States. Kim's statement was carried by the North's official Korean Central News Agency. It responded to Trump's combative speech at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. Ri Yong-ho calls Donald Trump threat a 'dog's bark' North Korea's foreign minister has brushed aside US President Donald Trump's threat to destroy his country, comparing it to a "dog's bark". Trump used his maiden address at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday to warn Pyongyang that Washington would "totally destroy" it if the US or its allies were attacked. Arriving in New York for the UN meetings on Wednesday, Ri Yong-ho, the North Korean foreign minister, was mobbed with questions from reporters about the Trump speech and he replied with a proverb. "There is a saying that marching goes on even when dogs bark," he said as he entered his hotel. "If they are trying to shock us with the sound of a dog's bark they are clearly having a dog dream." Trump signs new order to expand North Korea sanctions US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order allowing Washington to ramp up sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear missile programme. The move on Thursday came two days after Trump warned North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in his address at the UN General Assembly that the US, if threatened, would "totally destroy" his country of 26 million people. Announcing the executive order, Trump said the measure would allow sanctions against "individuals and companies that finance and facilitate trade" with Pyongyang. September 19, 2017 Trump threatens to 'destroy North Korea' if necessary US President Donald Trump has threatened to "totally destroy North Korea" if his country is forced to defend itself or its allies, in a highly-combative debut speech to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Addressing world leaders and representatives from 193 countries gathered in New York, Trump on Tuesday warned that the US would be forced to confront North Korean leader Kim Jong-un if he continued Pyongyang's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons". September 18, 2017 N Korea says sanctions will speed up nuclear programme Stricter international sanctions will only lead North Korea to speed up its nuclear programme, Pyongyang said, as US and Chinese leaders agreed to "maximise the pressure" on the regime of Kim Jong-un. "The increased moves of the US and its vassal forces to impose sanctions and pressure on the DPRK will only increase our pace towards the ultimate completion of the state nuclear force," a statement on North Korean state media said on Monday, using the acronym for the country’s official name, Democratic People's Republic of Korea. September 17, 2017 US: N Korea to be 'destroyed' if behaviour continues The US ambassador to the UN warned North Korea would be destroyed if it continues its "reckless behaviour" and forces the United States and its allies to defend themselves against any attack. Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, said on Sunday the UN Security Council has run out of options on containing North Korea's nuclear programme - and the US may now turn to the Pentagon. "We have pretty much exhausted all the things that we can do at the Security Council at this point," Haley told CNN's State of the Union. Haley added she was perfectly happy to hand the matter to Defence Secretary James Mattis. "We're trying every other possibility that we have, but there's a whole lot of military options on the table," she said. Trump takes aim at N Korea's 'Rocket Man' on Twitter US President Donald Trump has referred to North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un as "Rocket Man" - and pictured himself taking out his former election rival Hillary Clinton with a golf ball. Trump spoke on Saturday night with South Korea's President Moon Jae-in, pledging joint "steps to strengthen deterrence and defence capabilities and to maximise economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea", according to the White House. Trump's account of the conversation, which kicked off an unbridled salvo of early morning tweets on Sunday, struck a less diplomatic tone. "I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad!" the president wrote to his 38 million followers. He then launched into half a dozen retweets of internet memes celebrating his Make America Great Again campaign theme. September 16, 2017 Kim Jong-un vows to complete N Korea nuclear programme North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has vowed to complete his nuclear weapons programme in the face of strengthening sanctions after he inspected a powerful new intermediate-range missile that was fired over Japan, according to state news agency KCNA. KCNA said North Korea's goal is reaching an "equilibrium" of military force with the United States and to "make the US rulers dare not talk about military option for the DPRK". Pyongyang had fired its second missile over Japan in less than a month on Friday, prompting the United States to say it has military options to deal with the North. September 15, 2017 North Korea missile test angers Japan, South Korea World leaders have condemned North Korea after it conducted its longest-ever test flight of a ballistic missile, with some calling for even tougher sanctions. Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, called on the international community to band together after the projectile flew over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido before falling into the Pacific Ocean on Friday. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in ordered his military to conduct a live-fire ballistic missile drill. The White House said US President Donald Trump had been briefed on the latest launch. Trump wants China to do more to rein in North Korea. China, in turn, favours an international response to the problem. Taiwan convened a national security meeting, amid fears of a deterioration in regional security after North Korea's latest missile launch. North Korea fires ballistic missile over Japan North Korea has fired a ballistic missile from the capital Pyongyang that has flown northern Japan. Yoshihide Sug, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, said t he projectile was launched at 6:57am local time on Friday (21:57 GMT Thursday) and flew over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido before falling into the Pacific Ocean - 2,000km east of Cape Erimo. "Japan protests the latest launch in the strongest terms and will take appropriate and timely action at the United Nations and elsewhere, staying in close contact with the United States and South Korea," Suga said . South Korea's defence ministry said the missile travelled about 3,700km and reached a maximum altitude of 770km - both higher and further than previous tests. The ministry said the South's military conducted a live-fire ballistic missile drill in response to the North's launch. September 14, 2017 North Korea threatens US, Japan over UN sanctions North Korea threatened to sink Japan and reduce the US to "ashes and darkness" for leading the latest UN Security Council sanctions imposed on the country. Reacting to the UN Security Council vote, North Korea said the US ought to "be beaten to death" for spearheading the penalties. September 13, 2017 N Korea: US will 'suffer greatest pain' over sanctions North Korea has said the US will "suffer the greatest pain" over its role in bringing forth the latest sanctions on Pyongyang. "The forthcoming measures ... will make the US suffer the greatest pain it ever experienced in its history," North Korea's Ambassador to the UN Han Tae Song said on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Pyongyang also called the sanctions a "heinous provocation aimed at depriving the DPRK of its legitimate right for self-defence and completely suffocating its state and people through full-scale economic blockade," according to a statement from the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). DPRK stands for North Korea's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The statement also said that the sanctions "verify that the road [North Korea] chose to go down was absolutely right and to strengthen its resolve to follow this road at a faster pace without the slightest diversion until this right to finish is over". September 12, 2017 Trump: Fresh sanctions on N Korea only 'a very small step' US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the latest UN sanctions on North Korea were only a very small step and nothing compared to what would have to happen to deal with the country's nuclear programme. "We think it's just another very small step, not a big deal," Trump told reporters at the start of a meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. "I don't know if it has any impact, but certainly it was nice to get a 15-to-nothing vote, but those sanctions are nothing compared to what ultimately will have to happen," said Trump, who has vowed not to allow North Korea to develop a nuclear missile capable of hitting the United States. S Korea welcomes new UNSC sanctions on North South Korea has welcomed the UN Security Council's move to impose new sanctions on its neighbour North Korea , describing it as a "strict warning from the international community". The country's foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that South Korea will continue to strengthen cooperation with the international community to ensure that the resolutions "are thoroughly implemented". "North Korea should accept the strict warning from the international community that continued provocations only deepen the diplomatic isolation and economic pressure," the ministry said. September 11, 2017 UN Security Council slaps new sanctions on North Korea The UN Security Council has unanimously adopted a US-drafted resolution imposing new sanctions on North Korea following its sixth and largest nuclear test. With backing from China and Russia, the council voted 15-0 on Monday to slap a ban on textile exports and restrict shipments of oil products to North Korea. The resolution is a watered-down version of the original US proposal. September 10, 2017 UN experts: N Korea recently exported $270m illegally UN experts have said North Korea illegally exported coal, iron and other commodities worth at least $270 million to China and other countries including India, Malaysia and Sri Lanka during a six-month period ending in August in violation of UN sanctions. The report, released on Saturday by the experts monitoring sanctions, said Kim Jong-un's government continues to flout sanctions on commodities, an arms embargo and shipping and financial restrictions. September 9, 2017 US formally requests UN vote on North Korea sanctions The US has formally requested a UN Security Council vote on Monday on the toughest sanctions yet against North Korea despite resistance from China and Russia, as Pyongyang's state media calls for a nuclear arms buildup. Washington has presented a draft UN resolution calling for an oil embargo on North Korea, an assets freeze on leader Kim Jong-un, a ban on textile exports and an end to payments of North Korean guest workers. Diplomatic sources said Russia and China opposed the measures as a whole, except for the ban on textiles, during a meeting on Friday of experts from the 15 Security Council members. September 8, 2017 North Korea: 'More gift packages' coming for the US North Korea has threatened to send "more gift packages" to the United States, days after testing the biggest nuclear weapon it has ever detonated. Han Tae-song, ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to the United Nations in Geneva, addressed the UN-sponsored Conference on Disarmament on Tuesday after his country carried out its sixth nuclear test. "The recent self-defence measures by my country, DPRK, are a gift package addressed to none other than the US," Han said. "The US will receive more gift packages from my country as long as it relies on reckless provocations and futile attempts to put pressure on the DPRK," he added without elaborating. Putin opposes military action against North Korea Russia's President Vladimir Putin has criticised US diplomacy in the crisis and renewed his call for talks, saying North Korea would not halt its missile testing programme until it felt secure. "Russia condemns North Korea's exercises; we consider that they are a provocation ... [But] ramping up military hysteria will lead to nothing good. It could lead to a global catastrophe," Putin said. South Korea conducts live-fire naval drills South Korea's navy has conducted a live-fire exercise in waters off the country's eastern coast as Seoul continued its displays of military capability following North Korea's latest nuclear test. Seoul's defence ministry said that warships participated in drills aimed at retaliating against potential North Korean provocations. Seoul says more naval drills are planned from Wednesday to Saturday in the country's southern seas. September 4, 2017 US calls for UN vote on fresh North Korea sanctions The US ambassador to the United Nations has said North Korea's leadership is "begging for war" as she called on the body's Security Council to impose tougher measures against the country following its most powerful nuclear test to date. At an emergency session in New York, the second in a week, Nikki Haley said Washington will circulate a new sanctions resolution this week, with a view of voting on it next Monday. The US envoy urged the 15-member group to adopt the strongest possible measures to deter North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. S Korea to temporarily deploy four remaining THAAD launchers South Korea said on Monday it will temporarily deploy four remaining launchers for a US THAAD missile defence system after the completion of an environmental assessment by the government. Some construction would be carried out to deploy the four launchers at the site in Seongju, south of Seoul, the defence ministry said in a statement. There are currently two launchers at the location, a former golf course. The ministry did not specify when the launchers would be moved onto the site. UN Security Council sets second meeting on N Korea blast The UN Security Council is holding its second emergency meeting in a week about North Korea on Monday after a powerful nuclear test explosion added another layer of urgency for diplomats wrestling with what to do about the North's weapons programmes. The emergency session comes six days after the council strongly condemned Pyongyang's "outrageous" launch of a ballistic missile over Japan. Requested by the US, Japan, France, Britain and South Korea, the Security Council meeting could bring additional condemnation and discussion of other potential steps. Australia calls on China to influence N Korea Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has called on China to bring North Korea to its "senses" following its nuclear test on Sunday. He said China will be enforcing UN economic sanctions against North Korea but "there will be more that needs to be done given the affront that North Korea has shown to China" by testing its sixth nuclear device on Sunday. Turnbull told reporters in Canberra that the risk of war breaking out on the Korean Peninsula is at its highest in over 60 years. He said China, as the North's closest ally and commercial partner, had the economic leverage to and therefore the responsibility to influence North Korea. Japan FM agrees with US on 'close cooperation' over N Korea Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said he and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson agreed to cooperate closely in order to exert pressure on North Korea through the United Nations. "We agreed on close cooperation between Japan and the United States to exert maximum pressure on North Korea and the UN, including the adoption of Security Council resolutions," Kono told reporters after a phone call with Tillerson. S Korea to announce approval of environment report for Thaad system South Korea's environment ministry will announce on Monday its approval of an environmental assessment report for the deployment of a US anti-missile defence system in the country, a ministry official told Reuters news agency. South Korea said in June that it will hold off installing remaining components of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) until it completes an assessment of the system's impact on the environment. The ministry will hold a briefing on the decision at 06:30 GMT on Monday, the official said. Trump reaffirms commitment to defend allies in call with Abe US President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe condemned in a phone call North Korea's "continued destabilising and provocative actions," the White House said. Trump also reaffirmed that Washington would defend itself and its allies "using the full range of diplomatic, conventional, and nuclear capabilities at [its] disposal". S Korea simulates attack on North's nuclear test site South Korea has carried out a missile drill meant to "strongly warn" North Korea over its sixth nuclear test , military officials said. According to state news agency Yonhap, "the training came in response to the North's sixth nuclear test ... and involved the country's Hyunmoo ballistic missile and the F-15K fighter jets". The military added that the target of the exercise was set considering the distance to where the North's test site was and the drill was aimed at practicing precision strikes and cutting off reinforcements. The drill was carried out by only the Korean military, but more are being prepared with the US forces in South Korea, a military statement said. September 3, 2017 US: Threats 'will be met with massive military response' US Secretary of Defense James Mattis said any threat to the US or its allies will be met with a "massive military response, a response both effective and overwhelming". Mattis said Washington was not looking for the "total annihilation of a country, namely North Korea, but ... [it has] many options to do so". UN Security Council to meet Monday on N Korea nuclear test The United Nations Security Council will meet at 14:00 GMT on Monday to discuss North Korea's nuclear test. The meeting comes at the request of the US, Japan, Britain, France and South Korea, according to the US mission to the UN. Trump: US may stop trade with countries doing business with N Korea In a tweet on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said the US is "considering ... stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea". Such a move could have a big impact on China, a key provider of aid and trade to the North, and which is seen as the only country holding any real influence over its truculent neighbour. The United States is considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2017 // <![CDATA[ // ]]]] > UN chief: Nuclear test is 'profoundly destabilising' UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned North Korea's nuclear test, saying it is "profoundly destabilising for regional security". He also called on the country's leadership to cease such acts, his spokesman said in a statement. World leaders unite in condemnation of North Korea President Donald Trump has reacted to what he called "a major nuclear test" by North Korea, branding the North "a rogue nation" whose "words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous" to the United States. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on Sunday to "appropriately deal with" the latest nuclear test by North Korea, state news agency Xinhua said. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO's secretary-general, called on North Korea in a statement to "immediately cease all existing nuclear and ballistic missile activities in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner, and re-engage in dialogue with the international community". South Korea's President Moon Jae-in vowed to push for the most powerful sanctions yet at the UN Security Council against North Korea to completely isolate it. Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, said Pyongyang's "nuclear and missile development programmes pose a new level of a grave and immediate threat" and "seriously undermines the peace and security of the region". TIMELINE: North's nuclear tests North Korea confirms sixth nuclear test Pyongyang has confirmed its sixth nuclear test after reports of tremors shaking the country. The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said the hydrogen bomb test on Sunday morning, ordered by leader Kim Jong-un, was a "perfect success". The trial at 12pm (03:30 GMT) was carried out to "examine and confirm the accuracy and credibility" of North Korea's technology, KCNA said. EXPLAINED: H-bomb vs atomic bomb Tremors in North Korea raise fears of nuclear test Two tremors struck North Korea on Sunday, prompting fears that Pyongyang may have conducted a nuclear test. The website of the US Geological Survey said the first tremor of 6.3 magnitude had a depth of 23 kilometres. The USGS had earlier reported a 5.2 magnitude and depth of zero kilometres. Trump, Abe discuss 'growing threat' from North Korea US President Donald Trump spoke with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan to discuss the "growing threat" posed by North Korea, which carried out two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July. "The two leaders reaffirmed the importance of close cooperation between the United States, Japan, and South Korea in the face of the growing threat from North Korea," a White House readout of the call said. It did not specify whether the two leaders spoke before or after Pyongyang claimed via its state news agency that it had developed a hydrogen bomb which can be loaded into the new missile. North Korea says it has a missile-ready hydrogen bomb North Korea has said it has developed a more advanced nuclear weapon that has "great destructive power" and can be loaded onto an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The North's official KCNA news agency on Sunday showed Kim Jong-un inspecting what it said was a hydrogen bomb that is to be loaded into a new ICBM. There will be some skepticism about the claim from experts about Pyongyang's assertion that it has mastered hydrogen technology. September 2, 2017 Trump, Moon pledge strong diplomatic pressure on N Korea US President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in pledged to continue to apply strong diplomatic and economic pressure on North Korea, the White House said in a statement. The two leaders spoke by phone on Friday and also agreed on revising a bilateral missile treaty. The treaty currently caps the development of South Korea's ballistic missiles to a range of 800km and a payload weight of 500kg. August 29, 2017 UN condemns missile tests The UN Security Council unanimously condemned North Korea's firing of a ballistic missile over Japan as an "outrageous" threat and demanded that the country not launch any more missiles and abandon all nuclear weapons and programmes. In a statement, the Security Council said it was of "vital importance" that North Korea take immediate, concrete actions to reduce tensions and called on all states to implement UN sanctions on North Korea . Hwasong-12 flies over Japan North Korea has fired a ballistic missile that flew over Japan before plunging into the northern Pacific Ocean, in a step termed by the Japanese prime minister as a " grave threat". The launch appeared to be the first to cross over Japan since 2009 and comes amid an ongoing annual military drill being carried out between the United States and its close ally in the region, South Korea . August 26, 2017 Missile launch fails Three North Korea short-range ballistic missiles failed on Saturday, a temporary blow to Pyongyang's rapid nuclear and missile expansion, US military officials said. The US Pacific Command said in a statement that two of North Korea's missiles failed in flight after an unspecified distance, and another appeared to have exploded immediately. It added that the missile posed no threat to the US territory of Guam, towards which North Korea had previously warned it would fire missiles. August 22, 2017 N Korea vows 'merciless retaliation' over drills North Korea on Tuesday greeted the start of annual US-South Korean military drills with fiery threats, threatening "merciless retaliation" for exercises the country claims are an invasion rehearsal. North Korea's military routinely responds to US-South Korean exercises. Tuesday's threat came as top US generals, including Harry Harris, the commander of US forces in the Pacific, visited South Korea . August 21, 2017 US, S Korea drills begin US and South Korean troops have begun military drills amid heated warnings by North Korea that the exercises will worsen tensions in the region. The Ulchi Freedom Guardian drills, which began on Monday, are largely computer-simulated war games. The exercise brings together as many as 50,000 South Korean soldiers and approximately 17,500 US service members for a simulation of war on the Korean Peninsula. August 20, 2017 N Korea slams US-South drills North Korea has warned the US will be "pouring gasoline on fire" by conducting annual war games with South Korea amid heightened tensions between North Korea and the US. The Ulchi Freedom Guardian military exercises involving thousands of American and South Korean troops are to begin on Monday. North Korea views the drills as a highly provocative rehearsal for an invasion. August 18, 2017 N Korea 'fails' South's Moon North Korea's state media gave the South's President Moon Jae-in a "fail" grade on Friday for his first 100 days in office, dismissing his proffered olive branches as "hypocrisy". Moon, elected to replace impeached President Park Geun-hye , came into office in May and has since had to deal with tensions over North Korea's missile and nuclear programmes. August 17, 2017 Moon: There will not be war South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has ruled out a "war again on the Korean Peninsula" and is considering sending a special envoy to North Korea for talks if Pyongyang stops its missile and nuclear tests. Moon's comments on Thursday, marking his 100 days in office, come amid increased tensions between the United States and North Korea following Pyongyang's warning that it might send missiles into waters near the US territory of Guam. August 16, 2017 UN: Time to 'dial down rhetoric' UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said it was time to "dial down rhetoric and dial up diplomacy" on North Korea , offering to help broker talks with the parties involved in the dispute. "My good offices are always available - and I conveyed this message yesterday to the representatives of the six-party talks," Guterres said on Wednesday amid growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula since Pyongyang conducted ballistic missile tests last month. "The solution to this crisis must be political. The potential consequences of military action are too horrific to even contemplate." N Korea holds fire on Guam Kim Jong-un ordered the army to be ready to launch should he make the decision for military action. Kim said the US should make the right choice "in order to defuse the tensions and prevent the dangerous military conflict on the Korean Peninsula". The visit to the Korean People's Army Strategic Force marks Kim's first public appearance in about two weeks. August 15, 2017 China calls for de-escalation China has warned the United States and North Korea to "hit the brakes" on threats and actions, and work towards a peaceful resolution of their dispute. Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in a phone conversation with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday, said the two countries should work together and contain tensions. Russia and China should not permit any party to "stir up an incident on their doorstep", he said. August 13, 2017 'Nothing imminent' in standoff with N Korea CIA director Mike Pompeo has offered assurances there is "nothing imminent" in the US standoff with nuclear-armed North Korea but said he would not be surprised if Pyongyang conducts another missile test. Asked how worried people should be, Pompeo told Fox News on Sunday: "There's nothing imminent today. But make no mistake about it. The increased chance that there will be a nuclear missile in Denver is a very serious threat." August 13, 2017 Pastor arrives in Canada A Canadian pastor who was imprisoned for more than two years in North Korea has arrived back home. Hyeon Lim, a 62-year-old South Korean-born Canadian citizen, was convicted and sentenced in 2015 for allegedly trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system and helping US and South Korean authorities lure and abduct North Korean citizens. Hyeon's release came nearly two months after US college student Otto Warmbier died shortly after he was released from North Korea in a coma. Warmbier had been sentenced to 15 years of hard labour in March 2016 after being accused of stealing a propaganda poster. August 12, 2017 China urges Trump to change rhetoric Chinese leader Xi Jinping urged US President Donald Trump on Saturday to avoid rhetoric that could inflame tensions with North Korea as an escalating war of words raised global alarm. Xi made the plea in a phone call hours after Trump escalated his warnings to North Korea, saying it would "truly regret" taking hostile action against the US . China's foreign ministry said Xi urged Trump to avoid "words and deeds" that would "exacerbate" the already tense situation, exercise restraint, and seek a political settlement. August 11, 2017 Beijing's stance on North Korea A Chinese state-run newspaper has suggested Beijing would "stay neutral" if North Korea attacks first in a conflict with the United States , despite a mutual defence pact between the Asian allies. However, it added: "If the US and South Korea carry out strikes and try to overthrow the North Korean regime and change the political pattern of the Korean Peninsula, China will prevent them from doing so." 'Tension could lead to catastrophe' Any new military conflict with North Korea would likely escalate to the use of nuclear weapons, bringing catastrophic casualties not seen since World War II , defence officials and analysts say. North Korea upped the ante by saying it would complete plans by mid-August to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land near the US Pacific. Trump escalates threats President Donald Trump warned Kim Jong-un's government to "get their act together" or face extraordinary "trouble", and suggested his earlier threat to unleash "fire and fury" on North Korea was too mild. "Maybe that statement wasn't tough enough," Trump said, in the latest US salvo in an escalating exchange of threats between the nuclear-armed nations. August 10, 2017 Guam governor warns North Korea "Any type of attack will not be successful but at the same time an attack on Guam will be considered an attack on the United States and will be met with an overwhelming force," Guam's Governor Eddie Calvo told Al Jazeera. The people of Guam woke up on Thursday to another pointed threat from Pyongyang, which vowed to complete a plan to attack waters near the island by mid-August. August 9, 2017 Pentagon warns against conflict initiation US Defence Secretary James Mattis has responded to North Korea's threat of targeting the US Pacific territory of Guam with missiles, saying Pyongyang's move would lead to "the end of its regime and the destruction of its people". Mattis said in a statement on Wednesday that North Korea "would lose any arms race or conflict it initiates". "The DPRK must choose to stop isolating itself and stand down its pursuit of nuclear weapons," he said, using the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Earlier on Wednesday, a spokesman for the Korean People's Army said in a statement carried by North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency that the Guam attack plan would be "put into practice in a multi-current and consecutive way any moment" after leader Kim Jong-un made a decision. 'Threat of new nuclear attack growing' The fear of another nuclear bomb attack is growing on the 72nd anniversary of the US atomic bombing of Nagasaki, Japan , the city's mayor said, apparently referring to the North Korean nuclear threat in the region. Tomihisa Taue urged nuclear states to abandon such weapons and criticised Japan's government for not taking part in the global efforts towards a nuclear ban. Taue also criticised Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government for what he said were empty promises about working to achieve a nuclear-free world. N Korea threatens missile attack on Guam "North Korea had best not make any more threats to the United States," said a stern-looking Trump , seated with his arms crossed and with his wife beside him, at his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. "They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen." North Korea said it is "carefully examining" a plan to attack the US Pacific territory of Guam with missiles, just hours after Trump's comments. A spokesman for the Korean People's Army, in a statement carried by North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency, said the attack plan will be "put into practice in a multi-current and consecutive way any moment" once leader Kim Jong-un makes a decision. In another statement, quoting a different military spokesman, North Korea also said it could carry out a pre-emptive operation if the US showed signs of provocation. August 7, 2017 North Korea rejects sanctions The sanctions passed at the weekend were a "violent violation of our sovereignty", Pyongyang said in a statement carried by its official Korean Central News Agency, adding it would take "righteous action" in return. North Korea said it would not negotiate over nuclear arms while threatened by the US. China , a close ally of North Korea, also voted in favour of the sanctions. Several Asian foreign ministers, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, are currently gathered in the Philippine capital, Manila, for an ASEAN regional summit. August 6, 2017 UN sanctions The Security Council unanimously adopted the US-led resolution, which bans mineral and seafood exports worth more than $1bn. The United States , China, Japan and South Korea have all welcomed the new UN sanctions. Japan said it was time to exert more "effective pressure" on Pyongyang rather than to pursue dialogue. August 4, 2017 US unveils new UN sanctions The United States presented to the UN Security Council a draft resolution toughening sanctions on North Korea , aiming to deprive Pyongyang of $1bn in export revenue, a council diplomat said. The council is expected to vote on Saturday on the measures that include a ban on exports of coal, iron and iron ore, lead and lead ore, as well as seafood by the cash-starved state. The US has been negotiating the measures with China , North Korea's main trading partner and ally, since Pyongyang launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4.

The blast follows a series of attacks in or around Kabul this month [Massoud Hossaini/AP] A suicide bomber has detonated explosives in the diplomatic area of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, killing at least three people and wounding 14 others, health officials said. The attack on Tuesday took place at the 14th street of Wazir Akbar Khan area, close to the defence ministry, police said. Ismail Kawoosi, spokesman for Afghanistan's public health ministry, said the wounded were taken to hospital for treatment. Witnesses told Al Jazeera that the blast had caused more than 10 casualties. A defence ministry spokesman told Al Jazeera that the blast happened outside their building. It was not immediately clear what the target of the attack was. Earlier local media reports had suggested the attack targeted the Australian embassy, which is also in the same area. A series of attacks in Kabul this month, including one at a Shia mosque, killed more than 70 people. In May, a massive truck bomb blast ripped through the diplomatic district, killing at least 80 people and wounding hundreds in a powerful explosion described by officials as "one of the biggest" to have hit the capital of Afghanistan .

Israeli soldiers patrol near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip [Menahem Kahana/AFP] At least seven Palestinians have been killed after Israeli forces destroyed a tunnel in a southern town of the Gaza Strip, in an attack described by the besieged enclave's rulers as a dangerous escalation. Ashraf al-Qidra, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health in Gaza , said that nine others were also wounded in the Khan Younis area and were taken to the nearby al-Aqsa Hospital for treatment. The ministry officially identified five of those killed as members of the al-Quds Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad: Brigade Commander Arafat Marshood, Deputy Commander Hasan Abu Hasanein, Ahmad Khalil Abu Armaneh, 25, Omar Nassar Al-Falit, 27 and Jihad al-Samiri. The two others killed were identified as 30-year-old Masbah Shbeer and Mohammed al-Agha, 22 - both members of Hamas' Izz Eddine al-Qassam Brigades. The health ministy said the number of those killed could increase significantly due to the large number of people still missing. "We affirm our right to respond to the aggression of the occupation today," the Islamic Jihad Movement said in a statement later on Monday. "The occupation government must be aware that we will continue to work to strengthen our capabilities to protect our people," it added. Hamas, which rules Gaza, said in a post on Twitter that the attack constitutes "a new war against Gaza people". Palestinian media reported that the tunnel had been hit by the Israeli air force. "Reports said Israel fired five missiles at the tunnel that was being dug east of Khan Younis and which Israel claims was leading to its territory," Palestinian news agency Wafa said. Israeli officials said that the tunnel near the border wall, which was in the process of being built, was blown up after being monitored for some time. Since 2008, Israel has launched three offensives on the Gaza Strip. The latest one, code-named Operation Protective Edge, took place in the summer of 2014 and resulted in the deaths of more than 2,200 Palestinians. Sixty-six Israeli soldiers and seven Israeli non-combatants were killed in the same period. The Israeli blockade of the occupied Gaza Strip, in its current form, has been in place since June 2007. Israel controls Gaza's airspace and territorial waters, as well as two of the three border crossing points; the third is controlled by Egypt.

Fighting in Marawi killed more than 1,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands [Reuters] An Indonesian man, who reportedly played a role in the 2016 attacks in Jakarta , has been arrested near the southern Philippine city of Marawi, where fighters loyal to ISIL fought with the military for five months. Muhammad Ilham Syaputra was caught on Wednesday while trying to escape from a district in Marawi, where several fighters of the Maute group are in hiding, according to police. Syaputra reportedly attempted to evade authorities by swimming across Lake Lanao to a town adjacent to Marawi. {articleGUID} His "foreign" appearance raised suspicion among residents who reported him to police. John Guyguyon, chief of police in Lanao del Sur, where Marawi is located, said Syaputra told investigators he is from northern Sumatra in Indonesia, and he came to the Philippines as early as November 2016 to take part in the planned Marawi siege. Police seized from the suspect a .45 calibre handgun, some Indonesian passports, different currencies and jewellery. During the interrogation, Syaputra also reportedly claimed to have played a role in the 2016 attacks in Jakarta's central business district, which left seven people dead, including attackers. Syaputra was reportedly among the dozens of foreign fighters from neighbouring Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as from Arab countries, who came to Marawi to join the fight. The number of fighters, however, remains unclear. In recent weeks, police also killed the suspected "financier" of the siege, Mahmud Ahmad, a doctor and a Malaysian national. Guyguyon said the arrest is a "big blow" to the ISIL-linked fighters, even though he warned others could still launch retaliatory attacks.

An Al Jazeera 101 East investigation also revealed the fighters had planned the siege for more than a year . More than 1,000 combatants, including foreign fighters, as well as civilians were killed in the fighting, which also displaced as many as 600,000 people in and around Marawi . On October 23, President Rodrigo Duterte declared the fighting over following the death of Hapilon and Omarkhayam. Hapilon had a $5m bounty on his head issued by the US government. The government of the Philippines has also offered $200,000 for his capture, and a separate $100,000 for Omarkhayam. The other Maute brothers have either been killed or arrested, while their parents have also been detained and charged with aiding the fighters. While the fighting is now over, analysts warn the attackers could return with a vengeance.

The Syrian army claimed to have recaptured Deir Az Zor from ISIL on Friday [File: George Ourfalian/AFP/Getty Images] At least 75 people, including women and children, have been killed in a car bomb planted by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group in eastern Syria, according to a monitoring group. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Sunday that more than 140 people were also injured in Sunday's attack in the suburbs of Deir Az Zor. The Observatory said that members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces were also killed in the attack that comes days after the eastern city was reportedy captured by the Syrian army. "The attack took place on the road known as the traders road, which is used to transport food supplies to the areas under the countrol of the 'Islamic State,'" the group said in a statement. Those that were targeted in the attack were likely fleeing the fighting that had recently taken place in the city of Deir Az Zor. The city had almost been entirely controlled by ISIL, also known as ISIS, since 2014. It is the main city of the oil-rich province of the same name. {articleGUID} The campaign to retake the city began in September when Syrian forces managed to break the three-year siege. On Friday, the Syrian army announced through state media it had completely recaptured the city from the group. According to the Observatory, ISIL still controls about 40 percent of Deir Az Zor province. The Syrian army and Kurdish-led forces supported by the United States are in a race to retake the rest of the eastern province. The forces of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad have been backed by Russian air raids since September 2015, helping to turn the tide in the war against ISIL and other armed groups.

Syria has become the world's most dangerous country for journalists. More than 200 media personnel have been killed since the start of the war, six years ago. Dozens are in prisons or have been kidnapped by armed groups, including ISIL , and many are still missing. According to senior UNESCO official, Frank La Rue, impunity had led to more abuses against journalists. "UNESCO is concerned that impunity damages whole societies by covering up serious human rights abuses, corruption, and crime," he said.

Oceti Sakowin camp, North Dakota - Winter can be stark and dangerous on the Great Plains of North America. Blizzards come unexpectedly. When they do, everything changes. Winds literally howl. Snow doesn’t just drift gently down. It lashes horizontally over a flat landscape, whiting out roads and blinding those who venture outside. Temperatures plummet to Arctic lows in a matter of minutes. That’s what people at this camp have discovered - twice in the past seven days. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5238338864001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5238338864001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > What's next for North Dakota pipeline protesters? PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Thousands of them have come to camp out at the confluence of the Cannonball and Missouri Rivers to support the Standing Rock Sioux nation and its efforts to stop the Dakota Access crude oil pipeline from cross the water upstream of their reservation. They won somewhat of a victory on Sunday December 4 when the US Army Corps of engineers denied the pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners, permission to dig the pipe under the Missouri River. New routes would be researched, said the Corps press release. But even as campers - they call themselves water protectors - celebrated into the evening, the skies filled with snow-laden clouds and what had been a gentle breeze began to blow harder and harder. Roads from the hollow where the camp sits became clogged with cars as people tried to drive to shelter. That pelting snow driven by prairie gusts can polish ice on the highway to skating rink slipperiness. As many drivers discovered to their cost. Dozens of vehicles skidded into the roadside deeps One of them was Ember Arthen, from Leverett, Massachusetts, on the US Northeast coast. We found her Toyota SUV fishtailed into a drift in 60km winds and white out conditions, between the camp and the nearest city, Bismarck, North Dakota. READ MORE: Sioux leader urges Dakota pipeline protesters to leave She was okay, and had thought herself experienced enough in winter driving after coping with the many snowfalls in her home state. But that polishing effect on a plains highway caught her by surprise. "I was going around a stuck vehicle and I just started to slide and there I was, stuck myself," she says. "I was hoping to stay two more weeks at least in camp, but not in these conditions." Ember said the nighttime temperatures were fiercely cold and the snow was heavy enough to collapse even her winter grade tent. There had even been a small fire when a tent canvas roof touched a woodstove. No one was hurt. "The mood is good," she says, "but wary. It’s getting colder this week." For the tribal chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, David Archambault, the weather means one thing: people should disband the camp and go home. He thanked the thousands who’d supported his people since the protests began, but worried that it was getting dangerous out there. "If you’re hearing this message," Archambault said, "you understand that’s now it’s time to go home. If [your support] is needed in the future, you’re welcome to come back. But I don’t think that you have put anybody in an unsafe situation. Go home for the holidays and be with your loved ones." Interestingly, that’s not quite what camp organisers are saying. IN PICTURES: Protesters celebrate as army halts Dakota pipeline work While warning those at Oceti Sakowin and outlying camps that winter is severe and dangerous, they’re asking people who are adequately prepared to stay on and keep an eye on the pipeline construction project. Each night, and even on cloudy days, the blazing spotlights that mark the pipeline route on hills near the Missouri River seem to mock the protesters. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5235446276001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5235446276001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > North Dakota pipeline halted PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Camp spokesman John Bigelow, who is a member of the standing rock Sioux Nation, said that as long the lights blazed and law enforcement vehicles lined the hills, people should stay. "As water protectors, we have a responsibility to be stewards of the water. We’re not going any where," he said. "Only when the [pipeline company] says they’ve stopped the drilling and called off the project, only then will we wrap the camp." Yet there is a problem. Sleeping in flimsy, summer-grade tents, without stoves, or even worse, sleeping in cars, is simply not an option any more. Temperatures in early to mid-December are scheduled to hit record lows. Signs on camp lavatories list the symptoms of hypothermia, and camp medics make rounds of the tents often to make sure people are staying warm. REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: Standing Rock - Thousands rejoice as army denies pipeline permit There’s plenty of donated food and people to cook it. Fires are always burning somewhere. And those who have set up more elaborate shelters - Plains Native teepees with chimneys belching smoke, yurts from Mongolia or even wooden buildings insulated with straw or foam - have been welcoming of temporary guests seeking warmth. Many of those who are maintaining a presence are Native Americans, the Sioux, Cheyenne, Cherokee, Ojibwe and many other nations. Centuries of interaction with US governments and broken treaties have only strengthened their determination to struggle for their rights. Much depends on the incoming Donald Trump administration and whether it tries quickly to restore the pipeline project to its original route. Or if the Energy Transfer Partners company blatantly disregards the denial of permission and simply keeps drilling a tunnel through the bedrock. If either of those happen, expect the confrontation to resume at Oceti Sakowin camp. Police, fearing this, are still blocking a highway and holding high ground north of the camp. Whatever happens, this dispute is far from over. SOURCE: Al Jazeera News ABOUT THE AUTHOR Daniel Lak Canada Correspondent Environment Weather Protests Human Rights United States

But our plight was nothing compared with the massive amount of people currently trapped in their homes. Houston rescue workers responded to more than 1,000 calls for help overnight, turning roads into boat ramps and telling people to get to their roofs. Later, another 1,000 calls for rescue were waiting to be answered. City leaders are calling on residents with boats to help their neighbours. Large trucks normally used for city sanitation have been commandeered to join the overwhelmed rescue fleet. I asked a wet man walking along the highway where he was going. He said his car had been flooded and now he was trying to get home to his wife and two children. The water was to their patio, he said, and he feared in the coming hours his trapped family would be in danger. With the roads closed, he was going to walk 15km to reach them.

Gladys Ngwenya, 70, and Alice Ndlovu, 60, sit in a makeshift clinic at Sipepa Rural Hospital where a temporary camp has been set up for people displaced by floods [Tendai Marima/Al Jazeera] FAST FACTS: ZIMBABWE'S FLOODS Tropical Storm Dineo made landfall in Mozambique in February It moved across parts of southern Africa leaving a path of destruction In Zimbabwe more than 70 bridges were damaged More than 250 people have died The government declared the floods a national disaster and is seeking more than $100m to repair infrastructure Sibhula, Zimbabwe - Musa Ndlovu, 97, Sehelo Msebele, 35, and Siphiwenkosi Ndlovu, 20, are standing at the bank of a fast-flowing river. The three women are preparing to return home after a day spent grinding maize. But since heavy rainfall triggered by Tropical Storm Dineo , which left a trail of destruction across parts of southern Africa, damaged the bridge that crossed the Hovi River, that has meant wading and swimming through the river's brown water. For the women live in the village of Sibhula, a remote settlement that is home to 1,000 people, 550km south-west of the capital, Harare, and which for more than three weeks has been trapped by two flooded rivers that run parallel to it; the Hovi and the Maleme. Malamulela Ncube, 17, steps forward as one of the women balances a sack of ground maize on his shoulder. He wades through the river to return the sack to their village. He will do the same thing with the three remaining sacks. As he places the fourth on his shoulder, the three women follow his lead, hiking up their skirts and dipping their shoeless feet into the river. One by one, they wade in. Joining hands, they move in a curved line that pushes against the current. At times they fall backwards into the water, but they get up again and keep on moving until they reach the other side. Driven by desperation, the villagers must gamble with the waters, swimming against the rapid currents, to go in search of food, medicine and other basic necessities. The army has airdropped two flood relief consignments into Sibhula which included maize grain - but the villagers must cross the river to reach the grinding mill. Wellington Ncube, 38, is one of the men who regularly swims across the Hovi to and from Sibhula. He is delivering a bag of food and some money rolled between his lips [Tendai Marima/Al Jazeera] A perilous crossing The three women have each ground 20kg of maize, the country's staple, into mealie meal. Sebele hopes to feed her family of five for up to two weeks on the cornmeal by carefully rationing it into two meals a day - porridge in the morning and sadza, a thicker, doughy version eaten as a main meal. But once the two weeks are up, Sebele and Ndlovu say they are willing to cross the river again if the bridge has not been fixed. People are crying with this water, they don't know what to do. The hospital and the grinding mill are on this side so we have to come or we'll have nothing to eat ... Musa Ndlovu, the village head of Sibhula "People are crying with this water, they don't know what to do," says Ndlovu. "The hospital and the granding mill are on the other side of the river. "We'll have nothing to eat [if we do not cross]," the 97-year-old adds. "It's dangerous to cross the water like this, but there's nothing we can do, we need to survive." She is aware of the risk she is taking. But, like Sebele, she feels it's riskier not to cross. The flooding of the rivers has also affected the community's livelihood as many depend on subsistence farming and vending to make a living. For close to a month, Sebele, who normally sells her vegetables in Makwe Business Centre, the adjacent rural settlement on the 'mainland', has been unable to make a living. "The flooding of these rivers has really disabled us because we can't do anything; we can't work and our children cannot go to school," she says. "Last year we could not harvest much because there was a drought, but now we have too much water .... We could not eat because there was no rain, but now we've lost a lot because of these rains. I can't earn anything like this." READ MORE: Zimbabwe's dams swell up as the rainy season ends The local authorities routinely caution against crossing flooded rivers, but the district administrator, Judge Dube, says little can be done to stop people from taking the risk. While efforts to deliver more food and medical supplies are underway, Dube says plans are moving slowly as the emergency services, the Civil Protection Unit (CPU), are still to conduct a full assessment of Sibhula. A more lasting solution, he points out, may lay in the building of temporary bridges. "We expect the military will be deployed so they can start putting up temporary bridges, but we don't know when that will be because the resources are still being mobilised," he says. Across Zimbabwe more than 70 bridges have been damaged by floods and in some areas, pockets of people have been marooned, cut off by overflowing rivers. Thus far, more than 250 people have died during this rainy season and thousands more have been left homeless . Last month, the government declared the floods a national disaster. It is seeking donor assistance in raising close to $200m to repair the destroyed infrastructure, including roads and bridges, but has so far only raised $35m of the required amount. Siphiwenkosi Ndlovu, 20, Musa Ndlovu, 97 and Sehelo Msebele, 35 (left to right), wait to journey back across the river with their sacks of ground maize meal [Tendai Marima/Al Jazeera] 'We were not ready' Although the government is working in partnership with local and international humanitarian agencies to mobilise a flood response, the United Nations has called for more to be done as "huge gaps remain" in providing lifesaving assistance to those affected. We had two previous years of drought, but given the changing weather patterns we were expecting floods this year so we were a little prepared, but we didn't know where they would be or the level of destruction that would come with it Bishow Parajuli, UN Resident Coordinator UN Resident Coordinator, Bishow Parajuli, told Al Jazeera that there has been a positive response from international donors, such as the African Development Bank, which is currently conducting an assessment of the damaged infrastructure. Other partners such as the United States, Britain, Japan and China have promised to scale up their response, he says, but emergency funding is limited. "We had two previous years of drought, but given the changing weather patterns we were expecting floods this year so we were a little prepared, but we didn't know where they would be or the level of destruction that would come with it," Parajuli explains. "We are appealing for more support and we've received a promising response, but we are also aware there are limited emergency resources and on a global scale there are serious situations in other countries as well such as South Sudan, Yemen and Nigeria where there's famine in some places." Parajuli adds that despite the promise of a good harvest next month, the UN agency, the World Food Programme (WFP), would continue to provide food aid so people would not "finish their food too quickly". Last year, a devastating drought left up to four million people in need of assistance, according to the WFP, but this season's heavy rainfall has meant that in some areas crops have been washed away or are waterlogged. 'I don't know where to begin' In Sipepa, a hamlet in Tsholotsho District in the country's far west, the flooding of the Gwaai River, caused by the downgraded Cyclone Dineo, destroyed crops, livestock and displaced hundreds of people. Gladys Ngwenya, 70, lost her entire crop, livestock and furniture to the floods. She is currently living in the Sipepa Flood Victims Camp, which was set up by government district administrators with the support of international aid agencies in the grounds of Sipepa Rural Hospital to accommodate up to 900 people. She says she is thankful that she and her two grandchildren were airlifted to safety by the airforce, but she still worries about starting over once the government relocates them to a new area. "We are given food to eat here, and they [emergency officials] have said they will help us when we leave, but I don't know how; right now we have nothing. All my chickens and the maize I'd planted were taken by the water and now I don't even know where to begin," she says. Andrew Gabela, the camp co-ordinator, explains that although Tsholotsho is generally a flood-prone district, the authorities were not prepared for the storm. READ MORE: Zimbabwe floods killed 246, made thousands homeless But the situation is now under control, he says, and the district authorities are making plans to eventually relocate people to a safer, less flood-prone area. "We were overwhelmed when this happened, we were not ready at all. We hadn't expected so much damage. But with the help of donors, we've started making plans to relocate them," Gabela says. "But for this period these people will be here until their new homes have been built. "They will need something to start over, but we'll cross that bridge later, it's one among many challenges we're trying to deal with." At the camp, Ngwenya shares a large tent with dozens of other women and children. Although NGOs have been quick in their response, the communal site lacks adequate sanitation facilities, blankets and sanitary supplies for women. For now, the villagers live in uncertainty about what the future holds. Much like the country itself, they can only hope that they will be able to rebuild their lives after losing so much.

But the effects of climate change on its landscape are now as visible as selfie sticks in downtown Reykjavik. It's expected that more than two million tourists will visit the country of 340,000 this year. Many of these visitors will pay hundreds of dollars just to experience a brief period walking on a glacier. Ice sheets cover roughly 10 percent of the island, and on most days, guided tours can be found snaking up and down their surface. It's no secret, however, that glaciers around the world are retreating, and Iceland's most popular ones are melting so fast it's creating problems for the guiding companies. In some areas, it's even becoming more dangerous for tourists. A few hours east of Reykjavik is Solheimajokull, a glacial tongue that sprouts off the Myrdalsjokull ice cap in the country's south. It's losing 100 metres of length a year, releasing millions of cubic metres of water in the process. In the past five years, the local guide companies have been forced to move their car park after meltwater formed a large lagoon. The water has also restricted their access on to the glacier. WATCH: AJEats - Reykjavik - Iceland's recipe for survival Melt rates 'through the roof' Dieter Van Holder has spent three years working as a glacier and trekking leader for the Icelandic Mountain Guides. He's watched the lagoon grow at an exponential rate. We have to constantly reinvent ourselves all the time. Dieter Van Holder, glacier guide "Last year we lost close to 20m of altitude in surface ice," he says. "This has been going on for several years, but since 2010 the melt rates have gone through the roof. "We have to constantly reinvent ourselves all the time. We have a lot more work getting on to the ice and maintaining a trail. Personally, I'm starting to fear we're going to lose the front of the glacier to the lagoon. "This is quite dramatic, not just for us, but for the many companies operating here." Groups of tourists on guided trips venture up the front of Solheimajokull glacier. Layers of black ash from the eruption of Katla volcano in 1918 are exposed as the ice melts away [Alexander Lerche/Al Jazeera] WATCH: Climate SOS - Iceland's new carbon capture storage Getting on a glacier is not as simple as walking straight on to the ice. Glaciers are dynamic and behave like a thick, slowly moving viscous fluid. As they shift, their surface undulates and fractures, forcing guides to find new routes - every few days for smaller paths, every week or so for larger ones - where hundreds of people can safely pass with ease. But finding such a path can be difficult, and with climate change speeding up melt rates, maintaining it for daily use is tiring work. "I'm managing a couple of guides today," Van Holder says. "My main objective is to free up enough of them to go chopping on the ice so we have a route that's usable. "We cut into the ice to make a path of stairs, rather than people scrambling and falling over trying to get over uneven parts." He says the stairs are usually cut into the front of the glacier so people can get on to the ice. But it's getting harder to do that. "We used to just walk on to it from the front, but because the lagoon has been growing so fast, we've been pushed into this one corner which is the gnarliest bit of the glacier." Ice caves form inside glaciers, giving visitors a unique perspective of Falljokull's inner structure. Guides say the ice caves never survive the summer months [Alexander Lerche/Al Jazeera] READ MORE: Hungry for whale - Tourists boost Iceland's whaling industry Dangers for tourists: Falling boulders The guides used to lead tourists along the side, but big rocks have been falling there recently, making the route too dangerous to use, Van Holder says. "If you look up the slope, there are massive boulders embedded in ice that's still clinging to the walls. As it melts away, the boulders just drop out and fall to the floor," he says, gesturing with his arms to show how huge they are. But the tourists don't notice them, Van Holder adds. "They just see rocks on the ground and think it's OK to walk around them." Moments later, he dashes to the edge of the glacier. Two American tourists are posing for pictures, unaware that 50 metres above their heads are boulders the size of small cars. "This is the closest glacier to Reykjavik," says Van Holder, catching his breath, after telling the tourists to move away. Although the guides have roped off dangerous areas and put up signs, tourists often ignore them. "For everyone taking a day tour to go on a glacier, most of them come here, so this is a milking cow for many companies. "When the access here goes, I don't know what most of them will do. Right now a lot of companies are relying on us and [tour operator] Arctic Adventures to keep it accessible." The planned routes are essential in keeping tourists away from loose ice and hidden crevasses. They require almost daily maintenance, as what the tour groups don't wear down the sun is quickly melting away, and Solheimajokull has been shrinking since the 1990s. Glaciologists estimate Iceland's glaciers have been losing about 10km3 of ice every year since 1995. A tour group begin their ascent on to Falljokull glacier by following a route chopped into the ice by the guides. The glacier has been losing 35 metres in length every year since 2005 [Alexander Lerche/Al Jazeera] IN PICTURES: Climate change in pictures A glacier 'changing every few days' Guides who have been away from the glacier for a few days say they are always shocked by just how much has disappeared when they return. "Pretty soon, we're going to need to find new places to take the tours on trips," Van Holder says. "Some time this year or next, I would almost be tempted to put my money on it being inaccessible." Two hours drive east is Falljokull, a glaciar tongue on the southwest corner of Vatnajokull, Iceland's largest ice sheet, and the second biggest in Europe. Guides work to build a new bridge across a river draining from Falljokull glacier ahead of the summer season when meltwater run-off increases [Alexander Lerche/Al Jazeera] Falljokull is hugely popular with tourists venturing beyond the Golden Circle, a popular tourist route, but worryingly, all its glaciers are shrinking. From where 4x4 buses drop off tour groups, it's a 30-minute walk across glacial rivers, unsorted debris, and piles of volcanic ash to the edge of the ice. The water that you see running down off the top acts like a hot knife through butter. Thomas Gruber, Glacier Guides Halfway, a Nissan Pathfinder is parked just above a recently formed stream. Two guides are hastily building a makeshift bridge over the muddy water. There is no way to reach the glacier without crossing. "Some of our guides are building new bridges," says Thomas Gruber of Glacier Guides. "In the last heavy run-off the old ones were washed away. We have to build them in anticipation of the increased melt run-off in summer. "This glacier is now in full retreat and we're losing about 14cm of ice a day. Right now it's changing every few days. It's quite amazing how much goes in a short period of time." Scientists have measured the rate of ice change on Falljokull since 1932. The British Geological Survey and the Icelandic Meteorological Office found that since 2005, it has been losing more than 35 metres a year as a result of a decade of unusually warm summers. The glacier's melting ice only contributes to its own erosion, making it harder to explore its hidden features. "The water that you see running down off the top acts like a hot knife through butter," Thomas adds. "It cuts its way into the ice, creating more cracks where water can flow and continue melting away on the inside. "This also has an effect on the ice caves and can flood them with water, making them inaccessible to tours until it drains away. The part of the glacier we are standing on right now will be gone in four to six years," he says. "If anyone has any job offers, that would be great," he jokes. "It's a bit doom and gloom thinking ahead." Guide leader Dieter Van Holder points to a canyon which Solheimajokull extended beyond just a few years ago. The glacier tongue is retreating by 100 metres a year, releasing millions of cubic metres of water in the process [Alexander Lerche/Al Jazeera] READ MORE: Bangladesh's water crisis - A story of gender Tourism boom When the Eyjafjallajokull volcano erupted in 2010, large areas of the glaciers were covered in a thick blanket of black ash. That year, melt rates accelerated well above average, in turn speeding the growth of the lagoons. Despite the eruption, it was Iceland's tourism sector that really exploded. Local patrons of pubs will tell you how the prolonged volcanic eruption actually helped to promote Iceland and attracted visitors to its otherworldly landscape. Many locals complain about the sheer number of tourists. Even so, a sixth of Iceland's jobs are now in the tourism industry. Every year, tourists from all over the world bring in billions of dollars in revenue, and have helped to grow its economy to become 10 percent larger than before the crash. A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a group of 35 mostly rich countries, states that 80 percent of tourists visit for the country's unique " Icelandic nature ". But nothing lasts for ever, and Icelanders understand this all too well. Like their economy, they know they will have to adapt to a changing climate. And as the joke goes: someone should buy a boat. Two glacioloigsts taking temperature readings stand at the edge of the Fjallsarlon glacial lagoon. Large icebergs breaking off from the tongue float to the edge of the lagoon and eventually drift out into the sea [Alexander Lerche/Al Jazeera] Boats instead of hikes Bjorn Hroarsson, a geologist and founder of the Extreme Iceland tour company, already has plans in the works. He started running tours in 1990 and has been forced to make hard decisions in the past. Now he wants to take advantage of the changing conditions and improve tourist safety by dropping the hiking part of the trips in favour of ferrying people over the water. "The Solheimajokull glacier lagoon is giving us difficulties," he says. "It's a longer and longer distance from the car park every year, so a longer hike. The solution will be a boat over the lagoon." He says they plan to start transferring people to the glacier by boat next summer. "It'll be much more easy and safe, and take much less time than the current hike." It's not entirely a new practice; Bjorn says they've successfully used boats in the past. Two guides construct a new bridge across a meltwater river near the Falljokull glacier. As the melt rate changes through the summer months, run-off increases, often changing a river's path [Alexander Lerche/Al Jazeera] But the retreating ice could still cause more problems in the future. The glacier must still be suitable for planning routes on, and that's a factor no tour company can guarantee. "We were operating day glacier hiking tours from Reykjavik on the Hvítarvatn glacier lake," he adds. "We used boats on the lake to transfer our guests to the glacier." But the glacier got shorter and more steep and less safe every year, until they were forced to stop the tours altogether three years ago, Hroarsson says. A tourist struggles to scramble down a route near the base of the Solheimajokull glacier. Guides say the glacier is losing 20 metres of ice in altitude every year and fear the glacier will be inaccessible within two years [Alexander Lerche/Al Jazeera] The glaciers won't disappear, yet Iceland's tourism industry continues to grow strong, and seeks to mitigate the problems that climate change is causing to its landscape. As tour guides spend their days managing routes, the companies are working to adapt for a warming climate with less access to the glaciers. In Reykjavik there are talks of kayak tours, and even discussions about making helicopter drop-offs more commonplace. Both options still present their own logistical and financial constraints. Another issue of concern is the recovery and increased strength of the Icelandic krona since the financial crash, which has led to Iceland becoming one of Europe's most expensive countries to visit, in turn making paid tours less affordable. But away from the visitor hot spots, the ice sheets are still vast, and Iceland can take solace in knowing it will have glaciers safe for tourists to walk on for some time yet. "At least no problem at all - for the next few hundred years," Bjorn says.

Calls for the government to address the root causes of the Rohingya's plight have been ignored, writes Baulk [AP] Correction, August 05, 2015: An earlier version of this article stated that The World Food Programme confirmed that food rations to IDPs are to be cut by up to 20 percent, however, the WFP Myanmar office has decided to hold off on ration cuts until after the November harvest. This year's monsoon rains have been some of the worst to hit Myanmar in decades, leaving dozens dead and thousands displaced across the country. As the scale of damage has become clearer, a sombre inevitability has pervaded the coverage of the devastation left by Cyclone Komen. Yet the hardship faced by many in severely affected areas - particularly northern Kachin and Shan states, and western Rakhine State - is not primarily a result of the heavens. Decades of persecution by the Myanmar government, which continues unabated today, is the chief driver of suffering in ethnic minority regions. Following the collapse of a 17-year ceasefire in 2011, communities in both Kachin and northern Shan states have seen a dramatic escalation in hostilities between several ethnic armed organisations (EAOs) and the Myanmar army, or Tatmadaw. Human rights violations have followed on the heels of conflict. Attacks on civilians, destruction of homes and farm fields, sexual violence, torture, and restrictions on movement have been regularly reported from across these areas. Human rights abuses Human rights abuses - and fears of being caught in the crossfire - have displaced 100,000 people in Kachin State and thousands more in Shan State. Given the instability and destruction in these areas, the monsoon rains often carry misery and death to communities living there.

Some commentators have argued that the scale of abuses faced by the Rohingya amounts to ethnic cleansing . Violent attacks on Rohingya communities and severe discrimination have caused an estimated 100,000 to flee Myanmar since 2012, and left around 140,000 languishing in squalid internally displaced persons' (IDP) camps. The growth of extreme nationalist groups targeting the Rohingya has been abetted by the government, which has done little to rein in the hate speech and violence that has characterised the anti-Muslim movement. Calls for the government to address the root causes of the Rohingya's plight have been ignored, and their exposure to the devastation wrought by yearly monsoon rains has only heightened as a result. Further deterioration Worryingly, the situation faced by these populations looks set to deteriorate further. Earlier in July, The World Food Programme (WFP) confirmed that food rations to IDPs are to be cut by up to 20 percent, however, the WFP Myanmar office has decided to hold off on ration cuts until after the November harvest. Increasingly, the burden to protect populations in Kachin, Shan, and Rakhine states is falling on grassroots groups. "Aid to remote IDP camps in Kachin is overseen by local groups, not big international bodies," said Seng Zin, general secretary of the Kachin Women's Association Thailand (KWAT) . "The government is not interested in IDPs. It's the smaller organisations that take responsibility for these communities. But the situation is getting harder every day." With the spotlight increasingly focused on Naypyitaw, the government has found itself under pressure to meet its obligations under international humanitarian law. In July, the government ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) - reaffirming its commitment to safeguard the right to adequate food, housing, education, and means of subsistence. Denying assistance Yet, as the government was signing on the dotted line, Tatmadaw troops were denying humanitarian assistance to civilians displaced by fighting in Kachin state, and the flood waters in Rakhine State's many IDP camps were swelling. For the government of Myanmar, the ratification of these standards seems to be more of a branding exercise than a meaningful pledge to safeguard people's welfare. There is nothing inevitable in the death and displacement reported over the last week - they are contingent on decisions made by the government, and they can be stopped. Nevertheless, the increased level of scrutiny the government has been willing to face does provide the opportunity for groups to demand accountability for ongoing abuses. Later this year, the Myanmar government will undergo its Universal Periodic Review (UPR) - a United Nations mechanism which serves as a regular marker of a country's progress in meeting internationally accepted human rights standards. Dozens of national and international civil society organisations have submitted reports to the UPR, highlighting ongoing human rights abuses across the country. The reports are unequivocal: displacement, state-sponsored violence and the denial of basic services in ethnic states are central to the vulnerability faced by these populations. Deaths can be stopped There is nothing inevitable in the death and displacement reported over the last week - they are contingent on decisions made by the government, and they can be stopped. There are those who point to the more amenable attitude of the Myanmar government in recent years, arguing that this suggests a real desire to improve human rights in the country. RELATED: Myanmar's military: Judge, jury, executioner But giving credit for the real progress made should not detract from the government's continued failures, which disproportionately affect the country's most marginalised people. The government's refusal to implement core human rights treaties amplifies the devastation at-risk communities face when the rainy season starts. Unless the Myanmar government takes real, concrete steps to address the humanitarian situation in the country, and its own human rights record, the monsoon seasons will continue to be a harbinger of disaster for the country's most vulnerable populations.

US Secretary of State John Kerry appears on television screens during the final conference at the COP21 [AP] Countries taking part in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change summit in Paris, faced with the possibility of total failure, were elated to reach any kind of agreement. As politicians will do, they convinced themselves and as many people as possible in their home nations that the accord signed by 195 countries was an amazing breakthrough document. Such enthusiasm was extremely premature. The agreement that was whittled down to 31 pages over 12 days of laborious negotiations is jam-packed with lofty language and idealistic goals. However, it is totally lacking in any legally binding mechanism to hold governments or corporations to emission quotas that will stop global warming from reaching devastatingly high levels. The greatest challenge the world faces is to get off fossil fuels and, if possible, to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But author and activist Naomi Klein said the promises made by governments as part of the agreement were disastrously weak .

PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY "They don't lead us to 1.5 degrees Celsius or 2 degrees. They lead us to warming of 3 to 4 degrees Celsius, which is beyond catastrophic." Government performances The only check on government performances will be audits carried out every five years. And how will governments be kept honest? Officials claimed that countries that miss their targets could be shamed into doing better. If the Paris summit had a theme, it could be: Rich countries fail to do their part because of an economic system that puts the interests of fossil fuel corporations above those of the people. READ MORE: A final warning on climate change However, the overall pressure to reduce and eventually keep most fossil fuels in the ground was a clear message coming out of Paris. Over the long term polluting corporations will be forced to change dramatically and many will disappear. For now fossil-fuel corporations and multinationals are so powerful they dictate to wealthy countries, even the United States. For now fossil-fuel corporations and multinationals are so powerful that they dictate to wealthy countries , even the United States. When it comes to huge decisions involving the economy, or international trade deals, or processes such as COP21 that affect their business, fossil fuel companies are very powerful and skilled at getting their way. Corporations were involved in just about every aspect of COP21, including helping to pay for the summit. Meanwhile, a few select non-governmental organisations were permitted only to look over the draft of the agreement at the end of each day. Organisers kept thousands of protesters away from the delegates . Largely because of the power corporations wield, the COP21 agreement includes mostly business-friendly market place solutions. None of the words "fossil fuels", "oil" or "coal" appears in the agreement. Carbon markets, which allow some companies to make huge profits but are slow to reduce emissions, were looked upon favourably. Because no action was taken against fracking , the practice, which produces highly damaging methane gas, will increase. French foreign minister and president of the COP21 Laurent Fabius applauds while UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and French President Francois Hollande applaud after the final conference of the COP21 [AP] Large profits Financial institutions are already making large profits from financing many activities related to global warming. The most common funding is for clean energy solutions, underwriting green bonds and structuring catastrophe-linked securities to help clients to manage climate change risks. Trillions of dollars are available for climate and renewable energy projects. The US bank Goldman Sachs created an environmental funding framework in 2005 and has allocated $150bn to finance clean energy projects by 2025. In what environmentalists see as a very risky assumption, the COP21 document counts on corporations investing billions of dollars to create future technologies capable of removing huge quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere many decades from now. If the dream technology does not materialise, keeping emissions to reasonable levels will be pretty much impossible . READ MORE: Climate activism - A change in approach? Because of the rapidly increasing concerns over global warming, investors are concerned that fossil fuels will eventually become so unpopular that they will lose their value. In September, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said investors need to be concerned about the potential for huge losses from a sudden shift in regulations designed to curb global warming and the use of fossil fuels. Trillions of dollars are invested in all forms of non-renewable energy. Coal is the worst carbon dioxide emitter. It's already under serious attack, particularly in developed countries. Market values of coal producing corporations are falling. China and India, the two largest users, are facing pressure to dump coal. The value of oil has fallen tremendously around the world because of OPEC's decision to flood markets. The low valuations are making it possible for renewables, particularly solar, to compete for investment dollars. More than half of global investment in new electricity generation is in renewables. OPINION: Climate change and China: The indispensable nation Even in the oil-rich Gulf states , solar energy "presents a significant opportunity to make savings, reduce fuel cost risks, achieve climate ambitions and, at the same time, keep more oil and gas available for export". While unfettered capitalism and the marketplace have been the nemesis of a clean environment for some 50 years, now some aspects of the marketplace will help to save the environment - but in its own way and in its own time.

A girl stands in a flooded area after hurricane Irma in Fort Liberte, Haiti September 8, 2017 [Andres Martinez Casares/Reuters] The hurricane season here in Haiti runs from June to November. There are still two months to go. We keep checking the latest data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as it predicts more hurricanes. We've already had Harvey , Irma, Jose, Katia and Lee, now Maria. The World Meteorological Association has a list of names ready for those that could come next: Nate, Ophelia, Philippe, Rina, Sean, Tammy, Vince, Whitney. And so we prepare.

In October last year, Category 5 Matthew hit more than a million people in south-east Haiti. This year, another Category 5 - Irma - threatened northern Haiti after having all but destroyed some of the smaller Caribbean islands. But Irma skirted Haiti and, as if reminding itself of its destructive sense of purpose, hit Cuba instead, devastating housing, infrastructure and agriculture, and rebounding into Florida. In Haiti's northern municipalities, Oxfam, Unicef and the local health ministry run a "fire-fighter" cholera elimination programme. Cholera is like wildfire. Oxfam teams work to isolate the case, set up a sanitary cordon, and then seek the source and treat the water. "The programme is finally achieving success," says Laurence Desvignes, who coordinates the programme. "Zero cases here since July, and now just ten cases a week in the north, down from hundreds each week at the peak of the epidemic." READ MORE: Hurricane Maria leaves at least 15 dead in Dominica There was a lot of cholera in the United States back in the 1800s. People become stricken with diarrhoea and dehydration. It's a killer. Modern water and sewage treatments can stop it. The solution is not a mystery but it is incredibly difficult in Haiti because it has such poor water and sanitation. "If the hurricane had hit us hard it could have ignited another epidemic very easily," says Desvignes. One immediate task is to spend more on getting people prepared. That means developing expert local humanitarian capacity, leading to better contingency planning, risk mitigation, education and awareness. Climate change is changing the game for us. Warmer Atlantic waters are super-charging these storms, making them more frequent and intense. Caribbean island nations are terribly exposed on the front line. Many people turn to religion, "the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions …the opium of the people". That might help give comfort but isn't going to fix the problem. Climate change needs us to rethink, globally and locally. We need a new direction for public and private investment. One immediate task is to spend more on getting people prepared. That means developing expert local humanitarian capacity, leading to better contingency planning, risk mitigation, education and awareness. This must involve vulnerable communities. We already have policies and often even laws. But there's a big gap in acting upon them - and a stunning absence of political will. Everywhere. The Inter-American Development Bank's new Risk Management Index measures countries' capacity to reduce risk, recover from disaster and provide financial protection. Every country measured in this region has failed to reach even a satisfactory level. The international community currently spends only 1 percent of aid on disaster preparedness. Since 2000, more than a million people have died in disasters. Recovering from them is costing us between $250bn and $300bn a year. The UNDP says that e ach dollar invested in disaster preparedness saves seven dollars in recovery. We know what to do. We just need to do more. WATCH: What's behind world's recent extreme weather events? (25:16) But what really causes the "disaster" is not wind or rain … its economic inequality. Haiti is less than 500 miles from Florida but may as well be on another planet. Haiti's once prosperous rice production, its principal economic activity, has long-since collapsed after tariffs were stripped from 50 percent to 3 percent and subsidised US rice was able to be dumped onto its market. There are few jobs in Haiti, no social protection, safety nets or insurances. Haiti's social and economic situation is one of the hemisphere's biggest collective failures. This is why we end up fire-fighting cholera after a hurricane in Haiti. This week - even as Hurricane Irma spared it - violence erupted on the streets of Port au Prince. Police sprayed tear gas at people. The spark was a new budget, approved by parliament on the eve of Irma, that voted in a 74 percent increase in salaries and benefits to members of parliament alongside new taxes on consumption that will hit the pockets of the poorest. That is a preparatory measure to guarantee a disaster. Simon Ticehurst is the Oxfam Regional Director for Latin America and Caribbean .

A powerful typhoon has slammed into Japan , killing at least four people. Those who died included a man hit by falling scaffolding, a fisherman tending to his boat, and a young woman whose car was washed away by floodwaters. The storm also forced the cancellation of approximately 350 flights and caused widespread disruption to train services. Typhoon Lan rapidly weakened as it crossed the southeast of the country, but it still produced torrential rain. Shionomisaki, on the southernmost tip of Honshu, reported a staggering 321 millimetres of rain. As the rain poured down, some 80,000 people in Koriyama were ordered to evacuate their homes. There were concerns that the city, 200 kilometres north of Tokyo, could experience widespread flooding as a river neared the top of its banks, broadcaster NHK said - but fortunately by the afternoon, water levels were starting to fall. Elsewhere in western Japan, homeowners were not so lucky, and several hundred homes were inundated. The storm also generated huge waves, which tossed fishing boats onto the shore. A container ship was stranded after being swept onto a harbour wall, but all 19 crew members escaped injury. The capital, Tokyo, was largely spared the worst of the storm but was still pelted by torrential rain and strong winds. At its peak, Typhoon Lan was a powerful storm with sustained winds of 250 kilometres per hour, the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane. It weakened to the equivalent of a Category 2 storm before landfall. With gale force winds (at least 62 km/h) extending to approximately 2,220 kilometres, it was one of the largest tropical cyclones on record. Typhoon Lan has now cleared the east coast of Honshu and is disintegrating in the Western Pacific. However, another storm has recently developed to the east of the Philippines. That storm is expected to strengthen rapidly and follow a similar track to Typhoon Lan. This could potentially bring another powerful typhoon to the shores of southeast Honshu in approximately one week's time. SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Weather Japan Asia Pacific
The amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in our world is likely to top 410 parts per million (ppm) this year. The CO2 measured at the Mauna Loa Baseline Atmospheric Observatory in Hawaii hit 405.1 ppm in 2016 - an increase of 3 ppm over the previous year, marking five consecutive years of an unprecedented rate of growth, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. CO2 is the most prominent, abundant and measurable greenhouse gas, responsible for keeping the world warm enough for life. It is also capable of making the atmosphere too warm when its concentration becomes too great. The increased burning of fossil fuels since the industrial revolution has driven up the amount of CO2 held in the atmosphere to unprecedented levels. However, a new NASA study provides space-based evidence that Earth's tropical regions were the source of the largest annual increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration in at least 2,000 years. The 2015-16 El Nino - one of the largest on record - caused abnormal, but expected, heat and drought in the tropical regions of South America, Africa and Indonesia. "These three tropical regions released 2.5 gigatons more carbon into the atmosphere than they did in 2011," said Junjie Liu of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, who is the lead author of the study. Warming trend NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 mission, (OCO-2), launched in 2014, gathers global measurements of atmospheric CO2 with the resolution, precision and coverage needed to map the movement and concentration of CO2 around the world. OCO-2 recorded atmospheric CO2 increases that were 50 percent larger than the preceding non-El Nino years and equate to about 3 ppm or 6.3 gigatons of carbon. This sudden increase occurred even though emissions from human activities in 2015-16 were estimated to have remained roughly the same as they were before the El Nino event. OCO-2 Deputy Project Scientist Annmarie Eldering of JPL said: "The team's findings imply that if future climate brings more or longer droughts, as the last El Nino did, more carbon dioxide may remain in the atmosphere, leading to a tendency to further warm Earth." The reasoning behind this argument is the altered natural processes that take place in these normally carbon-sink areas of the earth's green clothing: In tropical South America, severe drought (driest in 30 years) and higher-than-normal temperatures stressed vegetation and reduced photosynthesis. Thus, vegetation absorbed less carbon from the atmosphere, and the effect was to increase the net amount of carbon released into the atmosphere. Rainfall in tropical Africa was at normal levels, but ecosystems endured higher-than-normal temperatures. Dead trees and plants decomposed more, resulting in more carbon being released into the atmosphere. Tropical Asia had the second-driest year in the past 30 years. Its increased carbon release, primarily from Indonesia, was mainly due to increased peat and forest fires, also measured by satellite instruments. On average, Earth's land and ocean absorb about half the CO2 released by humans, with the other half leading to increasing atmospheric concentrations. There is natural variation, and in some years the absorption is as little as 20 percent of human emissions, while in other years as much as 80 percent can be scrubbed from the atmosphere. Deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels remain humanity's biggest contributions to CO2 increase, and therefore climate change. It is notable though that each El Nino event makes another irregular but significant injection. SOURCE: Al Jazeera Weather Climate SOS Asia Africa NASA
Nearly 300mm of rain fell on October 2 in Bundaberg on the Queensland coast of Australia . Tornadic activity was seen, and there was significant damage. That storm dropped five times the month's average rainfall in one day. Now it's happening again. Bundaberg has recorded rain gauge amounts of more than 250mm in the last three days. Farmers in Queensland say they've lost millions of dollars worth of crops in the second heavy rainfall event in as many weeks. This time the flooding is more widespread. David de Paoli, a c hilli and avocado grower, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that he suffered more than a million dollars in losses from the most recent storm. "This is it, the last time we had that 350mm it was quick and fast and furious it caused structural damage and soil erosion, but this one's costing us our crop," he said. Meteorologist Ben Domensino wrote on weatherzone.com.au that "it has been a remarkably wet October in parts of Queensland, with some areas receiving seven months worth of rain during the last two and a half weeks". He added that "a series of rain-bearing systems have targeted Queensland since the beginning of October, the latest of which has been affecting the state's central and eastern districts since the weekend". The main rain risk is now over. Forecast models show no more than about 30mm of rain over the next three days in the Bundaberg area. SOURCE: Al Jazeera Weather Australia
A fine spell of autumn weather is in store for many parts of Europe in the next week as a "blocking high" takes charge. Also known as an "omega block", this large-scale atmospheric feature tends to be slow-moving, meaning that settled weather conditions are likely to persist for a week or more. Not surprisingly, the best of the weather will be across southern Europe. For example, Madrid, Spain will see temperatures of at least 23C until next weekend at least. This compares with an October average maximum temperature of 19C. Rome, Italy is also expected to record temperatures 2 to 4C above the October average of 22C. Further north, Vienna, Austria is expected to be around 5C warmer than average. In Berlin, Germany temperatures will be up to 11C above the 13C average maximum. The downside of an omega block is often that, with longer nights and therefore, more nocturnal cooling, there could be issues with fog and low cloud. On the western periphery of the block, there is another feature which is causing great interest: Hurricane Ophelia. Ophelia is a Category 1 hurricane , lying almost 1,200km to the southwest of the Azores. In the coming days, Ophelia is expected to retain its strength as it gathers pace, passing just to the east of the Azores around 00:00 GMT on Sunday. Even though the islands will not take a direct hit from Ophelia, they will be battered by strong winds and heavy rain. Interestingly, according to weather.com, only 12 hurricanes have passed within 300km of the Azores in records that date back to 1851. This, in turn, poses real problems for weather forecasters and their computer forecasts. With little in the way of historical precedence to rely on, it is very much a case of "unknown territory" in trying to forecast the developments of such a storm. Current forecasts take Ophelia over western Ireland on Monday and this is sure to bring a period of very stormy weather. But the forecast track remains uncertain, and there will be added interest in this storm, as it will coincide with the 30th anniversary of what is known in the UK as The Great Storm, which caught everyone, including the forecasters, by surprise. It strengthened explosively before striking southern England, causing widespread damage, several deaths and uprooting hundreds of thousands of trees. The very landscape of England was forever changed by this storm. Hopefully, Ophelia will make less of an impact, but only time will tell. SOURCE: Al Jazeera and news agencies Weather Europe
RenderPagesVideo('5613990297001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); As ex-Hurricane Ophelia battered Ireland and the UK, it also turned the sky a strange colour. Thick sand, dust and smoke in the atmosphere turned the sky an ominous shade of yellow and transformed the sun into a deep orange colour. People described the midday sky as looking more like sunset and reported street lights coming on automatically in the middle of the day. Some of the sand and dust had been transported thousands of kilometres from Africa's Sahara Desert. Carried on the winds of Ophelia, the dust was high in the atmosphere, so at street-level, the air was clear and safe to breathe. The air also contained a significant amount of smoke from deadly wildfires in Spain and Portugal. The flames had been fanned by the storm, becoming treacherous over the past few days. As Ophelia moves across Scandinavia, a trailing leg of cloud and rain will bring useful wet weather to the Iberian Peninsula. This will hopefully help to dampen the flames over the next few days.

The political division of Ireland may be a very clear one, but both the southern Republic and Northern Ireland will be united in facing the force of Hurricane Ophelia. Technically, Ophelia will no longer be a hurricane when it strikes Ireland on Monday. It will have been downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone. That distinction may be lost on those across the island who could be facing sustained wind speeds of 150km/h and gusts of 200km/h. On Sunday, Ophelia was still a Category 3 hurricane , on the five-point Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained winds of 185km/h. After drifting around the central Atlantic over a period of days, Ophelia has now been incorporated into the "conveyor belt" of air ahead of a frontal system further to the west. Consequently, Ophelia is accelerating, heading northeast at around 45km/h. It is expected that Ophelia will take on frontal characteristics by the time it reaches Ireland on Monday, but the characteristic tight, circular rotation will be in evidence as it then sweeps across the island. Its arrival will come at a meteorologically significant time, for it will be 30 years to the day since the southern UK was struck by what became known as, The Great Storm. This frontal depression, without the additional contribution of any post-tropical cyclone, formed well to the southwest of the UK before deepening explosively. It produced a drop in pressure, unlike anything seen in living memory. The resulting increase in wind speed was spotted too late to give adequate warning and on the night of the 15 and into the 16 October wind gusts of up to 217km/h caused widespread damage and several fatalities. The storm struck after a mild, wet period across the southern half of the UK. Many trees were still in full leaf. That, and the unusual wind direction for such strong winds (southeasterly rather than southwesterly) resulted in the very landscape of the region being changed forever, as hundreds of thousands of trees were felled by the winds. In turn, those trees toppled thousands of power lines, and power was disrupted for a period of several days. In Ophelia's case, such a scenario is unlikely. The region is familiar with stormy weather , being the first port of call for many Atlantic storms, but structural damage is highly likely across southwestern parts of the Republic. The Irish Met Service has issued "red" warnings for counties Cork Kerry, Clare, Galway and Mayo. The warnings mention sustained winds of 80km/h and gusts of 130km/h, but as mentioned above, uncertainty in the development of the storm in the coming hours means that there is the potential for even worse conditions.

A week ago, Typhoon Lan made landfall on Japan's main island of Honshu and was driven across Tokyo. It was a major typhoon, one of the biggest on record, but was weakening before it reached Japan's capital. Now another tropical cyclone is battering Japan. Saola is neither as large nor as powerful as its predecessor but has been around long enough to gather a lot of moisture and bring a landslide threat through its heavy rain. On Friday, Saola passed over Okinawa. It was still a tropical storm, winds were no more than gale force. Many flights in and out of Okinawa's airport were cancelled and in the city of Naha, 141mm of rain was recorded as Saola passed over. Appearing to follow the Ryukyu archipelago of small Japanese islands, Saolo strengthened to become a typhoon - just barely. Wind strength is the factor that determines when a tropical storm becomes a typhoon, and Saola maintained this status for about 30 hours. The real signature of Saola has been the amount of rain it was capable of dropping. Encountering Kyushu, it dumped an extraordinary 424mm in 24 hours on the cruise port of Aburatsu. This is a dangerous amount of rain to fall on a mountainous island such as Kyushu. Flash flooding and landslides are the usual result. Travelling parallel with the Japanese coast, Saola soon dropped back to tropical storm status and, heading northeast, accelerated from 25 to 50 km/h - a remarkably fast-travelling tropical cyclone. Luckily for Honshu, including Tokyo, this makes the time of exposure to heavy rain much less. It rained in Owase for 44 hours - the rain has always spread a long way in front of Saola - but in contrast to Aburatsu, Owase recorded a mere 136mm. Thirty-six hours of rain in Tokyo has yielded just 87mm. Travelling away at some 50km/h, Saola had no chance of maintaining the characteristics of a tropical cyclone but will bring a spell of heavy rain to Hokkaido and the Kuril Islands on Monday. The Kamchatka Peninsula, then, will likely get a month's worth of rain on Tuesday. SOURCE: Al Jazeera Weather Asia Pacific Japan Tropical Storm
Seasonal rains have brought record-breaking wet weather to parts of Tanzania . The heavy downpours have led to widespread flooding, resulting in major travel disruptions. Meteorologist Hellen Msemo reported that the worst of the flooding had occurred along Tanzania's northern coast. Much of the infrastructure has been damaged, and the main highway to the nation's largest city, Dar es Salaam, has been cut off from the north of the country. The international airport at Dar es Salaam had 174mm of rain on Thursday. This was the heaviest October rainfall since records began in 1918. The October average is 69mm. Many places in the region broke their 24 hour rainfall records. Kibaha had its wettest day in 53 years with 178mm of rain. There have been many accidents and many roads will remain closed for some time. Dozens of homes and businesses have been submerged underwater because of swollen rivers and mudslides.

An unusual tropical storm, Selma, formed recently to the south of the San Salvador coast. Its winds, at worst, are limited to 70km per hour but its rain potential over the country is about 300mm, all within 24 hours. Selma is unusual in forming so far east in the Pacific. The National Hurricane Center noted in its discussion on Friday morning that Selma is only the second tropical storm to form east of longitude 90W on record, that did not come from an Atlantic basin tropical cyclone. The land bridge that joins South and North America is slim enough in places that hurricanes can cross from one side to the other without losing their identity. In the worst case, a hurricane can sit over a country like Nicaragua, being fed by the warm waters on either side. Hurricane Mitch was such an example: the second deadliest hurricane in history, beaten only by The Great Hurricane of 1780, and devastating for both Nicaragua and Honduras. Mitch killed 7,000 people in Honduras , 3,800 in Nicaragua and 240 in El Salvador , mostly by rain-induced landslides. Once again, in late October, all three countries are suffering from the effects of tropical cyclones . These are by no means as powerful but bring threats of a smaller, yet substantial nature. There has been significant rain over the last five days in Nicaragua and Honduras from thunderstorms that have finally formed a recognisable tropical depression. In Tela, on the north coast of Honduras, 399mm has fallen so far. Over the island of Roatan, off the coast of Honduras, 287mm of rain has been collected. The identified tropical depression, 18, has a high chance of becoming a storm, at which point it will be called Philippe. Its forecast track takes it from the northwest Caribbean, towards the Bahamas . Owen Roberts Airport on Grand Cayman has already reported 110mm of rain, from thunderstorms on the eastern side of this depression. Tropical storm warnings, which cover wind strength and heavy rain, are in effect for western Cuba and the northwest Bahamas. SOURCE: Al Jazeera Weather Latin America Cyclone Nicaragua Honduras
This year's very active hurricane season threatens to throw up another spell of damaging weather over the next few days. Nicaragua is currently bracing for the possible formation of a tropical storm as a clutch of storms continues to gather in the western Caribbean. The showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area of low pressure have gradually become more organised recently. The storms have gathered just off Nicaragua's eastern coast, and according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), their proximity to land is likely to limit development, at least for a while. Conditions are expected to be more favourable for the system to become more organised by the weekend as the system gradually moves north across the western side of the Caribbean. The NHC is currently giving a 30 percent chance of the formation of a tropical storm within the next 48 hours. That risk goes up to 40 percent within the next five days. Regardless of any development, heavy rain is likely to cause some disruption over parts of Central America and Cuba over the next few days. Those rains have already begun. The Honduran town of Tela recorded 137mm of rain on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the town of Flores in Guatemala recorded 320mm of rain over a 24-hour period on Wednesday into Thursday. The rains usually ease off at this time of the year, but it was even wetter at the international airport in Guatemala City where they had two months' worth of rain. A whopping 361mm of rain fell in just 24 hours. The October average is 130mm. SOURCE: Al Jazeera Nicaragua Weather Latin America
Much of southern and central Japan is on high alert as Typhoon Lan approaches. The outer bands of the storm have been lashing parts of Kyushu and Honshu for the last two days. The centre of Typhoon Lan, which is locally known as Paolo, is expected to make landfall just to the west of Tokyo, late on Sunday night local time. People voting in Japan's snap election managed to get out to the polling stations before the worst of the winds, but the torrential downpours had already set in. At one stage, Lan was packing winds of around 240 kilometres per hour. At this stage, it was classified as a super typhoon , equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. {articleGUID} It has since weakened, but it does remain a dangerous system capable of causing catastrophic damage. According to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, Typhoon Lan currently has winds nearing 230km/h with gusts touching 280km/h. Further weakening is expected, but at landfall, those winds are still likely to be around 185km/h with much higher gusts. Devastating damage is possible. There will be widespread disruption, particularly since so many people will be affected as the storm passes very close to Tokyo. The Japanese capital has already had 101mm of rain in the 24 hours up to 06:00 GMT on Sunday. That is well over half the average October rainfall figure of 198mm. Rainfall totals have been significantly higher elsewhere. Oshima recorded 204mm of rain. Shionomisak was even wetter, notching up 236mmin the same period. A similar amount is expected over the next 24 hours. The heaviest rain is expected over the higher ground where totals approaching 400 to 500mm of rain are possible. Honshu is likely to receive its heaviest snow of the season so far as the storm sweeps through during Monday. All should be quiet by Tuesday with barely a cloud in the sky.

At least 72 people died in last week's floods, the worst to hit Vietnam in decades [Reuters] Just a week after destructive floods battered Vietnam , the country is now preparing for the arrival of Tropical Storm Khanun. The storm is crossing the Leizhou Peninsula and is currently located around 300 kilometres to the east of Hanoi. Khanun was the 20th typhoon this year, having made landfall in southern China on Monday morning (local time) in Xuwen county in Guangdong province. It has since weakened significantly, and a final warning for the storm is expected to be issued by the end of Monday. The winds may not be a problem, but Khanun is expected to spread heavy rains across southwest China into the north and central areas of Vietnam. Rainfall totals have exceeded 100mm in places as the storm brushed the coast of southern China. Haikou recorded 123mm of rain on Sunday. Meanwhile, Shanwei notched up 135mm in the same 24-hour period. Vietnam's disaster prevention agency said 72 people died in last week's floods. According to the government and state-run Vietnam Television, those floods were the worst in decades. Thousands of homes were submerged. Another 200 houses collapsed, and several towns remain cut off by the floodwaters. The floods also damaged more than 22,000 hectares of rice fields. The torrential rains associated with Tropical Storm Khanun will exacerbate those floods, with the country braced for another spell of widespread disruption across the north over the next few days.

At least 27 people were killed and 22 are missing, according to Vietnam News, after Typhoon Damrey ripped into southern Vietnam. The devastating storm struck on Saturday - a week before the country welcomes world leaders to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. Vietnam is no stranger to cyclones but Accuweather reported this was the strongest in the area for 16 years. Damrey, cyclone number 12 of the year, made landfall near Nha Trang with the equivalent strength of a Category 2 hurricane. Steady winds of 140 kilometres per hour with higher gusts were reported to have sunk as many as 228 vessels - mostly small fishing boats off the coast of Phu Yen Province - and 17 of the people missing were the crew of a cargo ship. More than 36,000 people in the coastal Can Gio district of Ho Chi Min city were evacuated as thousands of houses were damaged and more 600 destroyed. Hundreds of trees and electricity poles were felled, taking the power supply out. Maybe more significant was the destruction of 40,000 hectares of crops. Heavy rain and high tide combined to inundate a number of areas in Ho Chi Min , with many roads in downtown districts under a half-metre of water. But the rain was heavier still to the north of the centre of the typhoon. Hue was flooded with 93mm of rain but that was about the northern limit of the heavy stuff. Quang Ngai seemed to catch most of the downpour - an outstanding 580mm since Damrey's rain started there on Friday. By now mostly disintegrated, Damrey spent Sunday crossing neighbouring Cambodia, dropping at least 100mm of rain along its path to the Gulf of Thailand.

Astana, Kazakhstan - "Astana is created from nothing," they say here. There is certainly some truth to that as it is a city created from scratch on a Central Asian steppe. I am here for the 7th round of talks on ending six years of devastating war in Syria, which are led by three main players: Russia , Iran and Turkey . The Russians and Iranians are backing the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad , and Turkey is backing some of the rebels. Then you have the Syrian government itself, the Syrian opposition, and delegations from the United States and United Nations . However, it has become extremely clear it's the Russians who are in charge of this particular show. While that may come as no surprise to Syrian observers, the depth of their influence certainly surprised me. Speaking to some people at these talks, you get a real sense that the Russians have consolidated politics and military tactics in Syria into something all other parties failed to do. The Russians have either forced or coerced the Syrian regime into remaining quiet and doing, as they say, some analysts say. It's a strategy that certainly seems to be working. Deepening Russia's involvement, its foreign ministry announced on Tuesday that 33 Syrian opposition groups and political parties had been invited to the Russian resort of Sochi for a "Syrian Congress on National Dialogue" on November 18. For its part, the US has stated it wants the Assad regime to have no political role in the future of Syria, but in Astana that was met with scepticism. The Russian special envoy for Syria, Alexander Lavrentyev, told reporters: "The Syrian president made an important statement on the 26th [October] in which he said he would welcome, or to be more accurate, he made it clearer about his thoughts on constitutional amendments, which includes drafting a new constitution and holding parliamentary and presidential elections." Reading between the lines, Russia sees a role for Assad in the future. {articleGUID} When it comes to Syrian opposition figures, the Russians appear to be saying they will get what they're given. The main demand of the opposition is prisoner-hostage exchanges. The Russian envoy Lavrentyev says such moves are a "complicated issue", which suggests no agreement will be reached. The Syrian opposition understands it is in a position of weakness because it is so divided. Opposition consultant Yahya al-Aridi was diplomatic when talking to Al Jazeera. "In a sense we are united because we want a peaceful Syria, but we don't a have format. But the substance is more important than the format," Aridi said. Format is important, however, because it allows Russia to take advantage of Syrian opposition disunity to Moscow's advantage, which has long been a complaint of the disparate groups opposing Assad. Then there is the UN, which is pushing for political change. The Russians are making the right noises about Assad but not any concrete promises about his future. Assad himself is biding his time. Meanwhile on the ground, even in de-escalation zones set up after the Astana talks in September, violence against civilians continues unabated. The International Rescue Committee says Russia, Iran, and Turkey have failed to protect civilians. The three countries are guarantors of the so-called safe zones, and they say any attacks they launch are against legitimate targets, including the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) and Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham . The US role is also somewhat confusing, particularly for the Syrian opposition that eyes Russia's influence with much suspicion. The only thing the Americans seem to be consistent about in their statements is not having Assad in power, which the Russians and Iran are managing quite well. At breakfast I overheard one member of a western delegation ask the location of the Syrian government representatives. "We need to ask the Russians, they are meeting them soon," came the reply. It is a fitting aside. At the talks in Astana, the Russians seem to be at the centre of it all.

Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have been a key US ally in the fight against ISIL in Iraq [Reuters] With the upsurge of sectarian violence and political chaos in the Middle East , one of the region’s most protracted conflicts has been brought to the fore: the Kurdish question. Earlier this month, Masoud Barzani, the president of the Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), announced plans to hold a referendum on independence for the northern Kurdistan region. While a “Yes” vote, which is widely expected to be the result, would not lead to an automatic declaration of independence, it would to give Iraqi Kurds, who make up about 20 percent of the population, more leverage in talks on self-determination with the central government. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5465412556001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5465412556001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > Kurdish government calls referendum on independence PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Politically, the KRG already functions as an independent nation-state with its own parliament, armed forces (known as the Peshmerga ) and foreign policy within a federation with the rest of Iraq . But economically, the KRG is still dependent on the central government as a result of a revenue-sharing system for oil wealth. The regional government also heavily relies on its two main trade partners Turkey and Iran, both of which have come out against the referendum for fear the vote will further embolden their own Kurdish populations. “We think this will represent a terrible mistake,” said the Turkish foreign ministry in a statement . “The maintenance of Iraq’s territorial integrity and political unit is one of the fundamental principles of Turkey’s Iraq policy.” But in a country that is already rife with sectarian violence, the move is likely to strain already fragile relations between the regional capital Erbil and Baghdad, and risks sparking intra-Kurdish clashes that could spill over into neighbouring countries. Baghdad has already rejected the referendum call. “No party can, on its own, decide the fate of Iraq, in isolation from the other parties,” Saad al-Haddithi, Iraqi government spokesman, said earlier this month in a statement. “Iraq is constitutionally a democratic, federal country with full sovereignty...Any measure from any side in Iraq should be based on the constitution.” Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi said in April that while he respected the Kurdish right to vote on independence, he did not think the timing was right for the move. OPINION: Iraqi Kurdistan - Playing the independence game The vote, set for September 25, will take place in the three governorates that make up the autonomous Kurdish region (Erbil, Dohok, and Suleimaniah), as well as other disputed areas that are claimed by both Kurdish Iraq and Baghdad: Makhmour in the north, Sinjar in the northwest and Khanaqin in the east, and most importantly, the oil-rich province of Kirkuk. The city of Kirkuk, which sits atop an estimated three percent of global proven oil reserves, is home to a large mix of religious and ethnics groups, including Kurds, Arabs, Turkmen and Christians, making it the most important disputed area and a constant source of contention. Iraq’s Kurds have likened Kirkuk to their own “Jerusalem”. Last April, attempts to raise the KRG flag on top of public buildings in the city sparked backlash and accusations of “sedition” from the central government. Iraqi Kurds had previously accused Baghdad of manipulating the demographic makeup of the city by forcefully pushing Kurds out and settling in Arab families in their place as part of the “ Arabisation ” policies of Saddam Hussein . In addition to systematic discrimination policies, Hussein led a bloody campaign against Iraqi Kurds, known as the “ Anfal Campaigns ” of 1987 to 1989, during which thousands of villages were reportedly burned and destroyed. Human Rights Watch put the total number of deaths and disappearances during these campaigns between 50,000 and 100,000 people . During the last days of the eight-year war, the Baathist government carried out a chemical attack in the Kurdish town of Halabja , immediately killing up to 5,000 people. Two years after the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, which brought an end to Hussein’s Baathist regime, a new federal constitution was drafted that approved and listed the Kirkuk province as one of the disputed territories whose legal fate would depend on a referendum. Iraqi Kurds have since sought to annex the disputed territories by employing two provisions of the new constitution: Article 140, which mandates the reversal of Hussein’s Arabisation policies; and Article 119, which allows governorates to become or join an existing region by a referendum. The government’s failure to implement the provisions before a December 2007 deadline cast doubt on the viability of KRG’s soft approach and led to renewed mistrust between Erbil and Baghdad. The dispute over the Kirkuk province , aside from the Kurds’ claim to the land, is further hindered by a constitutional ambiguity. The federal constitution stipulates that the management of oil and gas extracted from “present fields” is the responsibility of both the federal and regional governments, and mandates that oil revenues are to be distributed equally across the country. But it fails to stipulate whether the largely untapped oil reserves in KGR territory are considered within the “present fields”. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5417582591001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5417582591001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > Is Washington undermining its alliance with Ankara by aligning with the Kurds in Syria? PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Aided by this legal loophole, the KRG has invited a number of international oil companies (IOCs) to develop its untapped resources and has kept all the revenue for itself, drawing the ire of the central government. Kurdish Peshmerga forces have been key in reversing gains made by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) since it swept across the country in 2014. In doing so, the US-backed Kurdish forces have steadily expanded KRG-controlled territory, unilaterally expanding into “contested areas”, many of which were victim of Saddam Hussein’s “Arabisation” policies. With the battle for Mosul nearing an end , the KRG will be in the position to use its control over vast new swaths of territory in its negotiations with Baghdad. Further complicating matters is the KRG’s rivalry with the Sinjar Resistance Units (YBS), a Yazidi armed group affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that has been waging a bloody battle for greater autonomy in Turkey since 1984. The Peshmerga forces – Ankara’s main allies in Iraq - have repeatedly clashed with the YBS, who in turn have warned the KRG of attempting to assert its control in Sinjar, another disputed area. And as PMU units push further into Sinjar in an effort to clear ISIL from the Iraq-Syria border as part of the ongoing efforts to take Mosul, their collaboration with PKK-allied YBS fighters have prompted fears of Turkish military intervention. In Pictures: Kurds in Iraq ring in the new year Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in early 20th century, the Kurds, a distinct people with their own language and culture, found themselves scattered across four regions: Southeastern Turkey, parts of Iran, northeastern Syria and northern Iraq – areas they regarded as their ancestral homeland ever since. Alarmed by their aspirations for cultural and political autonomy, and in some cases, pursuits for independence, the successive governments of Turkey, Iran, Syria and Iraq have systematically subjugated their Kurdish populations through decades of assimilation, repression and containment policies. In Syria, some 120,000 Syrian Kurds were left without citizenship and thousands of others were forced to flee to other Kurdish regions as a result of a racially motivated census that dates back to 1962. Today, Syrian Kurds, who make up the biggest ethnic minority group in the country with a population of about two million, are displaying similar aspirations for autonomy, although not independence per se, to those of the Kurds in Iraq. Aided by the security vacuum caused by the Syrian civil war, the Kurdish-led Democratic Union Party (PYD) and allied groups declared a form of “federal democratic system” in the northern part of the country, dubbing the territories under its control "Rojava" (or Western Kurdistan). The PYD and its armed wing, the People's Protection Units (YPG) – a key US ally in the fight against ISIS in Syria – have been advocating for a form of democratic federalism in Syria With the war in Syria now well into its sixth year, and with Iraqi Kurds taking a step closer toward independence, Syrian Kurds could reconsider their self-determination aspirations and seek independence, adding a complicated layer to a region already entangled in a complex web of conflicts.

Armed attackers and suicide bombers have targeted two of the most important national symbols of Iran , leaving at least 12 people dead and throwing the country into a state of unease, amid already heightened regional tensions. Wednesday's attack on the national parliament and the shrine of the Islamic Republic's founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini were "unprecedented" actions against state institutions in recent years, and it could reverberate across the Middle East , said Reza Khaasteh, a journalist of the Tehran-based Iran Front Page. "We did not have any similar attack in Iran for a long time," Khaasteh told Al Jazeera. "This one is like those that happened in Europe." READ MORE: Iran and ISIL 'top priority' for Iraq-US relations "If links to foreign sources are found, it can be an escalation," he said. The armed group, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS), said its fighters carried out the attack. All four suspects involved in the parliament siege are dead, and the three others at the Khomeini shrine were killed. Al Jazeera could not independently confirm the claim that they were ISIL fighters. Until the attack on Wednesday, Iran has been fighting against ISIL in Iraq and Syria. However, during Ramadan in 2016, the Iranian government reported that it foiled a major ISIL plot within the country. "There were numerous attempts by ISIL elements to enter Iran for terrorist operations. But all of them have been diffused. This time, we do not know what will happen," Khaasteh said. Following the attack, Iran's Revolutionary Guard vowed "revenge" against ISIL and its supporters, even as the country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the "firecrackers" would not affect "the will of the nation". After calling an emergency security meeting, President Hassan Rouhani called on world leaders to unite to combat "extremism". During the holy month of Ramadan in 2016, Iran said it also foiled an attack in the country [Reuters] 'Cowardly attackers' But the attack, which left at least 39 people injured, was a clear assault on both secular and religious pillars of the Iranian society, said Amir Havasi, a journalist at Tehran's leading English-language financial newspaper. "The parliament is a symbol of Iran's struggle against monarchy and enforcing the Constitution, and the [Khomeini] mausoleum is a symbol of the revolution's triumph," Havasi told Al Jazeera. Sitting next to Tehran's largest mosque in the central part of the city, the pyramid-like structure known as Baharestan, houses the 290-seat unicameral parliament, or the Majlis. The actual attack took place in an adjoining building, where the offices of the parliament members are located. Reports said the attackers failed to reach the main hall.

(25:02) Images and videos posted online showed shots flying out from the upper floors of the building, as special forces and police fought off the attackers for several hours. Afterwards, Iran's Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani denounced the "cowardly attackers", even as he downplayed it as a "minor incident". "Iran is an active and effective hub for combating terrorism, and terrorists wish to undermine such activities," he was quoted by Mehr News Agency as saying. The other attack hit the Khomeini shrine, which houses the tomb of the revered architect of the 1979 Iranian Revolution and the country's first supreme leader, who died in 1989. The complex, located about 30km south of the city and halfway to Tehran's main international airport, attracts hundreds of thousands of pilgrims every year. It was also hit by a suicide attack in 2009 . In the latest incident, one of the attackers was caught on phone camera blowing up an explosive, as shots rang out and visitors ran for protection. It was unclear if all the attackers at the shrine were also killed. According to an earlier report, two attackers were "arrested". Authorities also said it prevented a third attack, but did not disclose the location. 'Audacious attack' Javad Zarif, Rouhani's foreign minister, who is in Ankara to meet Turkish leaders, condemned the attack saying "terrorism" is a problem in the Middle East and the rest of the world. "The region is witnessing worrisome developments for us," he told reporters. Out in the streets of Tehran, p olitical analyst Amir Havasi told Al Jazeera it was back to normal after the attack. "From what I have seen so far, ordinary life is continuing. People are still taking the subway, using public transportation," he said. #TehranAttacks pic.twitter.com/2WvTnEje9v — Sadegh Ghorbani (@GhorbaniSadegh) June 7, 2017 Still, the "audacious attack" on Wednesday raises questions about security in the Iranian capital, which is known as a "safe city", said Al Jazeera's Andrew Simmons, who has extensively covered Iran, including the latest presidential election. "Here, we have a credibly well-planned attack," he said. "Why did these people slipped through the net?" "Tehran is always been known as a safe city. Its people are not used to this sort of attack. What the government faces right now is a security problem." He said it could result in the newly re-elected and moderate president taking a harder line on the issue of security and surveillance .

Bashar al-Assad's regime has concluded deals worth billions with Russia and Iran [Reuters/SANA] "Al Assad has won the war," declared Charles Glass in a recent piece for Stratfor, comparing the Syrian dictator to a Chicago mayor winning a re-election after cracking down on anti-war protests in the 1960s. In this rather bizarre attempt to draw a historical parallel, Glass misses an important point: Mayor Richard Daley did not have a foreign occupying power help him maintain a murderous regime against the wishes of Chicago residents. And Bashar al-Assad has not just one occupying power on his side, but two: Russia and Iran. And while the two fight his battles for him in the east and south, Assad is able to put up a show of alleged stability in Damascus, where nightclubs opening their doors are impressing Glass. And when this all ends, unlike Daley, Assad will not have a popular mandate to rule; he is and will be a foreign-occupation-backed tyrant. How Assad 'won' the war In 2012 and early 2013, Assad's regime was quickly losing control over rural territories across the country; desertion rates from his army for both regular soldiers and officers were skyrocketing as many refused to follow orders and shoot innocent protesters. At that time, the balance of power on the ground looked like it was leaning in favour of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and various Islamist groups, backed by Western and Gulf states. That's when the Iranians started coming. When Syrians from Damascus started reporting seeing them arrive by the busload in 2013, they were accused of exaggerating. By 2015 it was clear Iranians were fighting for Assad and not doing that well. So in July of that year Qassem Soleimani, breaking a travel ban, was dispatched to Moscow. Two months later, Russia started its "air force only" "anti-terrorism" military intervention by bombing positions of the FSA. When opposition forces said they captured and killed a Russian soldier in late 2015, political analysts I know personally were quick to dismiss the opposition's claims that Russian intervention had gone beyond air attacks and supplying weapons to the Assad regime, asserting that Russia would never actually take the risk of putting its soldiers on the ground in Syria. {articleGUID} Then, when the Russian and Iranian governments finally began to admit their soldiers were being killed in Syria on the battlefield, observers and media outlets could no longer deny that the occupation was far more entrenched than they had cared to acknowledge. Estimates from 2015 indicate that the regime's manpower has dropped to somewhere around 80,000 troops. In 2016 Iranian fighters were estimated to number 70,000 (with Iran actually paying 250,000 fighters) and Russian fighters anywhere between 4,000 and 10,000, although Moscow is said to be supporting several regime-allied militias and military units as well. These numbers are disturbing, but there are two other, more alarming trends emerging with regards to Russian and Iranian manpower in Syria. The first is the employment of marginalised groups in their home countries to fight for them in Syria, such as Iran's Fatimeyon Force, which reportedly numbers around 20,000 Afghans (some forced into service facing threats of imprisonment), and Russia's military police force, which has sent 1,200 Chechens and Ingush "volunteers" . The second trend will have a more direct and long-lasting impact on Syria's social fabric, increasing mistrust between citizens and threatening what is left of fragile Syrian bonds. Documents recently obtained by a Syrian opposition paper show that a defence ministry memo circulated in April 2017 refers to 90,000 Syrians fighting for local militias run directly by Iran and comprising of mainly Syrian Shia Muslims from both the civilian population and defectors or deserters from the Syrian Arab Army. So long as Assad continues be an obedient tyrant, throwing contracts their way and allowing them to control not only their fighters, but also large factions of Syrian fighters, Iran and Russia can continue to implement their agenda in Syria. The memo, which was reportedly presented to Assad, makes recommendations on how members of these militias should be treated and how the leadership could be brought closer to the regime's own army. This seems to be a futile exercise because the loyalties of such militias now lie with Iran, who is paying their salaries while encouraging their participation in fighting based solely on sectarianism. In other words, Assad is hardly in charge of what happens on the ground militarily. Iranian and Russian 'investment' in Syria Iran says it is intervening in Syria to support resistance against Israel and protect Syrian sovereignty, as well as preserve its own existence. Russia says it is intervening in Syria to stand against western imperialism and fight terrorism. But the reality is that their interventions-turned-occupations are not purely idealistic, noble policy positions: both are also profiting politically and economically from their interventions. After Aleppo was devastated by these three actors (Iran, Russia and the regime) in late 2016, Iranian firm Mabna was awarded multi-million dollar contracts by the Assad regime to restore the electricity infrastructure in the city. In 2014 and 2015, reports began to emerge of Iranian traders buying not only shops and businesses in Damascus and Homs, but also farmlands and areas around religious sites . {articleGUID} The political and military gains are also significant for Russia. A deal signed with the Assad regime gives Russia control and access to its only naval port (the Tartus naval base) in the Mediterranean, as well as to the Hmaimim airbase in Latakia, for the next half-century . After signing nearly one billion dollars in infrastructure deals with Russia by April 2016, the Assad regime, mere months later, then promised Russia priority in awarding contracts to rebuild infrastructure in Syria. According to Russian publication Fontanka, at least one Russian company has already acquired contracts giving it a 25-percent stake in profits from oil wells if it helps liberate and secure them. But that's not all. Russia is now seen as the point of contact for all things relating to Syria: even nations who have spoken out against Assad are now following Russia's signals for next steps in Syria. Put simply, it's not just the military Assad has lost control of, it's also the economy. Assad must go, but so must Russia and Iran It is impossible to reason with Syrians (and Arabs, for that matter) who continue to defend and support Assad and claim that it is because he stands against Israel and its occupation of Palestine. For some reason, they are blind to the fact that Assad is doing to Syria what Israel has done to Palestine, making it a land in which Iran and Russia are calling the shots and determining Syria's future. Currently, Assad is still being used by both Iran and Russia because so far, he has not disappointed them, a real-life example of the popular Arabic saying: they tell him to go left, he goes left; they tell him to go right, he goes right. So long as Assad continues to be an obedient tyrant, throwing contracts their way and allowing them to control not only their fighters, but also large factions of Syrian fighters, Iran and Russia can continue to implement their agenda in Syria. And if, at some point, Assad can no longer offer them these incentives, Russia and Iran have created an environment in which they do not need his presence to usurp what is left of Syria.

Ever since one of his earliest 'posthumous' novels The Moor's Last Sigh (1995) I have no longer been able to read Rushdie without a bizarre sensation I am reading an impostor, writes Dabashi [Reuters] In a recent flight, I was sitting a couple of rows behind Salman Rushdie on the British Airways flight 178 from New York to London. It was an eerie experience. On my way to the bathroom, I could see he was playing a video card game on his mobile phone. I was not even tempted to go forward and introduce myself. I can scarcely stand the man. Plus: can you imagine a bearded Iranian man approaching Salman Rushdie on a plane flying at 37,000 feet towards London. The man may freak out and relive the opening gambit of his Satanic Verses. Which one of us would be Gibreel Farishta and which Saladin Chamcha? Nerve-wracking! I have met Salman Rushdie though, years ago when, in the heydays of the notorious edict (fatwa) against him, the late Edward Said had invited him to visit Columbia. I remember the small gathering Edward had arranged for him was literally behind closed doors and by invitation only. Perhaps a dozen or so Columbia faculty and students had gathered to chat with the author of The Satanic Verses while he was still in hiding. This haphazard encounter early in October 2017, however, coincided with the publication of Salman Rushdie's most recent book, The Golden House , of which I was entirely unaware until I ran into a celebratory review in the Guardian - in which it was compared to F Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby and Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited. {articleGUID} I dutifully went and purchased a copy of the book and began reading it and, yet again, I could not help feeling I was reading an impostor. Why an imposter? Allow me to explain. The birth of an author I was still a graduate student when Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children (1981) appeared. Words fail to describe my joyous fascination in having discovered him. His voice was witty, brilliant, rambunctious, joyous - his prose revelatory, his politics familiar, his imagination trustworthy. I immediately placed him next to and up against VS Naipaul, whom the more I read the more I detested, especially after his horridly racist Among the Believers: An Islamic Journey (1981) that had come soon after the Iranian revolution of 1977-1979. Its sheer nasty arrogance could scarce conceal its ignorance of a revolution that had shaken my homeland to its foundations. My love at first read for Rushdie's Midnight's Children was no doubt in part animated by my revulsion against VS Naipaul. But long after my animus for Naipaul disappeared into indifference, my love and admiration for Midnight's Children only increased. I soon began reading the rest of Rushdie's work - his first novel, Grimus (1975), his other magnificent fiction, Shame (1983), and his travelogue to Nicaragua , The Jaguar Smile (1987), which appeared as I was deep into writing my first book on Iranian revolution, Theology of Discontent (1993). Rushdie's playful politics and his magic realism were palpable to me, happily familiar, a kind of Gabriel Garcia Marquez from my neighbourhood, I always thought. I basked in his nasty, naughty, joyous, playful, giggling, irksome prose. This happy discovery of a new author continued well into the publication of his Satanic Verses (1988), of which I first read a review, I believe in Times Literary Supplement, upon its British release, which was before its US publication. I was so excited to read this new novel, I asked a friend in London to buy and send it to me to New York and I read it before it was published in the US . I found his Satanic Verses utterly magnificent, and I recall referring to it in a conference on Shia passion play at Hartford Seminary in Hartford, Connecticut, citing it as a perfect example of how old stories and even sanctities can be put into urgent contemporary (exilic) fiction. Ever since one of his earliest 'posthumous' novels, The Moor's Last Sigh (1995), I have no longer been able to read Rushdie without a bizarre sensation I am reading an impostor. Long after I could no longer stand Rushdie's politics, I continued to include Satanic Verses in my various syllabi on postcolonial literature - marveling at while teaching the ecstasy of his prose - its virtuoso performativity, its bravura theatricals, its happy communion with English language, its bringing the Muslim sacrosanct forward for a rendezvous with a homely life away from home. Never ever (long after that horrid fatwa) did I think the novel an insult to Muslims. Quite to the contrary: it brought their sacrosanct to a renewed rendezvous with their history. In retrospect, I am happy to have had that first undiluted encounter with Rushdie's last novel before the whole hell broke loose on him and the rest of us who loved and admired his work. To this day, I read Satanic Verses with a fully conscious awareness of reading a great novel before it was sabotaged, verbally abused, narratively assassinated, and forever destroyed by one nasty ayatollah who had no freaking clue what the book was about. The death of an author The Guardian's Emma Brockes recently said of Rushdie: "At 70, Rushdie has had more public incarnations than most writers of literary fiction - brilliant novelist, man on the run, subject of tabloid scorn and government dismay, social butterfly, and, in that singularly British designation, man lambasted for being altogether too Up Himself - but it is often overlooked what good company he is." {articleGUID} I wish I could think of Rushdie that way: died and reincarnated multiple times. But alas for me, Rushdie died and never came back. As an author, he was born with that magnificent milestone novel Midnight's Children and died after a blindfolded revolutionary zealot put a price on his head, killed his person, confused his persona, corrupted his politics, and turned what was left into a pestiferous Islamophobe on par and paired with Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Sam Harris, Bill Maher and the rest of their detestable gang. If you have "been" with Salman Rushdie as long as I have since his birth as a magnificent writer, and through his ordeal with Khomeini's fatwa and subsequent moral degeneration into a bitter old Islamophobe, it is hard to resist the irrefutable feeling that the old ascetic Iranian Savonarola did, after all, manage to have the great inveterate novelist "assassinated" and what today we know as "Salman Rushdie" is a Picassoesque impostor - all his pieces might be there but the composition is contorted and grotesque. Ever since one of his earliest "posthumous" novels, The Moor's Last Sigh (1995), I have no longer been able to read Rushdie without a bizarre sensation I am reading an impostor. For that reason, I believe the writer who today goes by the name of "Salman Rushdie" offers literary theorists a unique case of "the death of the author", as we say. In 1967, Roland Barthes, the eminent French literary theorist, published his highly influential essay on the "Death of the author/La mort de l'auteur" in which he sought to decouple the autonomy of a text from the biography of its author. Though I find much interpretative energy lurking under the skin of Barthes' proposition, I still believe something of the authorial voice remains in the text by way of our imagining an omniscient narrator behind any other narrator who is speaking the story to us when we read or watch or listen to a text. I cannot listen to Wagner or read Heidegger without thinking they were despicable anti-Semites. My problem with Salman Rushdie's fiction is I can no longer imagine that omniscient ventriloquist crafting a world for me to enter and believe, to possess and behold. I can no longer tell one from the other. It is not that I don't like Salman Rushdie as a person or that I loathe his politics as much as I do the politics of those who put a price on his head. It is that the words "Salman Rushdie" no longer simply refer to a person, an author, a novelist, for those two words have become an overload of thick and conflicting memories preventing any direct and unmitigated encounter with the novels, memoirs, and essays he writes, as Barthes tells us to do. The fate of a nation Salman Rushdie himself (or I should rather say "itself") and that grand ayatollah who put a price on his head, both at each other's throat forever, have become a thick text, standing formidably before the books he writes. Hard as I try, I cannot pass that repellent gate to get to the book he keeps writing. That fatwa Khomeini issued against Rushdie has a far different tone to it in the ear of an Iranian who cares for the fate of his homeland. As the world attention was distracted by the smokescreen of a death sentence against a well-protected Indo-British author, Khomeini ordered the redrafting of an "Islamic constitution" (a contradiction in terms) into which now almost 80 million human beings are trapped. As European and North American liberals were falling head over shoulder to defend Rushdie's freedom of thought, Iranian en masse were being subjected to a pestiferous theocracy to this day. For millions of Iranians, the downfall of Ayatollah Montazeri as a far more humane successor to Khomeini and the substitution of the vindictive Ayatollah Khamenei is the legacy of that so-called "Rushdie Affair". The moment I reach that historic cul-de-sac is precisely the instance I suddenly remember the Salman Rushdie I used to read when I first encountered his fiction. A sudden sadness, a moment of mourning nostalgia, then dawns on me remembering an author I once so joyously discovered, so dearly loved reading, and now having so sadly forever lost. Who is this strange man impersonating Salman Rushdie? He is "Salman Rushdie", I then realise - forever condemned into two scare quotes, the signal citation of the fatwa a malignant man once issued against him. As Salman Rushdie and I and the rest of the passengers on that flight between New York and London deplaned and entered Terminal Five at Heathrow Airport I was walking right behind him. He had put a light blue baseball cap on while walking on a moving sidewalk. At one point, he turned right towards the yellow sign for "Arrival" and I turned left towards the purple sign for "Transit". He had reached his destination in London. I still had a long way to go somewhere else. The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial policy.

Amano was in Tehran to discuss the latest developments around the Iran's nuclear programme [Presidential Official Website/EPA] Tehran, Iran - What would have been a routine visit by the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) became a public relations opportunity for the Iranian government. Yukiya Amano was in Tehran on Sunday, his first visit since US President Donald Trump told Congress that Iran is not complying with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), more commonly known as the 2015 nuclear deal. The IAEA chief put a positive face on proceedings, but the stakes are high. This time, his verification of compliance was a moment of vindication for Iran and another international rebuke of the White House. "Ladies and gentleman, I am very happy to come to your country again," Amano said during a press conference at Iran's nuclear agency. "Since January 2016, the IAEA has been monitoring and verifying the nuclear related commitments made by Iran under the JCPOA. The IAEA believes that the JCPOA is a significant gain for verification. The IAEA can state that the nuclear-related commitments made by Iran under the JCPOA are being implemented," he added. 'Message to Trump' There was no ambiguity in his comments to journalists. There was even a message that sounded tailor-made for Trump. "The most important thing is to be factual," Amano said. "I have always been factual since I became director general of the IAEA. Sometimes I have to report bad news but I also report the good news. It is very important to stick to the rules and I will continue to do so." Before meeting with Amano, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani was speaking in an open session of parliament. He took the opportunity to slam the US and restate his country's commitment to its own defence. "You object to our weapons, we are going to manufacture and store any kind of weapons we need," Rouhani said. "And this is to defend ourselves and the unity of our land and people. And we will not hesitate to use them in the appropriate time to defend ourselves. "You know, that we have built, are building and will continue to build missiles, and this doesn't violate international law or the international resolution (JCPOA). We will continue to reinforce our defence abilities and to defend our national security. And if there is any violation of the United States's commitments, we will react strongly," Rouhani said. The White House has said Iran's development of a missile programme is a threat to regional security and violates the spirit of the nuclear deal. Non-nuclear inspections For Iran's leaders, Amano's visit was an opportunity to remind the world they have passed every nuclear inspection with flying colours. "So far, eight times, the IAEA has released reports that state that Iran has met its commitments fully," said Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Agency of Iran. Salehi, Amano's counterpart in Iran, also said demands by the Trump White House to inspect non-nuclear military facilities - something that was kept out of the original nuclear deal - are a waste of time. "Military bases are not part of the deal … so it's useless to talk about them," he said. The pressure to keep the peace is now on European shoulders. "Americans are not implementing the nuclear deal, let's be frank," said Emad Abshenass, a Tehran-based political analyst. "[As long as] all the other countries stick by the nuclear deal, the nuclear deal is there." The IAEA chief reminded Iranians that his organisation will continue to monitor and verify the JCPOA "in an impartial and objective and stringent manner" - even Trump has struggled to criticise Iran's technical compliance with the deal. But the US's current Iran policy has more to do with Iran's emboldened role in the Middle East and less to do with dismantling the JCPOA. While the nuclear deal opened the door for international banks and businesses to deal with Iran, the US is blocking the doorway. The threat of new sanctions from the US is having the same effect as actual sanctions. "What happens is that most of the international companies, they don't know what to do," Abshenass said, adding: "They are afraid to invest or start implementing their agreements with Iran … so all of the agreements are on hold right now. They have signed the deals, they have signed the agreements but none of them is being implemented. Everyone is afraid of what might happen." Iranians say this is a violation of the agreement. And while Iran's government would prefer to keep the nuclear deal intact, Tehran's distrust of the US government is growing. Salehi told journalists that if the nuclear deal were to fall apart because of US actions, it could put global non-proliferation into question. And in his speech to parliament, Rouhani said the Trump White House is not an honest broker. "The US should abandon negotiations and treaties with the world given the path it has taken," Rouhani said. "The administration of a country that violates the international obligations of the previous administration is not trustworthy." SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Middle East Iran Hassan Rouhani
Iran's missile programme is not covered by the 2015 nuclear deal [Vahid Salemi/AP] Iran has no need to extend the current 2,000km range of its ballistic missiles as they can already strike enemy targets in case of aggression, the head of the Revolutionary Guard has said. Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari told reporters in the capital, Tehran, on Tuesday that the missile range can cover "most of American interest and forces" within the region, even as he underlined the programme's defensive purpose. Jafari said the ballistic missile range is based on the limits set by the country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

"There is the capability to increase this range, but it is sufficient for now as the Americans are present within a 2,000km radius around the country, and would get a response in the case of any invasion," the state-owned Press TV quoted him as saying. The Revolutionary Guard is a separate force from Iran's army. It answers only to the country's supreme leader. 'We will continue to build missiles' Meanwhile, Iran's military chief of staff Mohammad Hussein Bagheri was quoted as saying on Tuesday that the military is trying to improve the accuracy of its ballistic missiles, but added that they are not intended to carry nuclear warheads.

Roughly 63 factions make up Iraq's PMF, an umbrella of groups rallied by ethnic and tribal leaders [Getty Images] For almost two years, US-backed Iraqi government forces, along with Kurdish Peshmerga forces and other allies, fought to push ISIL fighters out of the country. One of the key actors, who played a major role in the campaign declared by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi , were Shia-dominated paramilitaries. Roughly 63 factions make up Iraq's Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF, also known as PMU) - an umbrella of groups rallied by ethnic and tribal leaders, whose fighters are either loyal to religious scholars, Iraqi political leaders, or Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The diverse makeup of the PMF's 40 divisions - comprising more than 60,000 fighters - sheds light on many of Iraq's sectarian tensions and its ambiguous political future. {articleGUID} Although formed via a religious decree to fight ISIL in 2014 by Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's top Shia religious scholar, many of the fighters are empowered by Iran and other non-state actors. Some have existed for decades prior, and others have political representation in parliament. The PMF is largely outside government control, yet the Iraqi parliament formally recognised it as a state-affiliated institution when its own forces became depleted in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group (ISIL, also known as ISIS). There are three main distinct factions in the PMF with various ideological underpinnings: those loyal to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; those loyal to Iraqi popular Shia religious leader Muqtada al-Sadr, who heads the Peace Brigades; and those loyal to Sistani. All of these groups have one thing in common: They are backed by Iran and have become the most powerful military force in Iraq, analysts say, since ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi stood at the pulpit of Mosul's Grand al-Nuri mosque and announced the creation of a Sunni caliphate. Since the PMF is not a single unified body, its various factions operate under the policy recommendations of different heads. Political recognition The PMF has not publicly demanded political recognition in Baghdad due to the absence of government control and the involvement of non-state actors. However, two main groups already have political recognition and are members of the Iraqi parliament. The Badr organisation, which is part of a coalition - the National Iraqi Alliance (NIA) - is headed by former Iraqi Transport Minister Hadi al-Ameri. Out of the Iraqi parliament's 328 seats, the NIA holds 183 seats, 22 of which belong to the Badr organisation. The Badr organisation was well established in Iraq's political system prior to 2014, and before entering the realm of politics was previously known as the Badr Brigades, Iran's oldest proxy in Iraq. The other, Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq, is a Shia armed group founded by Qais al-Khazali. One member of the group is currently sitting in parliament, Chatham House fellow Renad Mansour told Al Jazeera. "These [groups] will continue to be involved in politics," he said. Basically, the PMF became an umbrella for anyone who wanted to fight ISIL … There is no standard process to say ok, you are now part of the PMF - it's a loose term. Renad Mansour, Chatham House Considered to be the senior, de-facto leaders of the PMF, Ameri and Khazali have established close ties to the PMF's administrator, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who works in alignment with the two and is among the PMF's leadership. Muhandis is an Iraqi military commander who leads organisations close to Iran's Quds Force, an IRGC offshoot that oversees operations overseas. Like Ameri, he is considered to be among the top military leaders who have maintained close ties with Tehran. {articleGUID} "There is no question that someone like Hadi al-Ameri definitely has political ambition. He was upset when he wasn't made interior minister by Abadi a few years ago, but continues to influence the Ministry of Interior because the Badr organisation has a lot of influence in that industry," Mansour said. "And they have good relations with Nouri al-Maliki, the former Iraqi prime minister, and he created the PMF." According to Mansour, who frequently travels to Iraq, it has become clear that Ameri's popularity in the Badr organisation increased significantly through the fight against ISIL. "When we used to go to Baghdad, we'd see big posters with pictures of martyrs and the logo of the organisation - so basically, using the fight against ISIL, and using slogans like 'we defended Iraq, we defended Baghdad, from Daesh [ISIL]', either way to gain political favour," he said. "But at the same time, Abadi's influence has also grown, so it's a struggle between these two spheres of influence." Facade of control Similarly, Middle East Forum analyst Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi told Al Jazeera that various PMF factions have been fighting to expand their political influence. "The idea is to gain ground for the 2018 parliamentary elections, using the victory over the Islamic State, preserving Iraq's unity and restoring security as playing cards," he said. Despite this, many other smaller PMF factions who emerged in 2014 remain weak, although political ambitions among them cannot be ruled out, Tamimi said. Prior to becoming a state-recognised institution, the PMF received much of its budget from Iran. Currently, the PMF reportedly receives about $1.5bn a year from Abadi's government - but Muhandis, the PMF's administrator, decides where to allocate the funds. "The government doesn't have much control over it," Mansour said. The lack of transparency with budget management has resulted in smaller factions claiming they have not received salaries. Some, said Mansour, have accused Muhandis of favouritism. Since taking office in September 2014, Abadi has worked on developing Iraq's security sector and has succeeded in revamping "three or four divisions, including the police", Mansour said, "but he needs the PMF as well … that's why there is still a role for the PMF". According to Tamimi, Abadi allowed for the recognition of the PMF in hopes of being able to control them. "The idea of the numbering for brigades, for example, is probably based on the idea that the PMF should not be political, but function as a reserve force of the state," he said. Tamimi noted that some PMF factions "clearly" have a good relationship with state institutions, but others are tied to pro-Iranian factions, which have an agenda differing from Abadi's. Where were they before ISIL? According to Mansour, seven groups existed before the 2014 decree and Maliki's creation of the PMF. "Some have existed for decades and used to be a part of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, which was Ayatollah al-Hakim's party," said Mansour, referencing the late Iraqi top Shia leader. Some of the pre-existing groups fought against the United States and the Iraqi state itself, but have since shifted closer towards Iran and Maliki, such as Sadr's Peace Brigades. Iran realises that Abadi isn't someone they can trust completely, so they need to work with people like Nouri al-Maliki and other PMF leaders to ensure that they have influence on the ground. Renad Mansour When Maliki was in office back in 2010, he grew closer to the Badr organisation and to Khazali's forces - essentially relying on them, Mansour said. {articleGUID} "These seven groups continued to exist in one way or another until 2014, when they created a commission, and then, 50 or so more groups emerged - some of them just local groups, some just gangs and criminal networks, and others tribal forces including Sunnis, Christians, Turkmen," he said. "Basically, the PMF became an umbrella for anyone who wanted to fight ISIL … There is no standard process to say ok, you are now part of the PMF - it's a loose term." Iranian proxy After taking control of the Kurdish-held province of Kirkuk, Iraqi forces, backed by PMF fighters, defeated Peshmerga forces on the outskirts of the oil-rich city. Over the past week, Abadi has sought to maintain relationships with neighbouring countries as he visited Turkey, Iran and Jordan, while preserving an alliance with the US - a move Mansour said was aimed at limiting Iranian influence in Iraq. "Iran realises that Abadi isn't someone they can trust completely, so they need to work with people like Nouri al-Maliki and other PMF leaders to ensure that they have influence on the ground," he said. According to him, Iran's main objectives are to ensure that Iraq remains stable, and to ensure that whoever is leading Iraq is "loyal, but then again not too powerful at the same time". While it is unlikely for rival PMF factions to seek political recognition in Baghdad, it is in Iran's best interests for various PMF groups to expand or gain a political foothold "as a means of ensuring Iraq remains an ally of Tehran", Tamimi said. "From Iran's perspective, it is best to have multiple pro-Iranian Shia factions and have them compete for influence, with Iran acting as kingmaker among the various groups." Given the country's large Shia population, it is difficult to unite Iraq's Shia behind one ideology or a single ideological group. In 2014, when Sistani issued the religious decree calling on Iraqis to fight against ISIL, he referred to potential fighters as volunteers. In his statement, Sistani urged fighters to steer away from violence so as not to threaten Iraq's long-term stability. And, earlier this year, local media reported that his office expressed concern over the actions committed by various PMF subgroups. "Sistani is against what happened with the PMF, and is against what is largely a misinterpretation of the decree - the misuse and politicisation of it," Mansour said. As such, both Mansour and Tamimi agreed that the differing loyalties of PMF factions create the possibility of future infighting, as well as infighting for less ideological reasons, such as "control of extortion opportunities in various areas".

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani delivers remarks at a news conference during the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, US, September 20, 2017 [Stephanie Keith/Reuters] Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said Tehran will continue to produce missiles for defence purposes and does not believe its missile development programme violates international accords. In a speech to parliament on Sunday, Rouhani also hit out at the US , calling negotiations with Washington "madness." "We have built, are building and will continue to build missiles," the 68-year-old was quoted by State TV as saying. "We are not contradicting UN Resolution 2231 ." Rouhani's comments come after US President Donald Trump r efused to certify Iran's compliance with a landmark 2015 deal curtailing Tehran's nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. Trump has repeatedly criticised the accord, which was negotiated by the Obama administration and enshrined under United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231, as "the worst deal ever" and "an embarrassment". Under the agreement, Tehran agreed to limit its disputed nuclear programme in return for the easing of economic sanctions. Iran has repeatedly denied its missile development breaches the resolution, saying its missiles are not designed to carry nuclear weapons . On Saturday, Iranian army Brigadier General Ahmad Reza Pourdastan also rejected the idea of discussing the country's missile capabilities, calling it "not negotiable." "Our missile might is among the capabilities that are not negotiable at all," Iran's Tasnim news agency quoted Pourdastan as saying.

In a televised speech, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri said he believed he faced threats to his life [Reuters] The snap resignation of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri over the weekend reflects a push by Saudi Arabia to openly confront Iran, its longtime regional adversary, and Iran's Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, analysts say. It will also likely plunge Lebanon into a fresh political quagmire, as the country's fragile coalition government suffers a severe blow and general elections set for May appear increasingly uncertain. Joseph Bahout, a visiting fellow with the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, noted that tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran have been building for some time, and the Saudis have recently shown "a will [to confront] Iran and Hezbollah in Lebanon". Hariri, a Lebanese Sunni politician and longtime ally of the Gulf kingdom, announced his resignation from Riyadh, the Saudi capital, on Saturday. {articleGUID} In a televised speech, Hariri said he believed he faced threats to his life. He called out Iran for sowing "disorder and destruction" in Lebanon, and criticised Hezbollah, a Lebanese political and armed resistance movement allied with Tehran, for building "a state within a state". "I say to Iran and its allies - you have lost in your efforts to meddle in the affairs of the Arab world," Hariri said, adding that the region "will rise again and the hands that you have wickedly extended into it will be cut off." Questions over Saudi's role Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was appointed last June, has recently taken a harsher line on Iran. The long-standing power struggle between the two regional rivals has been playing out in Syria, where Hezbollah is fighting with Iran's backing alongside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, and in Yemen. "The Saudis feel that it's time for them to be much more aggressive against what they perceive or describe as Iran's expansion in the region," Bahout told Al Jazeera. "The new thing is that they have decided to throw Lebanon into this kind of fire."

Saudi Minister of State for Gulf Affairs Thamer al-Sabhan told Lebanese television station LBC on Saturday that it was entirely Hariri's decision to step down. Nonetheless, the resignation comes amid increasingly hostile rhetoric from Sabhan himself, who recently posted several tweets condemning Hezbollah, which he described as a "terrorist" force. "Those who cooperate and work with it politically, economically and through the media should be punished," Sabhan wrote on October 26. "There should be serious work to curb it internally and externally and to confront it with force." Hariri's resignation speech mirrored Sabhan's language. And just days earlier, on October 31, Hariri posted a photo to Twitter of himself with Sabhan, captioned: "Long meeting with His Excellency my friend Thamer al-Sabhan." Tawfiq Shuman, a Lebanese journalist and analyst, told Al Jazeera Arabic that because Hariri delivered his statement from Riyadh, "he had to use the same tone and language the kingdom uses when speaking about Hezbollah." This language "is one of war, military and confrontation", Shuman said. Bahout maintained that Saudi Arabia appears to be behind Hariri's decision to resign, noting that the Saudis would not have made such a move unless they felt they had the blessing of the United States, another longtime ally. "They feel the climate is right now," Bahout said. "In the longer run, I think the real question is, how far are the Saudis willing to go? What's their aim?" US pressure In recent months, the Trump administration has been increasingly critical of Hezbollah, which the US has listed as a "terrorist" group since the late 1990s. US President Donald Trump has also spoken out against Iran and the nuclear deal signed between Tehran and Western nations. Last month, the US Congress unanimously approved additional sanctions on Hezbollah and foreign states that support the group. Israel also used Hariri's resignation as an opportunity to speak out against Iran. {articleGUID} Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted late Saturday that the resignation was "a wakeup call to the international community to take action against the Iranian aggression that is trying to turn Syria into a second Lebanon". The resignation comes amid "a very heightened, anti-Hezbollah discourse", said Carmen Geha, an assistant professor of public administration at the American University of Beirut. Hezbollah Secretary-General Hasan Nasrallah is expected to comment on Hariri's resignation on Sunday. Geha told Al Jazeera that she expects Nasrallah's speech to accuse Hariri of defecting towards the Saudis and to proclaim the importance of Hezbollah's role in the region. "I don't think it is going to be conciliatory at all," she said. What are the next steps? Internally, Bahout said Hariri's resignation plunges Lebanon into what could be "a very long governmental crisis". General elections are set for next May, but a vote would be unlikely to go ahead if a government is not in place, he said. Officially, Lebanese President Michel Aoun must accept Hariri's resignation. Aoun, who is allied with Hezbollah, will then be tasked with appointing a new prime minister, who, under Lebanon's sectarian political system, must be a Sunni Muslim. However, that will be far from easy, as the Hariri-led coalition government was put in place last year after several years of political deadlock in Lebanon. Geha told Al Jazeera that while the Lebanese cabinet can continue on an operational basis, it appears more likely that the Lebanese political system "will go into complete paralysis". "Either there will be an indication of a will to have a minimum of socioeconomic stability at least, or not, which I feel is more likely," said Geha, who added that she expected political polarisation to deepen as a result of Hariri's resignation. Geha said there is no lack of Lebanese Sunni politicians who can replace Hariri, but if his resignation is tied to Saudi Arabia, a regional consensus over a potential successor may be necessary. "I think this time, it will be difficult" to replace the prime minister, she said. "If this is Saudi-led … it will take a lot of regional consensus-building."

Students carry signs showing Trump with his mouth zipped shut [Zein Basravi/Al Jazeera] Tehran, Iran - Just hours after a data dump by the CIA alleging among other things collusion between Iran and al-Qaeda, Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister, responded via Twitter . "A record low for the reach of petrodollars: CIA & FDD fake news w/ selective AlQaeda docs re: Iran can't whitewash role of US allies in 9/11," Zarif said. The target of his criticism was the CIA and the US-based Foundation for the Defence of Democracies (FDD). Both organisations have been at the centre of the latest revelations from a trove of computer files found on al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's hard drives. He was killed by a US Navy SEAL team during a raid on his compound in Pakistan in 2011. The allusion in Zarif's tweet is a commonly held belief in Iran: that al-Qaeda's September 11, 2001, attacks on the US were an inside job. The accusation may seem outlandish for a sitting foreign minister of any country to level. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5633058446001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5633058446001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: CIA documents purport to show links between Iran and Osama bin Laden (1:41) But to an Iranian, the message is clear: The US is the main protagonist of "terror" in the world and has no business hurling accusations against Iran. This is not the first time that Iran has been accused of secret dealings with al-Qaeda. In years past, Iran's government has dismissed this kind of things as Western propaganda. Now the accusation is coming at a time when Iran sees itself as a regional counterterror powerhouse. "I think this is part of a psychological war launched by America and by the CIA against Iran to disgrace Iran's face in the international arena," Hossain Ansarifard, a Tehran-based political analyst, told Al Jazeera. "Iran is encircled by al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and [it] is trying to manage these activities on [its] borders. "Everybody knows that al-Qaeda's ideological principles are quite against Iran and against Iran's regime. So, it's ridiculous to say that they are working with and they are collaborating with Iran." Strategic sense For an outside observer, the allegation carries some logic. Iran's foreign policy is nothing if not driven by self-interest, so this would seem to make strategic sense. And both al-Qaeda and Iran see the US as the enemy. But when it comes to making foreign policy, the enemy of Iran's enemy is not Iran's friend. "We say America is the enemy and al-Qaeda is the enemy, too," Ansarifard said. In a speech to students in Tehran on Thursday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said, the country will never accept being bullied over the 2015 nuclear deal Iran sees itself as a regional counterterror powerhouse [Zein Basravi/Al Jazeera] Since US President Donald Trump decertified the deal to US Congress in October, paving the way for new US sanctions, the decision has received nearly daily public rebukes from Iranian leaders. "Any retreat by Iran will make America more blatant and impudent," Khamenei said, adding: "Resistance is the only option." That kind of defiance is a product of Iran's own experience with American intervention, as well as the more recent history of the second Iraq war that toppled Saddam Hussein. That conflict was preceded by similar allegations of ties to al-Qaeda as well as the existence of weapons of mass destruction. Neither accusation was proved true in the end but caused generations of chaos and conflict across the region. 'Cannot happen again' Iran's leaders say that kind of thing cannot happen again. On Tuesday, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps was the keynote speaker at an event entitled, A World Without Terror. "If you are waiting for a world without terror and terrorism, we should be after a world without the United States," Mohammad Ali Jafari said. Like Zarif, he also asserted that 9/11 was an inside job. The attack, he said, was orchestrated as a pretext to invade Afghanistan and Iraq. He also suggested that ISIL and the US are partners in crime in the Middle East . {articleGUID} "If Iran wasn't involved in Syria and Iraq, today [ISIL] would control these countries, and hand in hand with the U.S., would kill Muslims," he said. The optics were carefully managed. Young high school boys were brought in buses to fill an auditorium next to a museum for martyrs. Outside the venue, students carried signs that showed the US president with his mouth zipped shut. Posters taped to nearby walls read: "Keep Calm and Shut Up Trump." Others showed a clenched fist holding a rubbish bag filled with the "tools of terrorism"; American money, American made guns and bullets, sticks of dynamite marked with the Star of David, and a keyboard signifying the threat of cyberattacks. Even before walking inside, attendees were given a snapshot of how Iran's government sees its place in the world; America - along with ally Israel - is the biggest threat to peace in the region, and Iran has the job of taking out the rubbish.

An adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the resignation was planned by the US and Saudi Arabia [File: The Associated Press] Iran has said that the resignation of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri on Saturday aims to "create tension in Lebanon and the entire region". In a statement on Iran's state news agency, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said his country rejects "Hariri's claims against Iran as a repetition of false and unfounded anti-Iran accusations by the Zionist regime, the Saudis and the Americans". In a surprise move, Hariri announced his resignation in a televised speech during a visit to the Saudi capital Riyadh, blaming Iran and its Lebanese ally, the Hezbollah movement, for his decision. Hariri said Iran had fomented "disorder and destruction" in the country and meddled in the internal affairs of Lebanon and other Arab states. Referring to Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, Hariri said: "Iran's arm ... has managed to impose a fait accompli on Lebanon through the power of its weapons" in the last few decades. "They have built a state within a state," he said. {articleGUID} "I say to Iran and its allies - you have lost in your efforts to meddle in the affairs of the Arab world," he continued, adding that the region "will rise again and the hands that you have wickedly extended into it will be cut off". Hariri's resignation has stoked fears of an escalation in the regional divide between Iran and the Gulf states, primarily Saudi Arabia, with Lebanon - a politically unstable country - on the front lines. "The sudden resignation of Mr. Hariri and its announcement in another country is not only a source of pity and wonder, but also indicates he is playing in a ground where the ill-wishers of the region have designed," Qasemi said in the statement. Hussein Sheikh al-Islam, adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also responded to Hariri's speech, saying the resignation was "done with planning by Donald Trump, the president of America, and Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia". Hariri, a leading Sunni politician, has been in office for less than a year, but previously served as prime minister between 2009 and 2011. He assumed office again in late 2016 in a power-sharing government headed by President Michel Aoun, a supporter of Hezbollah, whose members have been accused by the International Court of Justice of assassinating Hariri's father, Rafik, in a 2005 bombing. {articleGUID} The country spent two years in political deadlock without a president before Aoun's election in October 2016, after Hariri endorsed the latter - a move seen by some analysts as a sign of Iran's influence in Lebanon. On Friday, after a meeting with Hariri in Beirut, a senior adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader congratulated Lebanon for its stability and the formation of the coalition government. Hariri's resignation now casts doubt on Lebanon's political future . Walid Jumblatt, the leader of Lebanon's Druze and the Progressive Socialist Party, said Hariri's resignation could adversely affect the country. He said it was the latest evidence of a power struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and urged intensification of diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions. "Lebanon is too small and vulnerable to bear the economic and political burden that comes with this resignation," Jumblatt said via social media.

Cooperation in the Syrian conflict established trust between the governments and people of Russia and Iran [Reuters] Tehran, Iran - Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in Iran on Wednesday for a trilateral summit, which also includes Azerbaijan . Economic cooperation was at the top of Putin's agenda, specifically the completion of a rail link along the North-South Transport Corridor that runs through Iran and Azerbaijan and connects Russia to India. But bilateral talks between Russia and Iran on Syria and regional security issues also took centre stage. Photos published online showed Putin holding talks with President Hassan Rouhani and the country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. {articleGUID} On Wednesday, the head of Russia's state-controlled oil giant Rosneft also signed a road map with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) to build joint oil and gas projects worth $30bn. At any other time, a meeting between leaders of Iran and Russia would be routine diplomacy. However, in a de facto post-ISIL Syria - and Iraq - and with Iran's expanding influence in the region, talks between Moscow and Tehran are likely to shape future events in the region. "The Russians have now come to realise that if they have a true partner in this part of the world, it is Iran," said Mostafa Khosh Cheshm, a political analyst based in Tehran. With Iran's support, the Russian foray into Syria has been a battlefield success. Critics had feared it would be an Afghanistan-like quagmire, but instead, it allowed Russia to reposition itself diplomatically and at relatively little cost. Russian casualties have remained in the dozens, despite Moscow's multi-year involvement in the war. "Russia has revived its lost role," Khosh Cheshm said. "Once it was the former Soviet Union. It decomposed, it collapsed, and it lost everything. Now it's back on the stage. It's rising as a regional power that is soon going to be one of the world powers again." For Iran, having an ally that is much more influential in world equations is of infinite strategic value. Especially an ally it feels it can trust. President Hassan Rouhani had publicly positioned the 2015 nuclear agreement as a new beginning with the United States. But the devolution of that deal at the hands of President Donald Trump has pushed Iran even closer to Russia. "[Iranian leaders] have come to realise they need to pick up Russia and China as their strategic partners," Khosh Cheshm said. "The same approach was in place with President [Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad." Both Russia and Iran are involved in the Astana talks aimed at resolving Syria's civil war [AFP] Cooperation in the Syrian conflict established trust between the governments and people of Russia and Iran. "In foreign policy, we never have everlasting friends and everlasting enemies [but] Iran and Russia are developing their strategic ties, and I believe they are in their spring," Khosh Cheshm said. "There is much time left to their winter. They're just at the beginning." The day before Putin's visit, a Russian company broke ground on two new power plants due to be built at the Bushehr nuclear facility. The project is expected to take 10 years. The two countries are also dominating the outcome of the Astana talks. A framework for peace in post-war Syria will no doubt take the shape Russia and Iran say it should. But as the victors of the war, what are their plans for Syria's people? Davoud Hermidas Bavand was born in 1934 and has spent his entire career as a diplomat. He also served as a member of Iran's delegation to the United Nations. {articleGUID} He says the humanitarian conditions in Syria are a tragedy that cannot be condoned. "I think that Syria turned out to be the victim of rivalry between three powers in the Middle East; Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran," Bavand said. "But bad or good, it has happened already. So the only way is to try to [come] together to pick up Syria and return refugees to Syria." Bavand said too much blood had been spilled for President Bashar al-Assad to remain in power. And, although his removal would have seemed inconceivable a year ago, Iranian leaders may be more amenable to the idea now. Without the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) to fill a power vacuum, Bavand said it might be easier to make a quiet change at the top and focus on the welfare of the Syrian people. "Now the reality is that constructive negotiations continue for a new government and a free election under the auspices of the United Nations," Bavand said. "Ipso facto, Bashar al-Assad would be removed from the position of power and we hope the new government or coalition could be stable enough to maintain peace and security in Syria and the people would be able to return to their hometowns."

Imad Harb, a political analyst at the Arab Center in Washington, DC, said that for Hariri to make the announcement in Riyadh "basically means he can't have control over his government or his country. "Hezbollah has been in control of the Lebanese state for quite a while and now it's a supposed victory in Syria on the side of the Syrian regime," Harb told Al Jazeera, referring to Hezbollah's role in fighting alongside forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has slowly taken back control over his country following a six-year civil war. "This has definitely affected Hariri's decision to resign, I have no doubt that maybe he is afraid for his life." 'Surprise coup' Speaking from Beirut, Kamel Wazne, a Lebanese political analyst, told Al Jazeera: "This is a surprise coup by all measures. Everything was fine within the country. "There is an election coming up. Everybody is talking about planning for of the economic future of the country, and a call came from Saudi Arabia and everything changed. "This comes in light of imminent American sanctions against Lebanon, certain threats coming from Israel and escalation by the Saudis. "I think the prime minister probably caved in to the demands of the Saudis and he declared his resignation from Saudi Arabia. This does not bode very well for the stability of Lebanon."

Bazzi, right, and Keshavarzian both had their security clearances denied [New York University] New York University's journalism department has voted to end its relationship with its campus in the United Arab Emirates following allegations two professors were denied visas because of their religious affiliation. NYU's Arthur L Carter Journalism Institute said it would discontinue its relationship with NYU Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) amid claims journalism professor Mohamad Bazzi, a Lebanese-born Shia , and Arang Keshavarzian, an Iranian-born politics professor, were denied visas because of their "Shia origins". In a letter to NYU President Andrew Hamilton, 17 academic staff said if the professors were denied visas due to their religious beliefs, it would pose a "significant threat to academic freedom on that campus". "Since a member of our faculty has been prohibited from teaching at NYU Abu Dhabi, the Carter Journalism Institute is not prepared to continue its relationship with NYUAD," the department said. The university should admit that it has bought into a political system that actively discriminates against members of a religious minority because of an overwhelming fear of Iran and hatred of Shia. Mohamad Bazzi, NYU Professor "Our faculty, a number of whose members have made the trip to NYUAD or taught courses there, voted unanimously at its last meeting to suspend the Institute's participation in the academic program in Abu Dhabi until these issues are satisfactorily resolved". I signed this letter to NYU's president from the Journalism faculty suspending our participation in NYU Abu Dhabi. pic.twitter.com/BgDjr7FFV8 — Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) November 3, 2017 In a New York Times op-ed in September, Bazzi detailed his experiences at NYUAD, saying he experienced discrimination while teaching there during month-long courses in January 2012 and 2013. He suggested his application was rejected due to his religious sect, something professors are required to state on forms issued by NYU and the UAE. "It is usually easy for American citizens to get a work visa for the UAE. Why was I denied?" he wrote. "When I taught a month-long journalism class at the Abu Dhabi campus, NYU administrators had told me they were worried that I would be denied a security clearance because of my Shia origins, and they twice held back on submitting my application. "They found a way around it by sending me on a tourist visa and describing me as a 'consultant'. "If NYU continues to accept Abu Dhabi's largesse, it needs to acknowledge the limitations that the Emirates' security and foreign policies impose on academic freedom. "At the very least, the university should admit that it has bought into a political system that actively discriminates against members of a religious minority because of an overwhelming fear of Iran and hatred of Shia. This is far from the free movement of people and ideas to which NYU's leaders claim to aspire." NYU's Gallatin School of Individualized Studies also urged its faculty not to teach or participate at the Abu Dhabi campus in a resolution passed earlier this week. Crackdown on academic freedom The UAE has increasingly cracked down on academic freedom and other liberties, since protests swept through the region after 2011's Arab Spring protests. Earlier this year, Nasser bin Ghaith, a prominent academic, was sentenced to 10 years in prison over a series of tweets critical of governments across the Arab world. Bin Ghaith was arrested and forcibly disappeared in August 2015 over what Amnesty International said was an unfair trial. In the summer of 2012, Matt Duffy, a journalism professor at Zayed University in Abu Dhabi, was also fired and forced to flee after he criticised media restrictions in the country.

Barzani had sought to make the Kurdish secession referendum his legacy [Khalid Mohammed/AP] Masoud Barzani, a former Peshmerga fighter, has led the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) since 1979, battling for autonomy for Iraq's Kurdish region. The KDP is one of the two dominant parties in the northern Kurdish region. Following the removal of Saddam Hussein, Iraq's former president, in the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq , Barzani was appointed to the interim Iraqi Governing Council, where he became an important player in achieving official recognition for the Kurdish region and its local government. As the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), a post he assumed in 2015, Barzani was one of the leading figures behind a September 25, 2017, vote on secession from Iraq. However, after an overwhelming victory in the non-binding referendum, relations quickly worsened between the KRG on the one hand and the Iraqi federal government, Turkey and Iran on the other hand. Barzani asked on October 29 the Kurdistan regional parliament not to renew his term as president after its expiration on November 1. The parliament approved his request in a closed session. Barzani's rise to power The son of Mustafa Barzani, a Kurdish nationalist hero, Barzani is often seen in traditional Kurdish dress and turban. Born in 1946, in Mahabad, Iran , he took control of the KDP after his father's death to continue battling the Iraqi government. He escaped an assassination attempt in 1979, while he was on a trip to Austria's capital, Vienna. In the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf war, when a US-led Western alliance fought Saddam over his invasion of Kuwait , Kurdish fighters, encouraged by the West, battled Baghdad. Although the West refused to intervene when Saddam crushed the Kurdish uprising, it later declared Iraq's Kurdish region a safe area and a "no-fly" zone above the 36th parallel. The move saw the erosion of the central government's powers from northern Iraq, prompting Barzani to evolve from Peshmerga fighter to political leader. The KDP banded together with the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), led by Jalal Talabani, to run the region. Talabani passed away on October, 3 2017, at the age of 84. But in 1994, the region dissolved into a four-year civil war between the two groups. In 1996, while Talabani turned to Iran for help, Barzani called on Saddam to send troops and help him capture Erbil from the PUK. Though the KDP and the PUK have since joined forces to dominate the region, signing a peace agreement in the US in 1998, rivalry between the supporters of Barzani and Talabani apparently persists. Nevertheless, the KDP and PUK have run in national elections as a unified Kurdish Alliance (KA). In 2005, they won 53 seats to be the second largest bloc after the Shia-dominated United Iraqi Alliance in the Iraqi parliament.

Following the defeat of the Iraqi army at hands of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) group in Iraq, Barzani was one of the people who led the Kurdish armed forces to fill the power gap left behind. The Kurdish forces, better known as the Peshmerga , whose name translates to "those who are ready to face death", and trained by US and other Western troops, proved to be formidable foes and paved the way for the defeat of ISIL, also known as ISIS. {articleGUID} Barzani was nominated in 2014 by TIME Magazine as one of the "People of the Year", citing his continued struggle for independence and his leadership in the fight against ISIL . In 2016, Barzani said: "The day we have an independent Kurdistan, I will cease to be the president of that Kurdistan." A year later, in 2017, following the defeat of ISIL in Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, Iraqi Kurds made a push for complete independence. A non-binding referendum was held about secession from Baghdad. Along with Iraq's central government, Turkey , the US, Iran and the UN all spoke out against the poll, saying it would only distract from the ongoing fight against ISIL and further destabilise the region. About 93 percent of the people who voted were in favour of Kurdish secession. Following the result, tensions in Iraq's Kurdish region rose, pitting Kurdish Peshmerga forces against the Iraqi army and allied Shia paramlitaries. Several weeks after the referendum, with pressure mounting on him to resign, Barzani announced he would end his presidency, a post he had held for 12 years. His tenure had officially expired in August 2015. SOURCE: Al Jazeera Politics US & Canada Iraq Kuwait Turkey
People celebrate to show their support for the upcoming September 25 independence referendum in Kirkuk, Iraq [Reuters] Kirkuk, northern Iraq - It's lunchtime in the Iraqi city of Kirkuk and a crowded restaurant bustles with boisterous men and the loud clinking noise of cutlery and plates. Three members of the leading Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) are deep in conversation in advance of a rally in favour of independence for Iraq's Kurdish region. "Our dream is to have Kirkuk at the heart of Kurdistan," explains Hemin Abdullah, 35, originally from Kirkuk. Abdullah and his two colleagues have been travelling through the Kurdish region and the disputed areas in a bid to convince voters to say 'Yes' to the Kurdistan Regional Government's (KRG) planned referendum on independence. READ MORE: Kurdish referendum in Iraq - What and where? Iraq's disputed territories have long been a source of contention between Baghdad and the Kurds as both lay claim to them. Kirkuk, for example, survives on Baghdad's payroll yet is under Kurdish military control. Following weeks of apparent vacillation on behalf of Kurdish President Masoud Barzani and widespread international opposition to the referendum, Barzani addressed a crowd of 40,000 in Erbil on Friday and called on voters to head to the polls on Monday. "We're creating our borders," said Abdullah, donning traditional Kurdish clothing. "European countries claim they support freedom, we want our rights, nothing more," he said. A Kurdish flag hangs atop the city's ancient citadel [Sofia Barbarani/Al Jazeera] Opposite Abdullah, Fazel Mohammad Latif, 70, is adamant that the referendum will be carried out democratically and that the "Yes" vote will prevail. "We're positive we'll win because, with the Peshmerga, there has not been killing of people based on ethnicity, because their rights are preserved," said Latif in reference to Peshmerga forces taking over Kirkuk in 2014 following the Iraqi military's withdrawal in the face of an Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) attack. Yet last November both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International released damning reports alleging that Kurdish forces had "carried out a wave of attacks, demolishing the homes and driving out hundreds of Arabs from Kirkuk". "We respect diversity, we want this diversity in Kirkuk, but under the name 'Kurdistan'," he added as a gaggle of locals outside the restaurant walked down the searing afternoon road chanting slogans and waving sun-emblazoned flags. But while the Kurdish enclave celebrates with colourful rallies and seemingly endless supplies of flags, the residents of the disputed city of Kirkuk which was controversially included in the referendum, are not as easily persuaded by the Kurds' long-standing dream of independence. The oil-rich province lies outside of the official borders of the Kurd's semi-autonomous territory and is home to Kurds, Arabs, Turkmen and Christians - many of who rebuff the idea that the city could be engulfed by a nascent independent "Kurdistan". These groups also claim a historical attachment to Kirkuk, with the Kurds referring to it as the heart of a potential "Kurdistan". "Kurds, have always considered Kirkuk as a cornerstone of their cause in Iraq and have made joining Kirkuk into their semi-autonomous region a major priority," explained Khogir Wirya of the Middle East Research Institute (MERI) think-tank. "Likewise, Turkmens accord Kirkuk a similar affinity. To me, the Kirkuk issue is more of an identity struggle than an economic one," he continued. The myriad of claims on Kirkuk coupled with the upcoming referendum have led to heightened tensions among factions, an alleged increase in security forces and a nighttime curfew following the killing of a Kurdish man by a member of the Turkmen community last week. Unlike the flurry of excitement in Kurdish-majority cities like Erbil and Duhok, Kirkuk's roads are a little quieter than usual as residents take stock of the situation. Some families are weathering the possible storm in neighbouring towns and cities, while others have been collecting extra food items like flour and rice. "This could develop into a sectarian war," said Deputy Head of the Iraqi Turkmen Front (ITF) Hassan Toran, whose party is set to boycott the referendum by not voting. "I'm afraid of violence, I'm afraid of [conflict] between sects and another between the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) and the Peshmerga," said Toran in reference to Kurdish forces and the estimated 8,000-strong state-recognised armed group of predominantly Shia fighters who joined the current government in the fight against ISIL just south of the city. According to Toran, the inability of the KRG to pay the salaries of its own state employees makes breaking away from Baghdad financially suicidal and simultaneously paves the way for an increase in ISIL (also known as ISIS), attacks. "ISIL benefits from the rise in tensions," said Toran, sitting at his party's headquarters in Kirkuk. The remnants of a building seized during ISIL's flash attack in Kirkuk in October 2016. Despite this incident, Kirkuk's security situation has improved since the Kurdish Peshmerga entered the city in 2014 [Sofia Barbarani/Al Jazeera] Two of Omar Fadhil Hamoud's uncles recently travelled to Baghdad to avoid potential clashes. "People are afraid that if the referendum happens something bad will happen, they're staying indoors, saving up money," explained Hamoud, 28, from behind the counter of his mobile phone shop. The young member of the Sunni Arab al-Jabouri tribe explained that the often-busy street he works on has been largely empty since the second week of September and that his business had taken a hit because of it. "If the referendum happens what do we do if the PMF come in and fight us? Or what if the referendum succeeds and the [Kurdish] government says no more Arabs and kicks us out?" he questioned. Hamoud has stopped leaving expensive merchandise in his shop overnight and has stocked up on flour and rice as a means of precaution. Mohammad, 28, has also been stocking up on bags of flour in his home. "We only want security and safety - whether it's the PMF or the Peshmerga," says the young Turkmen lawyer. But Mohammad isn't convinced that joining the Kurds would benefit his city. "The first thing is the economy - if we go to the KRG they wouldn't provide enough salaries," he explained. Although Mohammad admits to a noticeable improvement in security following the Peshmerga's deployment to Kirkuk in 2014, he shies away from saying whether he will vote on Monday or not. READ MORE: The looming question of Kurdish independence in Iraq One shopkeeper from ISIL-held Hawija was vocal about his unease as he discussed the upcoming referendum in an overcrowded bazaar. "You see all the flags they have distributed? It's not a comfortable situation. We're displaced from Hawija and we're worried there could be conflict," he admitted. In front of him, two Kurdish men eavesdropped eerily into the conversation: "The situation is fine, why are you saying that?" one of them asked. In a small shop at the feet of the Kurdish flag-clad citadel, a young Arab man says he is worried about what his fellow Kurds might do next. "We're brothers, and the most important thing is to do things rationally. I don't care if they take Kirkuk, as long as it's done in a peaceful way," said 25-year-old Mustafa Mohammad. Like most Iraqis, Kirkuk's residents are largely adamant that there are no existing hostilities between the various communities, but that the problem lies within the political elite. Yet as the referendum nears and tensions rise, some parts of Kirkuk's complex social fabric could begin to fray. Miqdad Faidhullah, a Kurdish member of the Iraqi Islamic Party, thinks the referendum should be postponed to avoid a potential military conflict [Sofia Barbarani/Al Jazeera] "Arabs will be able to vote freely but they will vote with fear," said Miqdad Faidhulla, a member of the Iraqi Islamic Party responsible for the Kirkuk offices. Faidhulla, a Kurd from Kirkuk, says the referendum should only be carried out in a constitutional and legal manner. "I would like to have a country but not a country with bloodshed," said Faidhulla. "If you build a country with bloodshed, it will not be stable and you will not have economic development." SOURCE: Al Jazeera ABOUT THE AUTHOR Sofia Barbarani Kurds Middle East Politics Iraq

Finding a "no" voter, or someone who will boycott the vote altogether is near impossible in the Kurdish region's capital of Erbil, controlled by President Masoud Barzani 's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).

Much of the Iraqi-Kurdish minority's animosity stems back to an "Arabisation" campaign led by late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's Baathist government, which aimed to shift the demographics in favour of the country's Sunni population. As a result, the decades-long campaign displaced hundreds of thousands of minorities, including Kurds , Turkmen, Christians and Yazidis. International rights groups including US-based Human Rights Watch classified the Anfal campaign – an operation launched in the late 1980s against the Kurds in Iraq's north - as a " genocide " for the use of chemical weapons . Some 4,000 villages in the Kurdish region were destroyed, and up to 100,000 civilians were killed. "September 25 is a historic day for all the people of the 'Kurdistan' region," Baxtiyar Goran, a 25-year-old Erbil-based journalist, told Al Jazeera. "An independent Kurdistan would put an end to all the catastrophes, opening the door for the people of Kurdistan to build up their own country and shine as a beacon of democracy and stability in a volatile Middle East," Goran, who plans to vote in favour of independence, added. "The result of living in Iraq has only been genocide, chemical bombardment, displacement, and the destruction of our homes, villages and towns." 'Yes' voter Baxtiyar Goran holds a 'Kurdistan' flag outside the White House building in Washington, DC [Baxtiyar Goran/Al Jazeera] But not all Kurds are in agreement with the likes of Goran. In the region's second-largest city of Sulaymaniyah, opinions on the referendum vary. "I'm voting 'no'," 28-year-old Dilshad Abdul, a Kurdish government employee, told Al Jazeera. READ MORE: Iraq parliament votes to remove Kirkuk governor According to Abdul, the conditions for a referendum must include political and economic stability. He says that the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG), which is embroiled in such crises that have crippled the region, must resolve these issues before a fair referendum takes place. "We still don't have a united administration," Abdul continued, referencing the KDP-controlled Erbil and Duhok governorates and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) controlled Sulaymaniyah and Halabja. Dilshad Abdul, 28, says he will vote 'No' as he believes the conditions are not right for independence [Halwest Abdulkareem/Al Jazeera] The long-time rivalry between the KDP and PUK, which saw both Kurdish parties face-off against each other on opposite sides of the Iraqi-Kurdish civil war, has seen some scepticism from voters in PUK-controlled Sulaymaniyah over the intentions of the largely KDP-led referendum process. The three-year civil war, which began in 1994, resulted in both parties controlling different areas of the Iraqi Kurdish region. Like Abdul, a number of voters in PUK controlled areas see the referendum process as undemocratic, carried out without the backing of the KRG Parliament. For the first time in two years, the legislative body convened on September 15, officially supporting the referendum and its scheduled date. The institution has been in recess since a parliament speaker, who is a member of the Sulaymaniyah-based political party Movement for Change, was refused entry to the region's capital by KDP-affiliated security forces in 2015. PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Although more than 60 members of parliament called on the parliament meeting to approve the referendum date, the Gorran Movement, which is the second largest party in the parliament, and the Kurdistan Islamic Group, have yet to join other political parties and officially endorse the referendum. Instead, both parties have been lobbying for the reactivation of parliament, and for political factions to resolve internal disputes, before such a vote takes place. A joint statement by both groups released this week reaffirmed the belief that while self-determination was a natural right of the Kurdish people, holding the referendum under the current political conditions and without solving internal crises in the KRG is a "dangerous step" to take. The debate that has sprung up in Kurdish society has not merely revolved around which way to vote, or around whether the vote should take place altogether. The debate has also included a discussion about the inclusion of the disputed territories - such as the oil-rich province of Kirkuk and parts of the Nineveh and Diyala provinces. These are controlled by the Kurdish military and lie outside of KRG's defined borders, but are regarded by Kurdish leaders as integral parts of any independent Kurdish state. The inclusion of Kirkuk, in particular, has incensed Turkmen in the ethnically mixed region, who dubbed the decision of partaking in the upcoming vote " unconstitutional ". Kirkuk, regarded as part of the state of Iraq by Baghdad, and part of the autonomous Kurdish region by the KRG, officially announced its participation in the referendum last month . Similarly, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and other government officials have repeatedly said that the referendum would violate the Iraqi constitution. "We will not allow the partition of Iraq," Abadi said. READ MORE: The looming question of Kurdish independence in Iraq The potential of an independent "Kurdistan" is also perceived as a threat by neighbouring Turkey and Iran , who fear that an independent state will influence their own Kurdish populations. Meanwhile, the United States and the European Union have both advocated for the postponement of the vote, fearing the referendum could distract from the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) by rising tensions between the Kurds, Turkmen, and Arabs. International Crisis Group's Iraq senior analyst, Maria Fantappie, told Al Jazeera that the referendum was already creating uncertainty in Iraq and that the power struggle afterwards would determine what effect the vote would ultimately have on the region. "It's [the referendum] impact on Iraq will depend less on its turnout and results, and more on how Kurds and Iraqis will react to the vote and manipulate its results to achieve their political aims in the power struggle unfolding after the defeat of [ISIL]," Fantappe said. Those who will vote in favour of independence say they are well aware of the problems that exist within the region and around the referendum. However, with the Kurdish region on the international radar following the Peshmerga 's contribution in the fight against ISIL, "Yes" voters say the time is right for a separation from Iraq. "We all admit that not everything is perfect, but waiting for the right time where everything is perfect would be too risky, and we might never have another opportunity where we can freely practise our rights and determine our future," said Goran. While an overwhelming majority of social media users utilised platforms to voice their support for independence, a countermovement led by a group of activists, entrepreneurs, and politicians in the region advocated for a postponement of the referendum under the slogan of "No for Now". PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Still, the countermovement did not succeed in convincing voters like Najwa Abbasi to vote in opposition to independence. "If we go back 100 years, Iraq has tried to debilitate civil Kurdish [society]," Abbasi said from her hometown of Sulaymaniyah. "I know they [voters who are voting in opposition to independence] are hesitant and I want to tell them - look back at what they did to us, we are the owners of our land. Every Kurdish house has lost a member in war," she added. Monday's referendum is neither binding nor the first. In 2005, a similar referendum held by Kurdish parties revealed a desire for independence. However, Kurds have become far more divided since the 2005 ballot, with the region engulfed in a financial crisis that has been blamed by some Kurds on the war against, as well as political mismanagement and corruption. Barzani's continued presidency term, which had expired in 2013, has also driven a wedge between civilians in the KDP and PUK-controlled areas, with some voters saying that they see the referendum process as a hijacking of the Kurdish independence movement - which almost all Kurds support - by Barzani. Rebaz Jaza Abdul Qadir, a university student from Sulaymaniyah, said he would boycott the vote altogether because of his views on Barzani. "Holding the referendum is an agenda which has been put forward by Barzani's family in an effort to postpone presidential elections and extend Barzani's illegal presidential term," the 24-year-old told Al Jazeera. University student Rebaz Qadir says he will boycott the referendum, which he believes is part of an 'agenda' [Halwest Abdulkareem/Al Jazeera] Qadir said he believed the referendum was also being used to obscure failures in governing the region committed by both the KDP-led Barzani family, and the PUK-led Talabani family. "New political unrest will occur among the parties after the referendum, I hope it won't reach civil war," Qadir added. While it is expected that the vote in favour of independence would ultimately win, Kurds on both sides agree that for the referendum to be a success - regardless of what side tops the ballot - internal disputes have to be resolved and potential instability staved off in its aftermath. The Kurdish region, made up of three governorates - Erbil, Dohuk and Sulaymaniyah - has enjoyed broad autonomy since the 1991 Gulf War, and has since then expanded their territory by 40 percent. It has been seeking independence since the conclusion of the first world war. Additional reporting by Hawbash Abu Bakir.

Since Fallujah was retaken by the Iraqi army in June 2016, it has witnessed the steady return of some 300,000 people [Sofia Barbarani/ Al Jazeera] Fallujah, Iraq - Ibrahim recalls the anguished face of the patient who walked into his pharmacy, seeking anticoagulants to treat a blood clot that had formed in his brain. "[He] begged me for the medicine, but I didn't have it because the checkpoint was closed," said Ibrahim, who spoke to Al Jazeera under a pseudonym for fear of repercussions. "It was so hard. I saw him crying as he left." Access into and out of the Iraqi city of Fallujah through al-Suqoor checkpoint has been a major source of delays and frustration for local residents. Al-Suqoor straddles the main highway between Fallujah and Baghdad. Vehicles wait on the long, dusty road in hopes that Iraqi forces will let them through - but these hopes are often in vain. Residents of the Sunni-majority city say that they are frequently discriminated against by forces working for Iraq's Shia government, in addition to the Shia militias aiding them. Ibrahim, who has been a pharmacist for 16 years, said that the stringent screening at al-Suqoor checkpoint has become his primary obstacle in transporting medication from Baghdad to Fallujah. Swift access to the city is essential to keep costly medications from spoiling in the summer heat. "Some medicine needs to be transported in coolers, so it's difficult to keep it cool [if the vehicles are waiting] at the checkpoint for one to three days," said Ibrahim, who says that he has lost some $5,000 worth of medicine due to the protracted security checks. Other business owners told Al Jazeera that they had also been held up for days by the security checks. The dire financial situation in Iraq is forcing some residents to prioritise food over medications [Sofia Barbarani/Al Jazeera] At the same time, there is an increase in demand for essential medicines, said Altaf Musani, the Iraq representative with the World Health Organization - partly because residents living under the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) had limited access to medical facilities. "As they've come out [of ISIL-held areas] and services have become available, people have been seeking medical care. There are also increased health conditions ... There's an overload," Musani told Al Jazeera. Doctors and patients are not the only ones suffering: Butchers in Fallujah's main bazaar complain that they are unable to transport as many sheep from Baghdad to Fallujah as they have in the past, unless they bribe checkpoint security. A gold seller told Al Jazeera that he used to go to Baghdad twice a month to buy gold, but now he only goes once every two months. Since Fallujah was retaken by the Iraqi army in June 2016, it has witnessed the steady return of some 300,000 people. But more than two years of ISIL occupation, coupled with structural damage by government shelling , has severely damaged its key infrastructure. The United Nations has been working to rebuild the main hospital, but it is still only operating at around 30 percent of its capacity, with some floors inaccessible. "It's a big burden on the hospital, [because] facilities are growing slower than the amount of population coming back," said the hospital's director-general, Ahmed Abd Jubbar. While Jubbar acknowledged that the hospital suffers from a shortage of medical tools and medications, he does not blame the government: "The Ministry of Health supplies medicine. There is a shortage, but it's getting better. [The Ministry] is trying to do its job," he told Al Jazeera. But in a separate wing of the visibly damaged hospital, a 39-year-old surgeon, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that government "security checks" have contributed to a stark shortage of drugs. Doctors at private clinics cited similar concerns, raising doubts over the health ministry's claims of supply shortages and blaming checkpoint administrators for exacerbating the region's health crisis.

(1:13) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Asmaa Usama al-Ani, the head of the Anbar Provincial Council's health committee, said that her group has been in direct contact with the health ministry to enable a faster delivery of drugs to Fallujah and Anbar. "It's our biggest problem in the province," she said of the checkpoint. "There are only two drivers with authorisation to go in and out of Anbar [with medications]. Yesterday, it took them seven hours to get to Fallujah. This has happened as a result of sectarian issues. Anbar is the biggest Sunni province and the government thinks it's a source of terrorism; that's why they punish the province." Al Jazeera was unable to reach an official with Iraq's defence ministry for comment by the time of publication. For now, neither the liberation from ISIL nor an array of UN-funded projects - including the reconstruction of damaged buildings and the rehabilitation of water and electricity - has lessened the sense of claustrophobia in Fallujah. Qassim Mohammad's 70-year-old father suffers from kidney failure, a condition that can become fatal if left untreated. Mohammad says that he spends upwards of $1,000 a month on his father, including on transport from the neighbouring town of Khalidiya, medication and dialysis. The local hospital has been unable to provide his father with state-subsidised medicine, Mohammad says, but travelling to Baghdad for the required care is not an option. "My father can't handle waiting for two hours at the checkpoint," he said, standing next to his ashen-faced father. "Day after day, the checkpoints are getting harder to pass."

A group of environmentalists recently traversed Lake Dukan as part of an awareness-raising initiative [Nabil Musa/Al Jazeera] Taqtaq, Iraq - Along the Little Zab River that cuts through the Iraqi town of Taqtaq, families picnicked on a recent weekday afternoon. Children frolicked in stalls over looking the tributary, while a pair of boats gently bobbed in the rushing current. This spot is popular among Kurds , and hints of pollution cling to the water's edge: soapy runoff, paper wrappers, metallic muck, strips of fabric. Little Zab is part of a complex network of waterways that feed Iraq's Kurdish region and, by extension, the entire country. What first passes through the semi-autonomous region to the north, eventually travels a serpentine route to connect with the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which wend their way past cities such as Mosul and Baghdad. Further south towards the Gulf is Basra and the lush waterways named by UNESCO as a heritage site . But water scarcity is becoming an increasingly pressing issue in the northern region. If neighbouring countries such as Turkey , Iran and Syria move forward with plans to repair existing dams or build new ones - such as the Daryan Dam on the Sirwan River in Iran , scheduled for completion next year - water flow to Kurdish land will be in increasing jeopardy. That timeframe could be shortened amid increased tensions with neighbouring countries in the wake of the recent independence referendum in Iraq's Kurdish region. This summer, the Kurdish agriculture minister, Abdul Sattar Majeed, blamed a sudden loss of water to the Little Zab on Iran; the shortage affected 80,000 people. Regional conflicts in both Syria and Iraq have been heavily reliant on water domination, experts note. "Control of water supplies gives strategic control over both cities and countryside ... It's life or death," Michael Stephens, a research fellow for Middle East studies at the Royal United Services Institute, told Al Jazeera. "If you control water in Iraq, you have a grip on Baghdad, and you can cause major problems." At the same time, in areas such as Taqtaq, the growing scourge of pollution is endangering waterways. Water clarity in the Tigris has declined to the point of becoming a "turbid, sediment-laden environment", according to a recent report . Sulaimania resident Nabil Musa, an environmentalist who is part of the New York-based Waterkeeper's Alliance - an advocacy group that aims to ensure "drinkable and fishable, swimmable water everywhere" - cited a pressing need to protect the fragile waterways of Iraq's Kurdish region. Security vs environment The term "waterkeeper" is used by Musa's organisation to denote someone tasked with coordinating initiatives to preserve waterways. He is the only one in Iraq, and with some help from his friends, he has been working to inform locals about the dangers of heavy metals, plastic bags, sewage and oil to their waterways. "We don't have sewage waste treatment facilities. We are just dumping all of our waste [into our drinking water]," Musa told Al Jazeera, noting that security concerns have trumped environmental issues in recent years, raising concerns about the region's longer-term future. "The Peshmerga is taking care of our borders, but who's going to protect our drinking water in the community?" Conservation efforts are under way to preserve the region's tributaries and drinking water [Kenneth R Rosen/Al Jazeera] Anna Bachmann, who founded the Waterkeepers of Iraq in 2011 and is now based in the United States , noted that Musa is just one among more than 300 waterkeepers around the world. "They're a voice for rivers and river-dependent communities ... Rivers can't really speak for themselves in terms of protecting themselves and speaking out against pollution and dams and diversions and all the threats that they face," Bachmann told Al Jazeera. "A lot of waterkeepers actually have heavy-duty litigation programmes, where they actually take polluters to court." Musa, meanwhile, has been raising awareness through videos and demonstrations about the effects of gravel mining. He has visited villages to present short videos, and he recently completed a 40km swim through Lake Dukan, west of Erbil, to raise awareness about protecting and developing it. Regarding neighbouring countries' plans for future dams, Bachmann said: " Most of these dams they want to build are completely unnecessary, highly damaging ... It's really more about controlling the water that gets to Baghdad and having something over Baghdad's head." Ahmet Saatci, the director of Turkey's State Water Works, has said that the dam construction in his country would provide a much-needed energy source. "We currently have to buy our energy from Russia and other countries, so we're trying to use our renewable energy to its fullest extent," he t old National Geographic in 2014 . The dam project is slated for completion next year, while the Tabqa dam in Syria, near Raqqa, is currently being repaired by the Red Cross. In Iraq's Kurdish region, every construction project is required by law to complete an environmental impact study - but while such legislation is progressive, putting it into practice is another story, Musa has found. Among the issues he combats regularly are: overuse of ground water in agriculture, breakdowns of irrigation systems, climate change , droughts, lower seasonal rainfalls, and salinisation from riverbed dredging and drilling. Paul Salem, the senior vice president for policy analysis, research and programmes at the Middle East Institute, noted that water insecurity in Iraq has become "an extremely critical issue". "In the past, there have been trilateral agreements about those [regional water] basins and how to manage them," he told Al Jazeera, adding that the agreements have not functioned properly in light of regional turmoil. "The [agricultural] sector is in deep crisis. Rural populations can no longer survive on agriculture and are becoming more urbanised, seeking jobs in populated regions."

Members of the Shia Popular Mobilisation Unites (PMUs) celebrate on the outskirts of Kirkuk on October 17 [Reuters/Alaa Al-Marjani] US relations with the Kurdistan Region of Iraq took a major blow in recent weeks. In the aftermath of the Kurdish referendum for independence, Iraq's security forces, alongside the Shia militias of the Popular Mobilisation Units (PMUs) launched an offensive against the Peshmerga in the disputed territory of Kirkuk, with US acquiescence. On Tuesday, these forces went as far as launching an offensive on Fish-Khabur area on the Iraq-Turkey border, where Iraqi Kurdistan's most important oil hub is located. Peshmerga forces managed to repel the attack. On Thursday there were further clashes after Baghdad deployed additional forces to the area. Highly dependent on oil for both economic and political stability, the Iraqi government naturally went after Kirkuk, a strategically vital province with estimated 9 billion barrels of oil reserves, which has been under Erbil's control since 2015. But its push to capture Fish-Khabur risks escalating the conflict into a civil war - something the US cannot afford to allow. US officials had previously warned the KRG against holding the referendum but failed to convince the Kurdish leadership that they could broker a compromise between the KRG and Baghdad over long-standing disputes. They warned that the referendum would carry risks that the US could not control. Kurdistan's leadership has expressed disappointment at what it perceives as US indifference and negligence, as the White House asserted that it was not going to take sides. For the general Kurdish public, Washington's acquiescence was a betrayal. Despite Washington's decision to back Baghdad, it still needs the KRG as an ally in Iraq and the region. Without its help, it risks losing its positions in Iraq and allowing Iran to strengthen its grip on the country. The precarious US policy in Iraq Washington's decision to back Baghdad in its dispute with Erbil was based on its strategy to help Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi consolidate power and curb Iranian influence. But by acquiescing to Baghdad's offensive on Kirkuk, the US inadvertently empowered the Iran-backed militias, which have dominated Iraq's security sphere since the 2014 collapse of the Iraqi armed forces. The PMUs are supported by large segments of the Shia community in Iraq and will almost certainly alter the political map of the country in forthcoming elections in 2018. While in their ranks there are a number of state-aligned units that do not answer to Tehran, the PMUs are led and dominated by two Tehran-linked militias: the Badr Brigade and Ketaib Hezbollah. {articleGUID} The former was established by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) in the 1980s, and the latter has been designated a "terrorist" organisation by the US. Within the PMUs, there's also Asaib Ahl al-Haq, which was established and armed by Iran and which has launched countless attacks on US military personnel since 2006. The US does not have many choices for partners in Iraq: factions within the political elite willing to work with Washington are either too weak or too insignificant. The strongest parties and factions tend to be aligned with Iran. The only strong anti-Iran faction is led by the anti-US cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. He leads the powerful Sadrist movement that has traditionally adopted a strong Iraqi nationalist discourse, but the movement is too malevolent for US purposes and is responsible for countless atrocities and attacks on American citizens. Washington has stuck to al-Abadi, who lacks a sufficiently strong popular and political base, with the hope that Iraq's military gains against ISIL will remedy his shortcomings. But this strategy is fraught with challenges and could unravel even before the elections if his rivals continue to challenge his premiership and build on their own ascendancy. Al-Abadi on his own cannot stand up to Iran, which is where the KRG comes in. If Washington is serious about wanting stability in Iraq, it has to repair its relations with the Kurds . To do that, it has to ensure the KRG has a stake in the Iraqi state and participates in the Baghdad government, despite recent events. Since 2003, no government has been formed without Kurdish participation. Baghdad has suffered a credibility and legitimacy deficit because of Arab Sunni disenfranchisement and marginalisation at the hands of the ruling Shia political class. It cannot afford to also lose the Kurds, who have generally enjoyed the role of kingmaker as a consequence of the diffuse nature of power and politics in Iraq and the resulting confessional power-sharing arrangements. {articleGUID} If there is no Kurdish engagement to bolster al-Abadi's position, hardline Iran-aligned factions will almost certainly dominate the government and consolidate their hold on state institutions. To make such an arrangement work both in the short and long-term, equitable, just and sustained power-sharing arrangements must be firmly installed within Iraq's political system. As it has done historically, the KRG provides the US with strategic depth in a country that is becoming increasingly dominated by actors hostile to its engagements and values. Abadi may not even be in office this time next year. The Kurds can bolster US influence in Iraq but only if Washington prevents continued advances from Baghdad aimed at putting the KRG under economic siege. If this happens, the situation could escalate into another civil war. The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial policy.

A man rides a bike near a mural supporting the referendum for independence of the Kurdish region in Erbil, Iraq [Alaa Al-Marjani/Reuters] The punditry world has never been as united as it is today: virtually everyone agrees that the independence referendum that was organised on 25 September in Iraqi Kurdistan was an unmitigated disaster. There is also a consensus on what factors caused Kurdistan Regional President Masoud Barzani to miscalculate so badly, so there is little point recounting those arguments here. The short-term consequences of the crisis also appear to be fairly obvious. Federal authorities, with associated paramilitary forces, will reassert its authority over most if not all of the disputed territories, strategic oil fields, and border points, including airports. Large population centres within the Kurdistan Region proper are unlikely to be directly impacted, but they will be made to feel the economic consequences of the reassertion of federal control. Meanwhile, Kurdish politics have already completely fractured, with the regional president and his party losing virtually all claim to legitimacy (having lost legal legitimacy a long time ago) while a series of actors continue blaming each other for the disaster. The real question is how Baghdad and Erbil can resolve their dispute peacefully and in a sustainable manner. A long-term resolution of the dispute between the two sides will depend on a number of factors, very few of which are likely to materialise without massive intervention from the international community, the likes of which have only rarely been successful in the past, and certainly not in Iraq . {articleGUID} Identifying a new form of federalism The first step towards resolution is for both parties to properly define their interests, which is far easier said than done. Both sides will need considerable time and effort to deflate their egos and coalesce around interests that can reasonably be satisfied. Baghdad's current sense of hubris, and the chauvinistic taunting that has been taking place on the airwaves and the halls of government increase the likelihood that the federal government will present maximalist demands. On the other hand, Erbil will have serious trouble getting used to its reduced clout after 14 years of an oversized role in Iraqi internal politics. A serious constitutional reform effort will have to follow, mainly for the purpose of identifying a new form of federalism that everyone can live with. This will have to involve a fair and transparent revenue sharing mechanism, the establishment of a fair and impartial dispute resolution mechanism that both sides can rely on, etc. That process on its own is likely to take years, and that assumes that both parties are willing to go through the exercise, which is far from certain at this point. Based on past experience, there is a serious risk that none of these objectives will be met, and that the current crisis will be allowed to simmer for years before finally boiling over once again. Since 2005, when the current constitution was adopted, Baghdad has tried and failed to revise the text on a number of occasions, including in far happier and more stable times. It has also failed to make any serious progress in establishing the institutions that it is theoretically obligated to establish by the Constitution, including the upper chamber of parliament and a whole slew of others. Moving from crisis to crisis In the current environment, left to its own devices, Baghdad will live day by day, moving from crisis to crisis, rather than seeking a major resolution of its relationship with Erbil. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) is yet to be defeated; then there will be parliamentary elections, which will be followed by the inevitable government formation crisis, which will then lead to a struggle for control over security policy and institutions. All of which means that any serious effort to resolve the crisis with Erbil will not appear on the radar for years. {articleGUID} The regional context will not help either, given how angry virtually all governments appear to be with Erbil. All of these countries will always prioritise their own personal interests and relations with Baghdad over any sympathy or sense of loyalty they might have for the Kurds . That was made extremely clear by the way in which all regional airlines cancelled their flights to the Kurdistan Region's airports at Baghdad's request after the independence referendum. Plus, a renewed anti-Kurdish chauvinism, fuelled by the Peshmerga's embarrassing retreat from Kirkuk and other areas, will certainly not help. Therefore, if there is to be a solution, it will have to come from the international community. If the United Nations and countries of goodwill wish to prevent the current seething tensions from exploding into a new conflict in the immediate or long term, they will have to invest significant resources, first to convince Baghdad that it has an interest in a long-term solution, and second to find one or several options that Baghdad, Erbil and Suleimania can live with. This will require a multi-pronged approach that will be as difficult to devise as it will be to implement. It will require deploying massive goodwill, resources, patience, imagination and determination, not all of which are in plentiful supply at the moment. While a successful outcome remains unlikely, it is not impossible, so perhaps the best approach for the rest of us is to cling to whatever hope we can muster.

The October 25 referendum has caused Kurdistan's friends to fall silent and its enemies to be encouraged, writes Abdulwahid [Alaa Al-Marjani/Reuters] Since the end of World War I, the Kurdish people have been a pawn in the hands of players in the Middle East chess game played so hard, and often so bloodily. Throughout these years, all we, the Kurds , asked for was to be given a chance. Give us the opportunity to prove we can be a trusted ally, a friend to democracy and a nation that respects all religions and peoples. We proved this time and again, when we helped end the regime of Saddam Hussein; when we decided to stay part of Iraq to help it start anew after Saddam; when we made our region a hub of investment, tranquility and religious freedom; when we joined the battle against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS). And we have waited patiently. And we have kept our end of all of the bargains, only to see others break their word. Now it is time to permit Kurds to determine their future political path. It is especially troubling that, as we arrive at this moment in history, some within the Kurdistan region have joined outsiders with self-serving intentions to use us as a pawn again against our democracy. The referendum that took place on September 25 is such a move. It was meant to use the overwhelming desire for independence that burns within almost every Kurdish heart to promote the special interests of a few, at the expense of our nascent democracy. This referendum was designed to serve the narrow political interests of President Massoud Barzani , whose term expired over two years ago and who remains in office despite calls from our democratic allies that he obeys the constitution. {articleGUID} The president's refusal to abide by the constitution - and his actions to divert attention from this power grab - is in defiance to the will of the Kurdish people. Our hopes for a peaceful transition of power are at risk, all cloaked in a nationalist smoke screen. Many Iraqi Kurds in political leadership positions see the referendum for what it is - political theatrics to reinvigorate the old crumbling political parties. That is not a path to independence for Kurdistan; it is a game of greed and abuse of power with an end game likely aiming at isolation from our neighbours and allies. The United States and other friends of the Kurds have been clear in opposing the referendum and declaring concern about Kurdish independence aspirations. We are deeply thankful to the White House's overall support of Kurdish democracy, which has come regardless of who has been president. We are also very grateful for the strong, consistent backing of many in Congress for our goal to become a reliable economic and political partner. Thus, as we go forward to explore the possibility of independence, we wish to do so in conjunction with our allies' assistance and guidance. That is why the Movement for Change - Gorran, of which I am a member - refused to join the referendum spree and demanded to debate this crucial matter in the regional parliament, the highest legal authority in the Kurdistan Region. We are a few months ahead of parliamentary elections at the federal level, with elections in the Region set for early November 2017. It should be the individuals elected in these votes who steer any course towards independence. {articleGUID} The referendum has caused Kurdistan's friends to fall silent and its enemies to be encouraged. Major regional powers, as well as the international community, have warned against a referendum and retaliation has already started. Iraq has blocked international flights. Russia has insisted that Iraq's territorial integrity must be maintained. Turkey is threatening potentially crippling restrictions on oil trade, while our budget is already under strain because of dropping oil prices and lowered production. The Kurdistan Region must be strategic about the political situation in Iraq, relations with the government in Baghdad, and external relations with the region and beyond. This is imperative. To ensure a lasting independence and a viable state, we need vibrant and clear support to build solid foundations for strong democratic institutions. The curtain needs to fall, and the theatrics need to end. The struggle for personalised power must give way to a democratic, independent Kurdistan embraced by the other nations in the world.

Iraq's Kurds face a new security crisis after the defeat of ISIL [Ahmad al-Rubaye/Getty Images] Iraq's prime minister has ordered a temporary halt to a military operation in the country's north aimed at wresting back territory held by Kurdish security forces. In a statement on Friday, Haider al-Abadi ordered government forces to suspend their operations for 24 hours to enable the deployment of other forces in coordination with Kurdish forces in the disputed areas and along the country's borders. The suspension of the movement of troops will allow a technical team from the two sides to jointly work for the deployment, al-Abadi said. "This is aimed at preventing a showdown and bloodshed between people of the same country." Al-Abadi's decision came a day after government forces and Kurdish forces clashed near the northern city of Mosul. Last week, Iraqi forces retook the oil-rich region of Kirkuk, which had been held by the Kurds since the Iraqi army fled from advancing ISIL fighters in 2014. The show of force came after the secession referendum of September 25, in which 92 percent of Kurds supported independence from Iraq , prompting tension between the two sides.

Barzani's KRG offered to suspend its drive for secession in return for a promise from Baghdad to halt its military activity [Gailan Haji/EPA] Erbil, Iraq - A closed session is underway at the Kurdistan regional parliament in response to Iraqi-Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani's decision not to extend his presidential term beyond November 1. The Kurdish leader's decision casts doubt over who will lead the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) after he leaves office. The veteran Kurdish leader and head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) initially said he would step down after Iraqi Kurds go the polls on November 1, but these elections have now been postponed by eight months, leaving it unclear what would happen to the presidency in the interim. Before Barzani addressed the closed meeting on Sunday, the head of the KDP parliamentary block, Omid Khoshnaw, said the decision was "not an official resignation according to the constitution". "Barzani asked parliament to deal with this issue of distributing his authority between the government and the parliament," Khoshnaw said, adding "(Barzani) will remain as a symbol for the Kurdish nation". {articleGUID} Rumours have been circulating for the past two weeks that Barzani, 71, would end his presidency, a post he has held for 12 years. His tenure had officially expired in August 2015. On Saturday, unnamed politicians and Kurdish media reported that Barzani had sent a letter to parliament, laying out how power should be distributed once he is no longer in office. Some in the Kurdish region believe that Barzani stepping down is of little consequence - that he will remain in the background and that the Barzani family maintains its grip there, perhaps with his nephew and current KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani taking over the interim period. Other analysts suggest that this is a small step towards giving Kurdish institutions more sway, empowering parliament that has been suspended since 2015 when a rift between Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the opposition Gorran movement resulted in it being shut down. Barzani's legacy The president only recently re-activated parliament to vote through the controversial September 25 referendum on secession, which Barzani wanted to be his legacy. In 2016, Barzani said: "The day we have an independent Kurdistan, I will cease to be the president of that Kurdistan." Barzani went ahead with the referendum against the wishes and warnings of some of his closest allies, most notably the United States. READ MORE: Barzani: Kurd region poll to occur despite opposition The referendum resulted in an overwhelming "Yes" but the backlash proved to be more surprising. Iraqi federal forces, within two days, took over large areas of the disputed territories that the Kurds had controlled for the last few years, causing them to lose oil-rich Kirkuk - the beating heart of any future Kurdish state - whose oil would have allowed the hypothetical state to fund itself. Kirkuk was among territory seized by Kurdish forces when the Iraqi military abandoned the city in the face of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) advances in 2014, but it is not within the borders of the KRG's autonomous territory. Tensions have steadily mounted between Baghdad and the KRG since the referendum, with many warning that it distracted from Iraq's ongoing fight against ISIL and further destabilised the region. Baghdad has made it clear that it would re-assert federal control over all borders the KRG currently controls - with Syria, Turkey and Iran - in line with the Iraqi constitution.

Barzani was one of the most significant driving forces behind the Kurdish bid to secede from Iraq, but pressure had been mounting on him to step aside ever since September's controversial referendum.

RenderPagesVideo('5629225548001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); The parliament of the Iraqi Kurdish region has approved a request by Masoud Barzani, the president of Iraq 's Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), not to renew his term when it expires on November 1. The approval came during a closed session on Sunday of the Iraqi Kurdistan Parliament in the regional capital, Erbil. The decision comes just over a month after a controversial secession referendum spearheaded by Barzani, which led to days of fighting between Iraqi government and Kurdish Peshmerga forces. In a letter to parliament, Barzani had said: "I, as Masoud Barzani the Peshmerga, will continue with our nation and beloved Peshmerga in endeavours to achieve the just rights of our nation and protect the achievements of our nation." Barzani, 71, has signalled that he wants to divide presidential powers between the regional government, parliament and the judiciary. However, he will remain in Kurdish politics as leader of the High Political Council, according to his senior assistant Hemin Hawrami. The KRG's High Political Council was formed to replace the High Referendum Council to take the lead in the post-referendum phase. Question of successor Barzani's decision throws the field wide open to aspirants for the KRG president's post after he vacates it. The veteran Kurdish leader and head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) initially said he would step down after Iraqi Kurds went the polls on November 1. But these elections have now been postponed by eight months, leaving it unclear what would happen to the presidency in the interim.

Iraqi federal forces, within two days, took over large areas of the disputed territories that the Kurds had controlled for the last few years, causing them to lose oil-rich Kirkuk - the beating heart of any future Kurdish state - whose oil would have allowed the hypothetical state to fund itself. Kirkuk was among territory seized by Peshmerga forces when the Iraqi military abandoned the city in the face of ISIL advances in 2014, but it is not within the borders of the KRG's autonomous territory. Tensions quickly rose between Iraqi federal government and the KRG since the referendum, with many cautioning that it distracted from Iraq's ongoing fight against ISIL , or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group, and further destabilised the region. READ MORE: Who is Masoud Barzani? The government has made it clear that it intends to reassert federal control over all borders the KRG currently controls - with Syria, Turkey and Iran - in line with the Iraqi constitution. Al Jazeera's Stefanie Dekker, reporting from Erbil after the Kurdish parliament session, said: "The [Kurds] have to have a relationship with the central government, because it is still one country. It's a semi-autonomous region [of Iraq]. "At the moment, for example, one of the [consequences] of the controversial referendum is that the federal authority in Baghdad is going to take over control of the border crossings that the KRG has been in charge of since 20013. "So talks are going on at the moment. Today was the second day of the discussions in Mosul between the Iraqis and the Peshmerga under the auspices of the international coalition against ISIL."

The attack was the first of its kind since the Iraqi central government regained control of the multi-ethnic city [Reuters] Two explosions struck the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk killing at least five people and wounding more than 20 others, local medics said. The suicide attack targeted offices of Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) on Atlas Street, located in the heart of the city, on Sunday, a ccording to local media reports . The PMF are Iranian-backed, Shia-dominated paramilitaries who have fought alongside Iraqi government forces since 2014. The attack was the first of its kind since the Iraqi central government regained control of the multi-ethnic city last month from Kurdish Peshmerga forces - who had been in control of the area for three years. {articleGUID} A controversial September 25 referendum on Kurdish secession led to mounting tensions between the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the Iraqi central government. Baghdad had declared the results of the referendum illegal. The non-binding vote led to a military confrontation between Peshmerga forces and Iraqi government forces in Kirkuk, which was previously considered among the disputed areas of the northern region. Kirkuk was among territory seized by Peshmerga forces when the Iraqi military abandoned the city in the face of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) advances in 2014, but it is not within the borders of the KRG's autonomous territory. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Sunday's attack. Baghdad has reiterated it would re-assert federal control over all borders the KRG currently controls - with Syria, Turkey, and Iran - in line with the Iraqi constitution.

ISIL fighters now only control a chunk of territory in Iraq's northwest [AP] ISIL has lost further ground in Iraq and Syria as the armies of both countries and the Syrian opposition squeeze its forces. Late on Friday, Haider al-Abadi , Iraq's prime minister, announced the recapture of al-Qaim, the group's last stronghold in Iraq . Iraqi forces took full control of the city on the Syrian border after seizing the last border crossing held by ISIL , or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group. They have been getting help from Sunni tribal fighters and the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), a Shia paramilitary force. Just five months ago, ISIL still controlled vast expanses of territory, including major cities, on both sides of the Iraq-Syria border. Since then, it has been driven out of Mosul in Iraq and its self-declared capital Raqqa and Deir Az Zor in Syria. The fighters now only control a chunk of territory in Iraq's northwest, along the Syrian border. Earlier on Friday, Syria's army said it was in control of Deir Az Zor, the capital of an oil-rich eponymous region that was crucial for ISIL's finances. The campaign to retake the eastern city began in September when government forces managed to break the three-year siege of the eastern Syrian city by ISIL. Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting on Friday from Gaziantep on the Turkey-Syria border , said Syrian forces will most probably find a city destroyed by months of air raids and intense fighting. "This is a significant development in that it paves the way for the Syrian army to start expanding further in the eastern part of the country," he said.

Iraq's Kurds are trying to hold on to a border crossing connecting their region to Kurdish areas in Syria [Chris McGrath/Getty Images] For the best part of a week now, talks have been on going between Baghdad and Erbil, with the presence of the international coalition, to figure out how to apply the former's demands. They include the re-deployment of federal forces in all of the disputed territories, which has already largely happened, and the more complicated issue of handing over of border crossings that the (Kurdistan Regional Government) KRG has administered since 2003. In the late hours of Wednesday night, a strongly worded statement was issued by Iraq's joint operations command. {articleGUID} Baghdad accused Erbil of backtracking on its commitments and returning to square one. It also accused Peshmerga forces of building new defences and blocking the deployment of federal troops. The KRG's ministry of Peshmerga responded a few hours later "condemning in the strongest terms baseless statement by Iraq's joint operations command". The Kurds do not want to give up the borders they control. Two of them are hot topics at the moment, Ibrahim Khalil, which is the crossing with Turkey and Feysh Khabur, the border crossing with Syria. In their statement, the Kurds spelt out their demands for Feysh Khabur: Deploying a joint force of Peshmerga, the Iraqi army and representatives of the US-led global coalition. But Baghdad has made it clear that only federal forces will administer these crossings, as is the case with the disputed territories. The Kurds want joint forces deployed there until the Iraqi constitution is implemented, meaning a referendum needs to be called. Baghdad has stated clearly, only federal forces will be present in those territories. A Peshmerga fighters is seen at a frontline position outside the town of Altun Kubri, Iraq [Chris McGrath/Getty Images] 'We simply take orders' It is hugely complicated, and the biggest reversal in fortunes for the Kurds in years. It also doesn't seem to be about finding a middle ground, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has said that these are not negotiations, these are talks in order to prevent the bloodshed of innocent Iraqis. That Baghdad will re-assert federal authority over all borders, including international flights, is a fact. Al Jazeera has been told by many Kurds that they fear Baghdad is taking away the autonomy they enjoyed for years. The many Peshmerga we ask initially have a similar response: "We are military men and we simply take orders." But sit with them off camera, and talk about what's going on, and you start to scratch the surface of their real emotions. They feel betrayed by the coalition, especially the Americans. They complain that the Hashd al-Shabi, or Shia militias are the ones spearheading the fight, with weapons that the US gave them to fight ISIL. We met one commander on Thursday morning. He tells us militias sent a whole battalion with heavy weaponry to Zummar on Wednesday night, this is around 30km south of Feysh Khabour. {articleGUID} We have no way of verifying that, but he says their intentions are clear. They want to control the Feysh Khabour border crossing in order to cut the link between the Kurds in Iraq, and the Kurds in what they call Rojava, in Syria. It's an interest in line with Turkey, and Iran. "If they force you to leave your house" he says, "surely you would fight to defend it?". Al Jazeera asks him whether he thinks this will be resolved through the gun, or though dialogue. He paused for a moment. His men sit around him, listening as we talk. These are proud men - battle hardened and practical. "In the end," he tells us, "for all the fighting that has happened, and could still happen - it always ends up at the political table to be resolved."

The attempt to gain greater autonomy is aimed at establishing new governing institutions to shore up regional sovereignty [File: Al Jazeera] Kurdish local elections in northern Syria are likely to succeed despite potential opposition from the central government, analysts say. Organised by Kurdish authorities, the vote on Friday to elect local council representatives is the second part of a three-phase process that began in September, when voters elected leaders for about 3,700 "communes". The attempt to gain greater autonomy is aimed at establishing new governing institutions to shore up regional sovereignty. The final phase will conclude in January with an election for an assembly that would act as a parliament for a federal system of government, as part of a decentralised Syria. Although the central government in Damascus opposes the ambitions of Kurdish groups, Aron Lund, a Syria expert and Century Foundation fellow, said there is no imminent threat facing the country's Kurds . "They have already created institutions, and there's nothing to stop them from developing these further," Lund told Al Jazeera. Creating a viable and lasting economy is the actual challenge, he said. {articleGUID} "Kurdish-controlled northeastern Syria has a lot of profitable resources in the form of oil and agriculture, but it will remain dependent on Damascus for many financial and infrastructural needs and for access to the outside world," Lund said. Kurdish groups had established autonomous rule since 2011, when Syria's civil war began, and have reiterated their wishes to steer away from the example of northern Iraq. Walid Muallem, the country's foreign minister, said in September that Syria is open to discussing the idea of granting the Kurds more power once the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) ends. But whether Damascus and the Kurds would be able to come to an agreement depends on various factors, including American, Turkish and Russian policies, and how each side "decides to use its leverage over the other", Lund said. "Officials in Damascus are totally intransigent on the issue of state sovereignty over all of Syria, but obviously that's more of an ambition than a realistic prospect at this point in time … Whatever flexibility they advertise now might disappear quickly if the post-Islamic State period sees a shift in the balance of power," he said. Reservations persist The political structures expected to emerge from this process are inspired by the ideas of Abdullah Ocalan, head of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ), who is in jail in Turkey for leading a three-decade rebellion. Turkey labels the PKK as "terrorists" and views the political rise of Syria's Kurds as a threat to its national security. It has been engaged in an armed conflict with the PKK for decades, mainly in the country's south. Whether the Kurds in Syria will succeed in forming a viable parliament also depends on other Kurdish parties that have reservations about the new system established by the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) and its allies. This includes the PYD's main rival party, the Kurdish National Council - a coalition of smaller parties that advocates for a more integrated approach. Kurds in Syria accounted for 15 percent of the country's population before the civil war, which has killed around 465,000 people and displaced more than 12 million. The dominant Syrian Kurdish political groups say their system is a multi-ethnic one that is inclusive of all ethnic and religious groups in the region. {articleGUID} During the early years of the civil war, ISIL fighters gained a foothold in Raqqa. The YPG, the armed wing of the PYD, worked with other forces on the ground to regain large swaths of land from ISIL. Tensions have mounted between the YPG and the Syrian regime and allied forces as the battle has pushed towards Deir Az Zor province. But if the Kurds succeed in gaining greater autonomy, analysts say, it is unlikely that they will face military resistance from the Syrian regime. "[The YPG is] organisationally and operationally more effective than the Peshmerga of Iraqi Kurdistan," who were defeated last month by Iraqi forces in the disputed city of Kirkuk, said Ranj Alaaldin, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institute in Qatar's capital, Doha. "Its battle-hardened fighters have been engaged in intense conflict for more than six years … and will be better positioned to stave off external challenges to its authority." The YPG currently has a relationship of interdependency with the Syrian regime and international powers, including the United States and Russia , making them an "indispensable ally" to the regime, Alaaldin said. The Iraq model In neighbouring Iraq , a bid for Kurdish independence in the north has spurred an escalating dispute after a controversial September referendum on Kurdish secession, which Baghdad declared illegal. The non-binding vote led to a military confrontation between Kurdish Peshmerga forces and Iraqi government forces in the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, which was ultimately retaken by Iraqi forces. Although Syria's Kurds do not want a model similar to that of their Iraqi counterparts, the Syrian government "might feel emboldened more to take harsh positions after they saw the US not doing much when Iraqi forces took over the disputed territories" in Iraq, said Wladimir van Wilgenburg, an expert on Kurdish politics in Syria. Since Damascus is not an ally to Washington, the US would more likely side with the Kurds in Syria, Wilgenburg told Al Jazeera. Meanwhile, in an effort to diminish its involvement in Syria's civil war, Russia has been facilitating talks between the Kurds and the regime. An Assad-Kurd alignment would be a "quick way" to resolve one aspect of the Syrian conflict and help to revive the country's shattered economy, Lund said. While it is unclear how the next phase of the elections will pan out, analysts say the only way that a Syrian Kurdish autonomy could last would be if the US supports their bid for some form of federal governance - a move that would require a "shift in American policy". "So far, the United States has shown little interest in spending the time and resources necessary to build up a Kurdish region that could stand on its own apart from Damascus," Lund said.

Younger generations if Travellers have little interest in traditional crafts [Ruairi Casey/Al Jazeera] Avila Park, Dublin, Ireland - In a wooden shed in his back garden, James Collins sits on a low stool hammering out the final touches on a billy can. At 68, he is one of only two remaining traveller tinsmiths in Ireland. Above the clutter of well-worn tools and scrap sheet metal hang a dozen or so other cans. Nowadays, he says, there's precious little demand for his trade, and he largely continues it as a hobby, occasionally selling some of his work at vintage craft fairs. Since the introduction of plastic homeware in the 1960s and 1970s, tinsmithing - traditionally dominated by the historically nomadic community known as Travellers - has effectively died out. Even the block tin, James originally used, is no longer available. "It's more difficult to work with," he says, holding up a gleaming aluminium can. "You can't make what you want to make out of it because you have to use solder and that won't take solder." READ MORE: Ballinasloe Horse Fair - An ancient Irish tradition James was raised on the road in the Irish midlands, a traditional upbringing unknown to most Travellers today. "I was bred, born and reared on the road," he says, "but the young lads today wasn't. They all grew up in houses and went to school and all this craic. I never got any education, never went to school in my life." Until his late 20s, when he settled in Avila Park, a housing estate for Travellers on the outskirts of Dublin, the Irish capital, James plied his trade for farmers, smithing and repairing buckets. "It never goes out of your mind; you're always thinking, thinking the whole time about the road," he says. In comparison, younger generations have little interest in traditional crafts or the travelling lifestyle - James' children and grandchildren don't know how to harness a horse, for example. And anti-trespass legislation introduced in the early 2000s, which was used to disperse encampments by the side of roads or on council-owned land, made a nomadic existence increasingly difficult. Yet, even as the distinct traditions of Irish Travellers seem to fade into the past, the battle for official recognition of their identity continues. Avila Park is a housing estate for Travellers on the outskirts of Dublin [Ruairi Casey/Al Jazeera] The search for recognition Unlike the United Nations and the United Kingdom, Ireland does not recognise Travellers as a separate ethnicity from the non-Traveller community. For decades, human rights organisations and Traveller advocacy groups have been seeking this recognition, but to little avail. However, on January 26, a parliamentary committee established to investigate the issue stated unequivocally that "Travellers are, de facto, a separate ethnic group". "This is not a gift to be bestowed upon them, but a fact the state ought to formally acknowledge," it further said. The committee report urged the Taoiseach, Ireland's prime minister, or the minister for justice to give a statement to the Dail, the Irish parliament, acknowledging this at the earliest opportunity. This development was welcomed by members of the Travelling community, although some remain cautious in their optimism. It would not be the first time an Irish government has reneged on such commitments - a 2014 parliamentary report made the same recommendation, which was never acted upon. A history of deprivation and discrimination An examination of the almost 30,000 Travellers in the Republic of Ireland shows a staggering level of deprivation completely at odds with the non-Traveller community. Another 4,000 to 5,000 Travellers live in Northern Ireland, in a similar situation. Around half of Travellers have no secondary education and only 1 percent have attended university, according to Pavee Point, a group fighting for the rights of Travellers. WATCH: Irish travellers facing discrimination Some 84 percent of Travellers are unemployed, while suicide rates are almost seven times higher than among settled people. A 2010 study found that life expectancy was 15 years lower among men and 11 years lower among women when compared with their settled counterparts. Discrimination against Travellers remains endemic at social and institutional levels. Being denied entry to businesses is a common occurrence and many try to hide their background when applying for jobs, fearing that potential employers will not hire them. "Symbolically it would have a profound impact on our collective sense of identity, self-esteem and confidence as a people," says Martin Collins, the co-director of Pavee Point, on the recognition of Traveller ethnicity. "Some travellers have internalised [racism] and end up believing that they are of no value, they are of no worth ... So that's the impact. That's the outcome of both racism and your identity being denied." A culture denied It was a 1963 government report, the Commission on Itinerancy, that has set the tone for the state's attitude towards Travellers ever since, says Sinn Fein Senator Padraig MacLochlainn, the first person from a Traveller background to be elected to the Irish parliament. Traveller rights groups have been seeking recognition for their community [Ruairi Casey/Al Jazeera] The Committee on Itinerancy 's terms of reference defined Travellers as a "problem", whose social ills were "inherent in their way of life," and outlined the goal of "promot[ing] their absorption into the general community". No Travellers were on the committee, nor were they consulted for its report. "Our people and our state denied their history and decided that they were criminals and they needed to be immersed in with the rest of us," says MacLochlainn. This refusal to acknowledge the community's rich cultural history - notably their own language, Cant, and significant contributions to Irish traditional music - persists today. Traveller culture is frequently portrayed in the media as separate and distinct, MacLochlainn says, but almost always in negative terms, in exploitation TV shows such as My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding and exposes on Traveller criminality. "You clearly accept them as a distinct group - why are you making these programmes if you don't? If they're a distinct group, could you do it now in positive terms? "When it comes to negative characterisations, the media, the establishment ... in Ireland are more than happy for them to be characterised in negative terms," the senator says. Behind James' shed in Avila Park, traditional and modern Traveller accommodation sit side by side. A wooden barreltop caravan, washed green with blue and red embellishments, sits between two mobile home units, where his younger relatives stay. Only one has both electricity and running water, which were installed by the family. Power is provided from the house by a yellow cable, wound loosely around plastic drainpipes and holes in its pebbledash exterior. An early morning fire in a nearby prefabricated unit just a few weeks before offered a bleak reminder of the danger these makeshift electrical fixtures pose. A neighbour raised the alarm and the young couple inside escaped before their home was reduced to a charred husk. Children burned to death This near disaster has reminded some people of a fire in the south Dublin suburb of Carrickmines more than a year ago, which continues to cast a shadow over relations between the Traveller and the settled communities. In the early hours of October 10, 2015, a fire ripped through a halting site killing 10 people, including five children, from two families - the Lynch and Gilbert family and the Connors. The youngest victim was five months old. It was one of the deadliest fires in the history of the Republic of Ireland. Social workers had raised concerns about the site's substandard prefabricated units to authorities in the months before the fire, but no action was taken. The blaze and its aftermath would, for many, become an example of the pervasive discrimination Travellers face in Ireland today. Three days after the fire, some locals blockaded land marked for temporary accommodation for the surviving members of the Connors family, preventing construction vehicles from entering. Though the obstruction was condemned by then Environment Minister Alan Kelly and several Traveller groups, the protesters were successful. OPINION: Catholic Ireland's saints and sinners On October 21, one day before the last victims were buried, the county council announced that the Connors family would instead be resettled on a reclaimed dump on council land in a nearby suburb. At the time of writing, the family remain in that location. Alongside many expressions of grief on social media after the fire were comments highlighting the discrimination towards travellers in Irish society. On one popular news site, a comment simply wishing that the victims rest in peace received hundreds of thumbs down votes from other readers. "Hundreds of Irish people gave a thumbs down to an expression of sympathy for children who were burned to death," says MacLochlainn. "That's terrifying; that's absolutely terrifying." In response to the tragedy, local authorities across the country conducted fire safety audits at Traveller accommodation sites. "All we got was a few fire alarms, a few fire blankets and some carbon monoxide alarms," says Collins, of Pavee Point. "That's like re-arranging the chairs on the Titanic. That's totally inadequate. These sites need to be completely redeveloped [and] refurbished, because the sites are just inherently dangerous. Getting a few fire alarms and a few hoses will not rectify the situation." For Collins, the long overdue recognition of Traveller ethnicity is an important milestone, but as the Carrickmines example shows, a commitment to materially improving the lives of Travellers is also necessary if they are to be truly equal in their own country. Traveller culture is frequently portrayed negatively in the media [Ruairi Casey/Al Jazeera] SOURCE: Al Jazeera News ABOUT THE AUTHOR Ruairi Casey Europe Ireland
Protesters in Dublin yesterday chanted 'Get your rosaries off our ovaries' and 'This is what democracy looks like'. Many in Ireland want a referendum on the abortion law [Barbara McCarthy] Correction, March 10, 2017: : An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the 1983 amendment allows for abortions if the woman’s life is in immediate danger and that abortions can legally take place in cases of rape, incest, or ill health of the mother. The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 allows for abortions only if a woman’s life is immediately threatened. The article has been updated to include the 2013 act and clarify the legislative circumstances under which abortions can take place. Thousands of people across Ireland went on strike yesterday in solidarity with women who are forced to travel to the UK to access abortions which are banned in their own country. Strike4Repeal campaigners marched in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Kilkenny as well as around the UK, and in New York, Melbourne and Buenos Aires, to demand the Irish government hold a constitutional referendum on Ireland's eighth amendment - which places the right to life of an unborn child on equal footing with that of the mother. Organisers asked citizens to take the day off work, forgo domestic chores where possible, wear black in solidarity, register support on social media and ask local businesses to close their services. "Thousands of people took time off work last year to access abortions - we are asking you to show your solidarity with them," said a video message by Strike4Repeal, which a sked people to strike if a referendum was not held by March 8. In an act of resistance, demonstrators chanted "Get your rosaries off our ovaries" and "This is what democracy looks like" as they halted traffic in the hope that the Irish government would hear their voices. The eighth amendment, which was passed in 1983, recognised the right to life of the unborn child, effectively introducing a ban on abortion. The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 allows for abortions only if the woman's life is immediately threatened, including by suicide. Al Jazeera joined women and men on the streets of Dublin to get their thoughts on abortion rights in Ireland. Larissa Nolan [Barbara McCarthy/Al Jazeera] Larissa Nolan, 40, is a journalist who describes her political views as libertarian. She lives in Dublin with her son. "I'm pro-life and in Ireland if you say that openly, you're a social pariah. The so-called pro-choice movement has become increasingly militant and intolerant of views which are different to theirs. I'm at the march today as an exercise in social observation. I'm curious to see if people at the march understand fully what they are marching for. This campaign has become a bandwagon, which is forcing a one-sided ideology down people's throats and now they want people to stop work to force the government into ceding to their demands. I don't believe in telling a woman what to do either way. Give them the facts, be non-judgmental and let them figure it out. I'm quite outspoken about being pro-life, but other women - and there are lots of them - feel they are better off keeping their thoughts to themselves for fear of being attacked. But I fear come referendum day, they will let their votes do the talking. I think the movement could see a shock result like Brexit or Trump . I don't think abortions are a black and white issue. By their very nature, abortions require quick decision-making and the repeal movement has absolutely no time for the psychological consequences a woman can suffer after making what could be the wrong decision." Helen Guinane [Barbara McCarthy/Al Jazeera] Helen Guinane is a 38-year-old mother of two who works in IT. She is part of the group Parents for Choice which marched with the Strike4Repealers. "What people don't know is that 54 percent of abortions accessed in the UK are by people who are already parents. People think abortions are exclusive to people in their 20s, but they're not. Parents access abortions for a number of reasons - either they already have a family and can't afford more children or had a situation where contraception didn't work, are lone parents, or victims of abuse. There are endless situations why people have to terminate a pregnancy and whatever people decide, it should be their choice and not that of the government. I genuinely think that if we have abortions in Ireland, people will be able to make a more measured decision. The fear and anxiety women have about travelling consumes their decisions. If they know they can have abortions in their own country, they can actually focus on the issue a lot more." READ MORE: The long road towards acceptance for Irish travellers [Barbara McCarthy/Al Jazeera] Bernadette Goulding is a co-ordinator at Rachel's Vineyard, which offers support and weekend retreats for women and men suffering from post-abortion trauma. She spoke to Al Jazeera from Cork. "The pro-abortion lobby never talk about it - the grief and trauma women and men can suffer after having an abortion. My retreats are always booked up. People think an abortion [is] just a temporary thing, but it can affect you for the rest of your life. I have met so many people who have been damaged by it. Sometimes it takes decades for people to acknowledge the pain. I've had 70-year-old women come to my retreats, who regret abortions they had when they were 20. As a society we don't understand abortion. I had an abortion and went into denial about it for years. I told myself for years that the circumstances were wrong, but my child is gone for ever and will never be replaced. After I went through this horrible grief, I realised there must be other women out there who feel the same way. That's why I founded the retreat and various other services. I've been all around the world, helping people who had abortions. I feel sorry for the pro-choice campaigners, because I think they are missing the point." READ MORE: Speaking out for the homeless at Dublin's Apollo house Ruth Murphy [Barbara McCarthy/Al Jazeera] Ruth Murphy is a 25-year-old who works in accounts. She took the day off work to strike for the repeal of the 8th amendment. "My boss was happy to let me take the time out for an important cause. I've forgone a day's wages, but I'm in a privileged position to be able to do that. I think it's important for me to be here today. I'm angry. I think women should be able to make decisions for themselves. It's not up to the government to interfere. Amongst my close friends, none of us have had abortions, but that doesn't make me feel like I shouldn't get involved. The Catholic Church in Ireland has controlled too many aspects of Irish society including women's reproductive rights, and I think this generation will try its best to put an end to it. Unfortunately there is still a stigma attached to having an abortion, but hopefully that will change soon." Stephen Quinn [Barbara McCarthy/Al Jazeera] Stephen Quinn is a 28-year-old from Dublin who works in theatre. He is galvanised by the mostly youth-driven movement, which is standing up to the establishment. "In 2015, the gay marriage referendum was passed in Ireland and there has been so much energy amongst young people who want to see real change. We're going to make significant inroads into changing the way Irish people think and feel about certain aspects of life. Ireland is still a secular place, and we need a separation between church and state. I went to a Catholic secondary school and its teachings affected me deeply. This is a very flamboyant movement, that's why I've been inspired to dress up. I know lots of men who are pro-choice and resisting the male-dominated culture that we live in." Fern Doonan [Barbara McCarthy/Al Jazeera] Fern Doonan is a 25-year-old bar worker who originally hails from West Cork in southern Ireland. She is pro-choice. "The abortion laws in Ireland are draconian. It's your uterus, your decision. Women are powerful, but we are limited in our lives and we shouldn't be. Having an abortion is a really difficult decision for anyone to take, made worse by the fact that they have to travel. We're exporting an issue. Having a pro-life view is outdated. The thing is that not everyone is ready for a child, and it's unfair for a child to be born into a world where no one can nourish them and protect them. It's inhumane to expect people to be parents when they're not equipped to be. This is an incredible movement and one I am proud to be part of."

The Catholic Church has faced a series of scandal in recent years [Al Jazeera] CORRECTION: 27/03/2017 -: Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that up to 800 infants had been buried in a disused sewage tank. Historian Catherine Corless, who investigated the case, has said in an Irish Times article that she believes the number to be fewer than 200. Tuam, Ireland - When human remains were discovered in a septic tank in Tuam, in western Ireland, last month it didn't come as a complete surprise to everyone. The unearthing at the site - a former home for unmarried mothers - was the result of a government commission charged with investigating claims of abuse by religious orders. Excavations uncovered an underground structure where human remains were found. Local historian Catherine Corless had initially uncovered details of a mass grave at the home run by the Catholic Church affiliated Bons Secours, where fewer than 200 infants born to unmarried mothers had been unofficially buried in a disused sewage tank. But a 2014 email sent by Bons Secours' PR representative Terry Prone to filmmaker Saskia Weber dismissed the need for an investigation into the site, saying: "If you come here, you'll find no mass grave, no evidence that children were ever so buried, and a local police force casting their eyes to heaven and saying 'Yeah, a few bones were found' - but this was an area where famine victims were buried. So?"

Long after the nuns had closed the doors of the home in Tuam in 1961, Louise Gallagher found herself in one of Ireland's last Mother and Baby Homes in 1988. "When I heard about Tuam. I didn't feel right. I felt awful but I couldn't explain it," the 44-year-old says. "Younger women like me didn't have it as bad as the older ones, we didn't have to work for years in the laundries, so you feel guilty for being upset." "But really, I was never right after my baby was taken from me. It's like being in a permanent state of grief." Louise, who lived in rural Ireland, discovered that she was pregnant when she was 16. But being a single mother carried a stigma perpetuated by the Catholic Church and spurred on by wider society.

"It was arranged between my mother, the local doctor and Cura - a Catholic crisis pregnancy organisation," she says. "I spent two months there, the place was full of girls when I arrived. My mother said I would have to sleep on the floor if there was no bed for me." "I never had a choice, I felt powerless and that I should be grateful." Mass graves Ireland's Mother and Baby homes were residential establishments for unmarried pregnant women run by the Church and funded by the state. Parents would often take their unmarried pregnant daughters - shunned by the community - to them.

They were thrown into mass graves on land owned by the Catholic Church. Many women entered as minors and were forced to give their children up for adoption, signing the papers under the watchful eyes of nuns and social workers. "They used us to make money," says Louise. "We used to pack cards for the nuns in the home, we weren't forced to but you were made to feel grateful even when they took our babies." "They were also getting money from the government to 'deal with' us. One wealthy girl I shared a room with told me her parents were giving a donation to the nuns and the couples that got our babies also gave donations to the Orders." "We were brought from the home into Holles Street Hospital, in Dublin, for maternity care and then the Catholic Protection and Rescue Services of Ireland who managed our forced adoptions. Everyone was taking their cut," she adds. Despite the discovery in Tuam, the religious Orders in Ireland have failed to contribute to redress schemes for women whose children died or were adopted out of Mother and Baby homes. Compensation Ireland's Minister for Health Simon Harri, has demanded a more hardline approach to the Orders, which have failed to compensate the victims of church abuse. So far, the religious Orders - who are supposed to pay for half the scheme - have contributed €192 million ($207m) of the €1.5 billion ($1.6bn) required to compensate those affected. Clare Daly, an independent member of parliament, says the schemes are poorly constructed and allow both the Church and the state to shirk responsibility. But she agrees with Harris that more needs to be done to hold the religious Orders to account. READ MORE: Ireland's shocking record on women's rights "Obviously the original deal was a bad one for the Irish taxpayer and the survivors of abuse, and a good one for the religious Orders who got off very lightly. At this stage huge pressure should be put on the religious organisations to fulfil their original commitments. While it seems that they have no legal obligation they certainly have a moral one," she says. As well as refusing to fully compensate the women sent to Mother and Baby homes, the religious Orders have been accused of silencing those who say they were abused in Church-run, state-funded industrial schools for orphans and children of unmarried parents. Victims of Church abuse Tom Wall, from the small town of Glin, County Limerick, was sent to an industrial school run by the Christian Brothers, after a judge signed a document giving the Church custody of him. He remained there from 1952 until he turned 16 in 1965. During that time he says he was sexually abused and routinely beaten. Tom, who wrote a book about his time in Glin, is now embroiled in a legal battle with the Christian Brothers, who he claims are deliberately trying to conceal the extent of abuse faced by children under Church guardianship. "When the Christian Brothers were leaving Glin in 1973, I was ordered by the Superior Brother Murry to burn all the documents that he gave me, but was told that I could keep any that I particularly wanted," he recalls. "As I was looking for my own file I held back some of the documents that I had been told to burn and I put them in the attic of a house in Glin. In 2015, I donated this collection to the University of Limerick." Tom was the last boy sent to the industrial school, but his battles with the Order he says abused him haven't yet ended. The Christian Brothers are currently asserting property rights over the files and letters sent to the boys by family members who tried to contact them. The Order claims the documents are the property of the Church and do not belong in the university archives. "I don't understand how the Christian Brothers who were found guilty of serious physical, sexual and emotional abuse of children that were under state care in the industrial schools can now claim to own the last remaining documents recording the lives of these boys, many of whom they abused," the 67-year-old says. Clare thinks files like those Tom preserved need to be handed over to the government to fully assess the scope and impact of Ireland's history of confinement.

Al Jazeera wrote to the European Province of the Congregation of Christian Brothers to request comment but did not receive a reply by the time of publication. Legal battles As Ireland grapples with the latest in a long line of Church scandals, those sent to Catholic institutions remain at the coalface of costly legal battles against a Church that shows little sign of remorse and a state frequently criticised by the United Nations for failing to provide adequate redress. Wendy Lyon, a human rights lawyer based in the Irish capital Dublin, represents survivors of institutional abuse. She claims Ireland's statute of limitations and ex gratia tags - which absolve the state of responsibility - are blockades to justice for survivors of these institutions. "In Ireland, the statute of limitations is absolute. Unlike other countries this means there's no provision for a court to waive the statute of limitations in the interest of justice. Then, every redress scheme we are presented with is progressively worse, they are still talking about ex gratia schemes," she says. Wendy believes the state will only address cases of historical abuses when prompted by the media, and uses its legal cannon to block those seeking financial redress. READ MORE: Ireland accused of whitewashing childbirth scandal "Currently the state is obstructing women from access to these inadequate schemes. Now we have two cases in the court for women locked out of schemes, for not fitting their criteria. The state is going to great lengths to keep them out of financial redress, which is strange when you consider how much they pay in legal costs," she says. Louise says that she continues to be haunted by the unrepentant attitude of the Church. "I firmly put the blame on the Church," she says. "The society enabled it and funded it but they guided the values at the time. I've spent my whole life feeling inferior because of them, since I was 16, I just don't know what it is like to feel normal. I still feel so much shame."

Byrne's skeleton is on display in London but ethicists say it is time to respect his wishes to be laid to rest [Paul Dean] London, United Kingdom - Irish folklore is peppered with tales of giants roaming the land but, when a real giant travelled to London in the 18th century, he met a grisly fate that would rival even the most far-fetched of myths. His name was Charles Byrne. Born in Northern Ireland's County Derry in 1761, he now occupies a glass cabinet surrounded by anatomical and zoological specimens in the Hunterian Museum inside the Royal College of Surgeons, London. His residence is the subject of fierce debate between those who wish to protect the lifesaving quality of his DNA and those who advocate for the burial that he was denied. Byrne, third from right, with George Cranstoun - a dwarf, and three other men [Wellcome Images] Byrne stood at the towering height of seven feet and seven inches - tall enough to light his pipe from street lanterns. Undiagnosed during his lifetime, Byrne suffered from a benign tumour in the pituitary gland of his brain which prompted an excess of somatotropin, also known as human growth hormone. His stature propelled him. In his late teenage years, he travelled across the Irish Sea to England to seek his fortune as a human curiosity, oblivious to the macabre ending that would befall him. By the time Byrne's one-man circus arrived in London, his reputation had preceded him and paying crowds clamoured for an audience with the eloquent and elegantly-dressed giant who exhibited himself in an apartment above a cane shop near Trafalgar Square. Within weeks, Byrne was feted by assorted members of high society, among them a man that would help define Byrne's legacy, for better or worse. Death and deceit Scottish-born John Hunter was one of the most esteemed surgeons of 18th century Britain who pioneered an approach of rigorous experimentation and observation. He made important contributions to the studies of anatomy, physiology and pathology. He also developed an attraction to Charles Byrne, although it is unknown if Hunter ever visited him personally. After a year's performing in London, Byrne's finances flourished, but his health was deteriorating as the pain of his untreated gigantism persisted. To compound his misery, his savings - which he unwisely kept on his person when drinking in a tavern one evening - were pick-pocketed. Following this episode, Byrne became severely dispirited, compounded by the worsening pain of his condition. In June 1783, he died aged 22. Hunter boiled Byrne's body, drained all tissue and fat, and years later would unveil his newest exhibit to the world - the skeleton of the Irish Giant which now stands in a glass cabinet, the centrepiece of the museum that bears Hunter's name He had contracted tuberculosis and had other complications arising from his gigantism; it was also reported he had been drinking to excess. Knowing he was dying, Byrne reportedly instructed his friends to bury his body at sea in a lead coffin. He was terrified was he of being anatomised and displayed in a museum, subject to curiosity even in death. But London's surgical community was quick to act. On June 5, 1783, the Morning Herald newspaper observed a crowd of surgeons "surrounding [Byrne's] house just as Greenland harpooners would an enormous whale". However, none were as prepared as Hunter to obtain Byrne's body. Through intermediaries, Hunter made repeated offers of vast sums of money for Byrne to sell him his body upon death, all of which Byrne refused. The surgeon then bribed one of Byrne's associates who, with a henchman hired by Hunter, opened the coffin and replaced the body with large rocks. They carted the cadaver back to London while Byrne's friends slept. Hunter boiled Byrne's body, drained all tissue and fat, and years later would unveil his newest exhibit to the world - the skeleton of the Irish Giant which now stands in a glass cabinet, the centrepiece of the museum that bears Hunter's name. Historian Wendy Moore, author of The Knife Man, a biography of Hunter, told Al Jazeera that although body-snatching was common in London, Hunter overstepped the boundaries.Why Hunter hid the skeleton so long remains a mystery, some say it was guilt, while others say it took time to assemble. Much of Hunter's collection remained largely private, so it was not unusual to limit public access to an exhibit. "I think initially he was motivated by scientific curiosity of the giant, particularly because he was trying to understand how life on Earth first began and was interested in any deviation from the norm," she said. "But it was clear that the giant was going to be a trophy for his museum too. He couldn't help himself; he let his collecting mania get hold of him." Medical ethicists weigh in This perceived historical injustice has prompted medical ethicists and other campaigners to lobby the museum to honour Byrne's wishes. "I became sympathetic to the view that his remains had not been given posthumous respect," Thomas Muinzer, a doctor and legal lecturer at the University of Stirling, told Al Jazeera. "There is enough evidence to conclude that Charles didn't want his body to be snatched and put on display. The Edinburgh Evening Courant reported at the time that Byrne would be carried to Margate to be thrown into the sea 'agreeable to his own request'." The Hunterian Museum, which is currently closed for refurbishment, has consistently defended displaying Byrne's remains, citing the absence of direct evidence of his burial wishes. In 2011, trustees of the Hunterian Museum Brendan rejected calls by Muinzer and others to liberate Byrne's skeleton. "The Hunterian Collecting Trustees consider that the educational and research benefits of exhibiting Byrne's remains merit their retention," a spokesman told Al Jazeera. A key figure in the establishment of post-mortem examinations, Hunter's thirst for knowledge required a constant supply of bodies to cut and probe. In his time, people tended not to leave their bodies to science, so Hunter had little recourse but to acquire his cadavers from the overflowing cemeteries of London, often obtaining bodies of paupers and criminals. Resurrectionists or Body Snatchers were much-feared. John Hunter retained their services to ensure a constant supply of bodies for dissection. Illustration by 'Phiz' (Hablot K Browne) 1887 [Getty Images] For this, he maintained a web of undertakers, policemen, coroners and grave robbers on his payroll who would inform him of the latest corpses interred. Most coveted were those of abnormal size or with deformities; they would be delivered by horse and carriage to the courtyard of Hunter's home. These men, "The Resurrectionists", were widely feared, including by Byrne, who, hailing from rural Ireland was likely to have been an observant Christian. Such was the literal belief in the dead rising from the grave on the Day of Judgement that any interference with a corpse was thought to compromise a person's acceptance into heaven. A distinguished doctor and well-respected member of society by day, by night, an obsessive character that liaised with the underworld - it is no surprise a contemporary of Hunter was Robert Louis Stevenson, author of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Descriptions of Jekyll and his home bear a strong resemblance to the Scottish surgeon and his Leicester Square townhouse. 'Byrne is in the folk consciousness' Muinzer's growing interest led him to Byrne's rural homeland to conduct field research, roaming the villages and pubs interrogating the locals about the giant's legacy. "Byrne is in the folk consciousness of the older generations who were brought up with his story," Muinzer says. "He used to be associated with a local heritage site called the Giants' Grave, so-called because they say Byrne laid down at that site and said: 'When I die I want to buried here'. As he lay there, his friends dug a trench around him, so it made a silhouetted imprint of a man in the earth." Marta Korbonits, doctor and professor of endocrinology at Queen Mary University, London, established the genetic commonality of pituitary gigantism in 2006 after she noticed her patients were all natives of a precise area of mid-Ulster, Northern Ireland. "Consider genetics as a book and every letter is a building block of a gene. A mutation is like one misspelling in the book - the Irish families I met had the same misspelling, imagine the mathematical possibility of this. Clinically the picture began to come clear," Korbonits told Al Jazeera. You have to accept the social values of 1780s London - this was a time when live human beings were bought and sold, so it didn't seem that buying and selling dead bodies was such a big deal Marta Korbonits, doctor and professor of endocrinology at Queen Mary University "Suddenly I remembered there is this famous Irish giant in the museum around the corner and thought, 'Could there be a link?'" Korbonits subsequently persuaded the Hunterian to allow her to send samples of Byrne's teeth away for DNA tests. The results showed that the part of Ireland Byrne came from was a "giant hotspot", and her team embarked on a population screening there to promote early treatment for carriers of the genetic mutation. "It's strange to see a human skeleton in a glass case with lights on him," said Korbonits. "You wonder, 'is that how I would like to end up?' On the other hand, I am the beneficiary of his experience through the DNA research, so it is mixed feelings. "I don't suppose anyone wants to end up the way he did since he fully expressed his wishes that he be buried at sea. But I think you have to accept the social values of 1780s London - this was a time when live human beings were bought and sold, so it didn't seem that buying and selling dead bodies was such a big deal." "I believe it would be possible to make a replica of the skeleton, and personally I think Byrne should have his wish and his body [be] buried at sea now. I think it's the right thing to do," said biographer Wendy Moore Such an act would not be without precedent. Byrne died age 22 and had wished to be buried at sea [Public Domain] In the last decade, the Maori community has arranged a series of repatriations of bones that were seized by American and European anthropologists centuries ago and exhibited in museums and private collections to their ancestral homeland of New Zealand. Korbonits claims that it is impossible to know what more Byrne's remains may be able to tell us. "If reports from the time are correct, then what happened to Byrne's body is unacceptable. But I would be very short-sighted and full of myself if I claimed that I discovered everything that needs to be known from the remains and there is nothing left to be found." But for hardliners such as Muinzer, the mere act of displaying Byrne is an outrage. "The Royal College of Surgeons says that he is of great value to medical science but that doesn't presuppose that you need to display the remains as a curiosity piece, or as a freak exhibit as I have heard it described, in the memorial museum to the person who is responsible for the theft of the remains." Among specimens such as mummified remains, Winston Churchill's dentures and the rectum of a former Bishop of Durham, Byrne's haunting skeleton stands in the centre of the museum. A bust of John Hunter is perched on a shelf above, watching over him, their fame forever intertwined. The museum confirmed to Al Jazeera that Byrne's skeleton would remain on display upon its reopening. 'Giant' genetic relative speaks out Brendan Holland, 65, admits some "creepy similarities" between his life and Byrne's. Both grew up around 10 miles from each other, moved to London as young men and worked near Trafalgar Square - in Holland's case as a civil servant in the ministry of agriculture. Holland stands at over six feet and nine inches tall and has since discovered he is a genetic relative of Byrne after research into pituitary gigantism found a genetic link. If keeping the skeleton plays a small part in looking after those people and curing them as soon as possible, then it's a small price to pay Brendan Holland, genetic relative of Charles Byrne with gigantism Speaking to Al Jazeera by telephone, Holland explained how living with gigantism was a daily struggle before he sought treatment at the age of 20. "Apart from the obvious spurt of growth, I was having headaches, tiredness, fatigue and generally feeling unwell and underpowered. It was affecting my whole immune system, and at one stage I contracted tuberculosis. Before medication became available, most men and women affected by this didn't live beyond their mid-twenties." Holland, Byrne's genetic relative, says he doesn't want to "get on [his] moral high-horse" on the ethical argument and instead highlights the importance of raising awareness of pituitary gigantism. "We need to expand the public awareness of the condition, particularly where I am from. It's insidious; it can lie dormant for generations and suddenly pops up and presents itself. If keeping the skeleton plays a small part in looking after those people and curing them as soon as possible then it's a small price to pay."

In 2013 Ireland passed the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act in response to the death of Savita Halappanavar during her pregnancy [AFP/Getty Images] Hashmat Moslih recently wrote an opinion piece noting that the concept of human rights faces huge challenges in a culturally diverse global setting. He states: "It is impossible to develop a harmonised human rights philosophy that is not circular. At the heart of the issue of human rights runs the issue of justice and at the heart of justice runs the issue of happiness and it is argued that happiness is attained through acquiring a good life and a good life is one that insures everyone's well-being. But how do we define well-being?" There are many definitions of well-being, grounded in various cultural, religious, and historical contexts. Furthermore, as Moslih notes, there are contested views about what constitute fundamental rights, and whether we can ever consider these non-ideological. For example, there is by no means an international consensus about whether sexual and reproductive rights can be considered universal. Despite this, the words of Morena Herrera, the leader of the Agrupacion Ciudadana por la Despanalizacion del Aborto ( Citizens Group for the Depenalisation of Abortion ), during a personal interview, will always ring clearly in my mind: "by ruling against an abortion [in the case of Beatriz], El Salvador is ruling against the life of a woman." I find it hard to see how ruling against the life of a woman comfortably fits within any definition of well-being. If we do accept Moslih's argument that human rights are ideological and based on purely Western historical developments, we are still faced with the question, who is to decide what "well-being" is? And in the case of women whose lives are threatened by their pregnancies, who is to decide whose rights are to be upheld: the mother's or the foetus'? Women's lives in danger It has been over a year since we read about the shocking case of Beatriz in El Salvador. We were outraged when the Salvadoran government refused an abortion to a young woman who suffered from lupus and renal failure, who became pregnant with an anencephalic foetus that had no chance of survival outside the womb. Even when the Supreme Court eventually allowed a caesarean delivery, it did so only to give itself " a way out of a legal wrangle ". The court's initial refusal to provide life-saving medical treatment was a " disgraceful violation of [Beatriz's] fundamental human rights."

In a state of emotional distress, the girl attempted to commit suicide by jumping from her roof. She survived the suicide attempt, but was denied important surgery for her injuries when it was confirmed that she was pregnant. The request for a therapeutic abortion (legal in Peru under the circumstances of danger to the life of the mother) in order to undergo the necessary surgery was denied. Eventually she was allowed the surgical procedure, but had a miscarriage. She is now paraplegic, and is unable to afford the rehabilitation treatments she needs. This case inspires shock and outrage - how is it possible to deny the rights of a rape victim, at the cost of her physical health for the rest of her life? Most recently, we read about the case of the unnamed rape victim in the Republic of Ireland. The country has a law in which abortion is permitted when a woman is at risk of suicide. Despite being assessed by three separate medical experts who agreed that there was a risk of suicide, the victim was denied an abortion, and was forced to give birth via caesarean section. The Guardian noted that the case of this rape victim was the first proper test of Ireland's law, the 2013 Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, and that "critics say the law has proved of no practical value to the woman in this case." The law was made in the wake of the Savita Halappanavar case , a woman who died from septicaemia due a miscarriage after also being denied an abortion in 2012. It is widely known that severe mental suffering can result from the denial of abortion in specific cases. Ireland is a perfect example of how, every year or so, we see "flash in the pan" cases in which, for a week or so, we are forced to deal with the uncomfortable reality that various societies continue to make women suffer degrading treatment. Eventually the stories go silent, the headlines move to newer stories, but these women are left with permanent physical and psychological scars. So what do we say to these women? That the rights they were given by CEDAW, which their governments signed on to, and which, if upheld, could have averted their tragic fates are too Western and too ideological? What can we offer them instead? If we choose to protect these women and grant what they are asking for - abortion - do we really allow the individual to take primacy over society, as Moslih argues? Does saving the life of one woman endanger the rest of society? And who decides what is good for society? The majority dominated by a voice empowered by patriarchy? Or perhaps the powerful few at the top who control tools of persuasion and coercion? And as we engage in the endless squabble of what is Western, what is ideological and what a human right is, women - whose lives, health, and dignity could have been saved - continue to suffer, waiting for this debate to be resolved.

Orange Order's colourful carnival march may have been the loud cry of a dying animal, writes Seth-Smith [Reuters] The Orange Order march on September 13 through Scotland's capital felt like the last stand of a community being left behind. With 15,000 marchers, it was by far the biggest street demonstration against Scottish independence, to be voted on in a few days. Yet, it took place without the blessing of the official no camp, Better Together, who plainly didn't want it taking place. Their fears that this mixing of politics and religion by the Protestant Orange lodges, with their history in sectarian conflict, might backfire, may have been justified given the following poll that showed the Yes campaign continuing to push ahead with an eight percent lead. Whether or not it swayed some "undecideds" and Catholic voters to back independence, the march certainly didn't do the Unionist cause any good. Why did the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland decide to go ahead? Before the march, a senior figure of the Order made a speech to those gathered. "Let me remind you that when an enemy came against the city of Londonderry, God's people famously said there will be no surrender," he said. "Well, a divisive and evil enemy has risen against Scotland in the guise of false patriotism and the nationalist referendum."

Today, it is Alex Salmond and the independence movement that is perceived as sieging the battlements, and 2,000 Northern Irish compatriots flooded down in their busloads to join the Scottish and "defend the United Kingdom". However, not even the marchers seemed to believe that they would help preserve the UK. I talked to a member of the Brigeton Loyalists Flute Band as he downed a morning pint before the march began. "There's been discussion in the community about whether this should go ahead," he confided. "But we wanted a show of support." A restaurant owner from Glasgow, he has real fears for the working class in an independent Scotland. "The world's a scary place, and it will be even scarier as an independent small country," he tells me. "This will be nothing but bad for the working man, it's us that will suffer." The Orange Order claims around 50,000 members in Scotland. The vast majority are Protestant working class from the Scottish lowlands, many of whose ancestors migrated from Ireland to Scotland in the 19th century. The lodges have long ceased to have any real political clout, while their parades often further damage their reputation , through drunkenness, disorder, and scrums between Rangers and Celtic football fans. This summer, a 12-year-old girl was hit by a bottle in the face while watching a march in central Glasgow, strengthening support for City Council plans to limit the number of parades . September 13's "British Together" march passed off peacefully, but what will happen to this fiercely Unionist community if Scotland goes independent this week? I asked Graham Walker from the Research Institute of Irish and Scottish Studies about the possibilities. "The Orange Order hasn't wielded political influence for some time, but it's a channel for certain political frustrations," he said. "There's a possibility that people will become extremely alienated and disaffected, they may feel that the Orange Order is not the organisation they can turn to for comfort, and that's potentially dangerous, as they may turn to other groups." Fertile ground for new recruits Those worried at that prospect have pointed to the presence of the far-right street movement and party Britain First at the Orange Order parade on September 13. There were only a dozen or so of this relatively new force , easily spotted in their paramilitary-style uniforms, but they clearly felt they were on fertile ground for new recruits. On September 12, Nigel Farage of the UK Independence Party had held a rally in Glasgow, failing to mention the Orange Order march or his controversial support of an Orange hardliner for a party position. The Orange Order has its base in communities once renowned for mining, ship building, and heavy industry, where Irish immigrants flocked for work in the 19th century, now some of the poorest areas in Scotland. The majority of supporters have Irish ancestry if not close family, and there are fears that Scottish independence would strengthen nationalists in Ireland. While the political class in Ireland has largely maintained a diplomatic silence, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams has spoken of the "so-called United Kingdom" which is "hanging by a thread". Only four percent in Northern Ireland want to push for a united Ireland according to last year's poll and support in the Republic has never been lower, with no desire for a return to the civil war often called "The Troubles". Nevertheless, a Yes vote would send a nervous shock through the Unionist community in Northern Ireland, particularly those with close family in Scotland. I spoke to a woman from Fife at the march, Marie McCaughey, who was proud of her Ulster Scots name. Her sister had come down from Belfast, and she pointed to her 11-year-old son, saying he'd been crying that morning about the future of their country. "We've all intertwined through the generations, and a Yes vote will put an end to that," she said. "It's dividing the country, dividing families." Britain's family of nations Alex Salmond has argued that independence does not mean a weakening of ties between Britain' s family of nations. At the same time, higher levels of support for a Yes vote among lower income groups show that the working classes are listening to pledges of more equality and fairness. These arguments won't reach the community out in force last Saturday, despite many of them coming from Scotland's most deprived areas. Tom Devine, a leading Scottish historian on sectarianism, sees them as already a relic of history. "They cling to an Orange identity, coming from the heritage of the past, as they have very little else to cling onto. Their communities are riven by unemployment, by alcoholism and drugs," he told me. "In a sense they've got nowhere to go." Over the last half century, Scotland has secularised rapidly. Even the Church of Scotland has distanced themselves from the Orange Order over the years. While their membership has begun creeping up again, this is likely a response to the threat of independence. The colourful carnival march on September 13 with its piercing flutes and deafening drums may have been the loud cry of a dying animal. If there is a Yes vote on September 18, a community already marginalised in Scottish society may find themselves further sidelined. Like many of the unknowns in an independent Scotland, what outlets they find to express their frustration remains to be seen.

These Greek elections should teach us that new forms of political participation must be invented, writes Tzafalias [AP] Sunday's national elections in Greece, where the nominally far left party Syriza is poised to win, could actually change Europe and the world, but not for the reasons you think. We have three scenarios to consider at the outset. Will Alexis Tsipras, the leader who took his party from the political hinterlands to centre-stage in the short space of four years, win an outright majority and form a government? Will there be a new coalition government? Or will the country need to go to elections again? In this fluid political climate, it is not out of the question for xenophobic and ultranationalist Golden Dawn party leader Nicholaos Michaloliakos, currently held in pre-trial detention in Korydallos prison, to be asked to form a government. And that is just the beginning. How will a new Greek administration, whichever form it takes, negotiate with Greece's international creditors which include the daunting to many International Monetary Fund? And how will a possible Syriza victory inspire other countries and other electorates in Europe and the world? Deep pool of questions In this maelstrom of questions, there is a single point of reference and that is unstable too; the European Central Bank, the monetary, and up to a point, the fiscal nerve centre of the euro currency area.

It is a move that came at the last minute in the hope of averting deflation and possibly kick-starting growth in the euro area. And Greece must play by the rules if it wants to take a nibble of this new carrot and not keep feeling the proverbial stick on its austerity-slashed back. At the same time, we see the Swiss franc exploding in value, the Russian rouble collapsing and the price of oil falling through the floor. Market players are scrambling to find safe havens for funds or considering where to place their next lucrative bet. So this latest ECB move might amount to nothing much. So we come back to Greece itself. Rich not getting richer According to World Bank indicators, Greece is still a rich nation but there are clear signs of a drop in per capita income and a collapse in investment. These are trends that cannot easily be reversed, so things will get worse before there is a chance of them getting better. We also are witnessing a fall in environmental standards. Across Europe there is a trend for diluting or even scrapping environmental regulation to favour economic development. So how can a country such as Greece actually inspire others? Incidentally, one of the few countries that managed to avoid the so-called middle income trap and join the elite of prosperous nations was Greece, along with Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland. PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY So how can a country such as Greece actually inspire others? Incidentally, one of the few countries that managed to avoid the so-called middle income trap and join the elite of prosperous nations was Greece, along with Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland. They all are struggling with their finances. A possible reversal of prosperity is something that countries like China, Indonesia and Malaysia are trying to avoid. Greek debt indeed again has become an international issue . One thing that Greece can do and one for which Tsipras should get the credit, is to call for a "European debt conference" . The idea was taken up by Irish politicians, as their country is also suffering under loan programmes. The conference would address not only Greek and Irish debt but Spanish and Portuguese debt as well. The IMF and its French chief Christine Lagarde (let us not forget French big business) reacted immediately, warning against such a move . To get an idea of the IMF's mentality, one need only skim its report on Greece from last summer. Loan conditions Ominous loan conditions quaintly are described as "arrangements" and policy debacles as "falling short of targets". It is the kind of language that would describe the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima as an "alternative peace implementation initiative". This possibility for change is why Greece has caught the imagination of activists around the world. In the restive Athens neighbourhood of Exarchia it is not rare to see "crisis tourists", usually young men and women who dream of confronting the riot police to vent their rage before returning to the rule-of-law safety of their respective countries. But when even the French far right leader Marine Le Pen openly supports a Syriza victory , something is wrong. Voter participation and membership of traditional political parties is falling across Europe, according to a report by the Economist's Intelligence Unit for the BBC. Democracy needs to change. One thing these Greek elections should teach us is that new forms of political participation must be invented or we shall remain at the mercy of nebulous "market forces" and those elites who know how to play a global game which is technocratic in name only.

In death, as in life, Martin McGuinness divided opinion. The Daily Mail called the one-time Northern Ireland deputy first minster who died this week "Britain's Number One Terrorist". The Irish Times - a newspaper not known for fawning portrayals of Irish republicanism - declared that McGuinness's "place in Irish history is assured". The former provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) commander and Sinn Fein leader succumbed to a rare heart condition following a short illness. But debates over McGuinness' life and his legacy - in Britain, in Ireland and beyond - are likely to continue long after his contemporaries in London and Dublin have shuffled off the political stage.

There were no soixante-huitards on the banks of the Foyle, but, inspired by events in Paris and elsewhere, a new generation were demanding civil rights. Since its foundation in 1920, Northern Ireland had boasted a "Protestant parliament for a Protestant people". The Catholic minority - at the time around a third of the population - were often discriminated against in jobs and housing. The situation was arguably at its worst in Derry, where extreme gerrymandering ensured a Protestant minority retained political control over an overwhelmingly Catholic population. In October 1968, McGuinness was an 18-year-old assistant in a Derry butcher's shop when local police attacked civil rights marchers. OPINION: Contending with the past in Northern Ireland In later years, McGuinness adduced the incident - which he heard about from his father - in explaining his decision to join the growing republican movement a few months later. On the streets, Northern Ireland was descending into sectarian chaos. Civil rights protests gave way to violence. Loyalists attacked Catholics. Security forces clashed with republicans. Martin McGuinness addresses a republican crowd in Milltown Cemetery in April 1995 [Crispin Rodwell/Reuters] 'Probably carrying a machine gun' In January 1972, McGuinness was in Derry when British soldiers opened fire on civilians. Fourteen people were killed. The subsequent Saville inquiry found that the then second-in-command of the local IRA was "probably" carrying a sub-machine gun on the day of the massacre. The gun has gone from Northern Ireland's politics, but whether the next generation of political leaders - on both sides of the Irish Sea - have the ability, and the willingness, to reach the kind of compromises Martin McGuinness made remains to be seen. McGuinness quickly rose through the ranks of the IRA. He was often evasive about his role - demurring when asked directly in 2015 if he had killed British soldiers - and even claimed to have left the IRA in 1974. But in reality, the young Derryman with the curly Art Garfunkel mop was an integral figure during a period when the IRA were responsible for the deaths of around a third of the more than 3,000 people killed during Northern Ireland's "Troubles". At the same time, however, McGuinness was also involved in various stalled ceasefire initiatives. McGuinness was part of an IRA delegation that met Secretary of State Willie Whitelaw in London in 1972. The following year, he met MI6 man Michael Oatley, beginning a relationship that would last until the secret serviceman's retirement nearly two decades later. By the time a peace agreement was finally signed, in 1998, McGuinness was Sinn Fein's lead negotiator. No wonder McGuinness's death has cast such an ambivalent shadow. Here was a man of violence who became feted, by many, as a peacemaker. A man who led an armed campaign for a united Ireland for three decades, ended his career at the apex of a devolved government within the UK , but never felt that he had conceded his republican beliefs. McGuinness played a key role in the peace process. That a serious split in the notoriously fissiparous republican movement was avoided in late 1990s owed much to his reputation as hard man in IRA circles. McGuinness spent months selling the peace deal to at times reluctant rank-and-file. Later, as Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, McGuinness decried dissident republicans as "traitors to the island of Ireland", a remarkable comment from a one-time IRA chief. Britain's Queen Elizabeth II shaking hands with former Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness on her arrival at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast, Northern Ireland in June 2012 [Paul Faith/EPA] McGuinness will doubtless be remembered for the once unthinkable bipartisan moments. In 2007, he entered into a power-sharing government with his former nemesis, unionist firebrand Ian Paisley. The two struck up such rapport that they became known as the "Chuckle Brothers". McGuinness's meetings with the Queen appeared genuinely warm, reflecting a man often said to be charismatic and engaging in private, but who also displayed a military ruthlessness.

Former IRA leader, Cathal Goulding, who rejected violence in the 1970s, famously quipped that McGuinness and Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams were "right, but too late" in laying down their arms. McGuinness's death leaves a palpable gap in Northern Irish politics. A master of strategy, he used his resignation in January to trigger the collapse of the devolved legislature at Stormont amid the "cash for ash" scandal. The subsequent election saw Sinn Fein's vote rise sharply under new leader, 40-year-old Michelle O'Neill. For the first time in its history, Northern Ireland no longer has a unionist majority. Northern Ireland's future remains uncertain. There is little sign of the power-sharing government being reinstated anytime soon. Brexit raises the spectre of a hard Irish border, and with its fears of economic disruption renewed dissident republican attacks. Those who fought the Northern Irish war - and the peace - are nearing the end.

RenderPagesVideo('5366582924001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness, a former deputy first minister of Northern Ireland and IRA commander who was a key figure in Irish politics for five decades, has died at 66, prompting tributes from allies and enemies alike. Ireland's state broadcaster RTE reported his death on Tuesday and said that he had died at Derry's Altnagelvin Hospital with his family by his side. The face of Irish Republicanism for many during three decades of violence that killed more than 3,600 people, McGuinness remained a figure of hate for many pro-British Protestants until his death. But he earned widespread respect across Britain and Ireland by embracing his bitterest rivals to cement a peace deal in 1998 that allowed Northern Ireland to slowly return to normality. As a young Irish Republican Army (IRA) fighter, he saw his mission as defending the Catholic minority against the largely pro-British Protestants who for decades dominated Northern Ireland.

He went on, though, to serve as deputy first minister in a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. Key to its success was his close relationship with Ian Paisley, a firebrand preacher many Catholics see as a key player in the genesis of the conflict. A partnership many thought would prove impossible was soon dubbed by the media "the Chuckle Brothers" and allowed McGuinness to become Northern Ireland's deputy first minister in 2007. "Martin McGuinness, certainly when I was growing up, was the godfather of the IRA and he was a man who struck terror quite literally into the hearts and into the lives of many, many people and that moved of course from being the godfather to being the man in government and that remarkable journey is something that is incredibly important," Paisley's son, Ian Paisley Junior, also a leading politician, said. WATCH: Walls of shame - Northern Ireland's Troubles "As a Christian, as someone who reflects on life, it's not how you start your life that is important, but how you finish your life." McGuinness was hailed as a peacemaker for negotiating the 1998 peace deal, sharing power with his once bitter enemy Paisley and shaking hands with the British Queen, though the gestures were condemned by some former comrades as treachery. Unlike his close Belfast associate, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams, McGuinness was always open about the fact that he had been a senior leader of the IRA - classed as a "terrorist organisation" by the British government. "Martin McGuinness never went to war, it came to his streets, it came to his city, it came to his community," Adams told RTE on Tuesday. "He was a great man in my opinion and he will be missed." McGuinness appeared unmasked at early IRA press conferences, and the BBC filmed him walking through his native Bogside area of Derry discussing how its command structure worked. During one of his two Dublin trials for IRA membership, he declared from the dock he was "a member of the Derry Brigade of the IRA and I'm very, very proud of it." In government, McGuinness developed a bond with Ian Paisley, a former bitter foe [Reuters] Tony Blair, who was British prime minister during the process that led to the 1998 agreement, said he had come to know a man that had decided to set aside armed struggle to seek peace. "There will be some who cannot forget the bitter legacy of the war," Blair said. "And for those who lost loved ones in it that is completely understandable. But for those of us able finally to bring about the Northern Ireland peace agreement, we know we could never have done it without Martin's leadership, courage and quiet insistence that the past should not define the future." Ireland's president, Michael D Higgins, praised his commitment to democracy and said his leadership would be missed in both Northern Ireland and the Republic. "As President of Ireland, I wish to pay tribute to his immense contribution to the advancement of peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland - a contribution which has rightly been recognised across all shades of opinion," he said in a statement.

At the time, frail and emotional, he told a large group of supporters gathered outside his home in the Bogside area of Northern Ireland's second city that it broke his heart that he had to bow out of politics.

Ibrahim Halawa was arrested by Egyptian security forces when he was just 17 in August 2013 [Courtesy of Somaia Halawa] An Irish citizen facing the death penalty has entered his fifth year of incarceration in Egypt without being brought to trial, a milestone that has angered family members and rights groups who have campaigned for his release. Friends and family gathered outside the Egyptian embassy in Dublin on Thursday, marking four years of Ibrahim Halawa 's imprisonment. Halawa , now 21, was just 17 years old when he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in Cairo in August 2013. He was held as part of a crackdown on protesters rallying against the government of Abdel Fattah El Sisi , which was then newly in power. He has attended several mass trials with hundreds of prisoners, but the court date has been postponed more than 30 times. "Ibrahim and hundreds of others were arrested, and jointly accused of responsibility for violence," a statement by human rights organisation Reprieve said. "Though he was just 17 - a juvenile - at the time of his arrest, Ibrahim faces the death penalty in a mass trial of 494 people."

The three sisters were released on bail three months later. "Four years is too long for someone who is innocent," Somaia said.

Meanwhile, the Irish Minister of Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said his government was determined to see the release of Halawa .

Ibrahim Halawa says he was regularly tortured while in prison [Courtesy of Somaia Halawa] An Egyptian criminal court has acquitted an Irish-Egyptian man kept in pre-trial detention for four years who says he was regularly tortured during his incarceration. Ibrahim Halawa - arrested at age 17 as part of a deadly crackdown on protests in Cairo and who faced the death penalty - has yet to walk free following Monday's verdict, said defence lawyer Yasmeen Said. He is the son of a senior Muslim Brotherhood member - a group that swept to power in elections after the 2011 uprising but is now outlawed by the government of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi .

The sisters were released three months later on bail, but Halawa was kept in custody. UK-based international human rights organisation, Reprieve, which is assisting Ibrahim, said in a statement Monday's verdict was "long overdue". "Ibrahim was arrested as a child for the 'crime' of attending a protest, tortured, and tried facing the death penalty alongside adults in an unfair mass trial," said Maya Foa, director of Reprieve. "For years, these court proceedings - which were designed to punish political dissent - made a mockery of justice." She also said the Irish government and others "must now not rest until Ibrahim is at home in Ireland". "The wider international community - including the EU, which helps to fund Egypt's courts - must also call urgently on Egypt to end its use of patently illegal mass trials," she said. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar welcomed Halawa's acquittal and said the case had been an "extraordinarily protracted" one. "Now that Ibrahim has been cleared of all charges, I expect he will be released as soon as possible and can return home to his family. The government will facilitate his return home at the earliest opportunity," Varadkar said in a statement. 'Prisoner of conscience' The court on Monday sentenced 43 defendants to life imprisonment (25 years under Egyptian law), 399 defendants were sentenced to between five and 15 years, and 52 were acquitted, including Halawa. Najia Bounaim, North Africa research director at Amnesty International , said Ibrahim was "a prisoner of conscience who should never have been detained in the first place". "Ibrahim Halawa's acquittal puts an end to the gross injustice in his case. However, it is utterly disgraceful that at the same time the Egyptian authorities have handed out heavy sentences to 442 others after sham proceedings in a mass trial that flouted the most basic standards of a fair trial, while security forces who used excessive and lethal force during protests that day have escaped unpunished," she said.

Halawa's case highlighted human rights abuses carried out by the Egyptian government, Foa said. "Ireland and the international community should call on Egypt to end these abuses," she said. Arrested in August 2013 along with hundreds more, the tall, crop-haired student went on trial for an alleged role in violence during protests in Cairo - charges he, witnesses, and his lawyers, all denied. During his time in jail, Halawa launched a hunger strike to protest his detention. Egyptian officials repeatedly denied Halawa's health was ever at risk, but his family members and Irish politicians supporting his case claimed he was near suicide at one point.

'We're staying no matter what they do,' says Rania Elias, director of the Yabous Cultural Centre [Mersiha Gadzo/Al Jazeera] Occupied East Jerusalem - Mazen Jabari was heading towards the Yabous Cultural Centre in occupied East Jerusalem to deliver a presentation on al-Aqsa Mosque , when he received a phone call advising him not to come. "The Israeli police stormed the place, and they're looking ... to speak with you," Jabari, a researcher with the Arab Studies Society NGO, recalled the Yabous Cultural Centre's director telling him in late August. Israeli police and intelligence had arrived an hour before the scheduled start of the al-Aqsa lecture - which was intended to raise questions about Jordan's custodianship over the holy site - and ordered the centre's director, Rania Elias, to shut it down, claiming it had been organised by the "terrorist organisation" Hamas . "This has nothing to do with Hamas or any political party," Elias told Al Jazeera. "These research papers are presented in newspapers, on social media, on TV and so on. It is discussed openly." Jabari believes the event was cancelled because Israeli authorities did not want certain information disseminated to the public: "The two governments [of Israel and Jordan] have an interest not to discuss this type of information in front of the Palestinian public in Jerusalem after what happened in July," he said, referring to recent protests over Israeli measures of control at al-Aqsa. Mazen Jabari believes his event was cancelled because Israel did not want certain information about al-Aqsa Mosque to come under public scrutiny [Mersiha Gadzo/Al Jazeera] The cancellation and closure of the Yabous event, however, is by no means an isolated case. According to the Jerusalem-based Civic Coalition for Palestinian Rights (CCPRJ), it is part of Israel's broader effort to Judaise the city . Since 2001, the group found, Israeli authorities have temporarily or permanently closed at least 35 Palestinian public institutions and NGOs in occupied East Jerusalem. {articleGUID} Among them are the think-tank Orient House, which served as the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the 1980s and 90s; the Palestinian National Theatre; the Jerusalem Chamber of Commerce; the Agricultural and Industrial Chamber of Commerce; the Arab Studies Society; the Higher Council of Tourism; and the European Union's Small Projects Centre. Orient House was forced to close its premises in occupied East Jerusalem in 2001, and Israeli authorities have renewed the closure every six months, prompting the think-tank to move its offices to the neighbourhood of Beit Hanina. The Arab Studies Society and the Jerusalem Chamber of Commerce have also been forced to relocate. Rights groups have condemned the closure of Palestinian institutions as a violation of international law and an attempt to stifle Palestinian political, social, cultural and economic development in occupied East Jerusalem. "The UN Human Rights Committee has repeatedly criticised Israeli counterterrorism legislation for the vagueness of definitions, ambiguity of language and evidentiary presumptions," the CCPRJ said in a statement . "It is a policy of persecution carried out against the organised Palestinian society, which continues to resist the myriad of arbitrary and discriminatory laws, policies and measures whereby Israel seeks to permanently annex the occupied Palestinian city and transform it into a predominantly Jewish-Israeli area." Health unions have not been exempt from the closures. In 2015, Israeli police and intelligence ordered the Palestinian Health Union in occupied East Jerusalem to close for a year, citing Israel's 1948 Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance, which allows the military to "close any place serving a terrorist organisation or its members ... as a place of action, meeting, propaganda or storage". "For any closure, they use this excuse of security ... Usually, they never give any explanation or details. They never charge anybody," CCPRJ director Zakaria Odeh said, noting such moves are " part of putting pressure on people in the city by closing institutions that provide support to the population in different ways". {articleGUID} The Palestinian Health Union provides health services for Palestinian children and youth. Since 1990, it has operated a health programme in more than 60 schools, delivering medical check-ups and other services for students. "[Organisations that work] in education, culture, tourism, health - they are doing the job of the government by themselves. They are protecting the Palestinians in the city; they are protecting the Palestinian identity and preserving our existence here. For [Israeli authorities], they don't want to see this," Elias said. NGOs are tasked with providing services for Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem since, under the Oslo Accords , the Palestinian Authority is not allowed to operate in Jerusalem . In addition to the incident involving Jabari's lecture, Israeli authorities have targeted the Yabous Cultural Centre on multiple previous occasions. The Yabous Cultural Centre is one of the largest and most active Palestinian cultural NGOs in Jerusalem [Mersiha Gadzo/Al Jazeera] In 2014, the Al Quds Centre for Legal Advice had planned an open discussion on civil service at the centre, but Israeli authorities shut it down over allegations that it was organised by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a Palestinian political party that Israel considers a "terrorist" group. Yabous' annual literature festival was shut down in 2009 , and a few years later, a session on the Arab Spring was also cancelled. "[The closures are done] so people feel hopeless to the situation around them," Elias said, noting that the situation for Palestinian institutions has never been more precarious. Since the start of 2017, they are also being pressured financially, she said. Dozens of Palestinian organisations in occupied East Jerusalem - including Yabous and al-Hoash Palestinian Art Court - have received phone calls from a local bank, informing them that they need to close their accounts, said lawyer Mazen Qupty, who represents al-Hoash. "Every day, it's becoming more difficult even to breathe in this city. They are creative in creating these rules and regulations that make it difficult for you to stay here," Elias said. "I always say we work in Jerusalem to pay [the Israelis] money. It's amazing how much they're asking between property taxation, insurance and this system that they're creating in Jerusalem, which is making our life in Jerusalem very difficult to cope with." {articleGUID} This past summer, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to adopt another bill to limit foreign funding of NGOs in Israel. Yabous, along with the Arab Studies Society, has received much of its funding from abroad, including from the United Nations Development Programme and the EU. Despite the obstacles, Jabari and Elias say they will continue to do their work, with Jabari planning to hold another event at a different location in the future to present his research paper on al-Aqsa. "On the contrary, this will encourage us to work more; it will give us more strength and energy," Elias said. "We're not leaving Jerusalem; we're staying no matter what they do."

'We have to think about the future of our children, grandchildren, our women - where can they live?' [Mersiha Gadzo/Al Jazeera] Silwan, Occupied East Jerusalem - For four hours, Abdul Karim Abu Sneina watched as a pair of bulldozers razed the two homes that he had built, leaving a dozen of his family members - including seven children - homeless. "Where can I live? There's no place for us to live," Abu Sneina said after the August demolition, standing in front of a mound of broken bricks and iron scraps. Residents of al-Bustan neighbourhood in the valley of Silwan had expected the bulldozers, fearing retaliation for their participation in summer protests that pressured Israeli authorities to remove newly installed metal detectors at al-Aqsa Mosque compound. "Whenever Palestinians start to get more comfortable, the [Israeli] government looks to seize an opportunity for retaliation afterwards," Abu Sneina told Al Jazeera, noting that he quickly rebuilt a temporary shelter for his family, but bulldozers returned days later to demolish it as well. He remains determined to keep rebuilding: "In 1967, the Israelis kicked my family out of their home in Jorat al-Anab [in West Jerusalem], and they moved here to Silwan. I was born here. We have to think about the future of our children, grandchildren, our women - where can they live? We're going to be homeless. I have to rebuild my home." INTERACTIVE: Broken Homes - A record year of Israeli demolitions More than 1,000 al-Bustan residents have been protesting against home demolitions for more than a decade, but they have exhausted all legal options to save their homes. According to lawyer Ziad Kawar, who represents al-Bustan's residents, all 100 residential structures in al-Bustan have been slated for demolition to make way for "King's David's Garden" archaeological tourism park, comprising restaurants, artists' studios and local art shops, among other attractions. Some Israelis claim this location was the site of the biblical garden of King David, but this claim is disputed . The battle against home demolitions in this area began decades ago, after the city's 1976 master plan designated al-Bustan valley as green space, prohibiting any kind of construction by residents. Today, the area is crowded with more than 90 residential structures, most of them built without permits and therefore deemed "illegal". Palestinians are rarely able to obtain building permits; Israeli authorities approve less than two percent of requests. An estimated 60,000 Palestinians are at risk of having their homes demolished in occupied East Jerusalem , while another 43,000 housing units are needed to address the housing shortage. Al-Bustan residents received a slew of demolition orders in 2005, and the first two homes were destroyed later that year. Residents mobilised and submitted alternative plans for the development of the neighbourhood in conjunction with Israeli planning authorities, but the District Planning Authority rejected their proposal, asserting that the area must remain an open space due to its important location. In 2009, the municipality proposed that residents voluntarily move to Beit Hanina in northern East Jerusalem, but they declined. According to Fahri Abu Diab, the head of al-Bustan's popular committee, Abu Sneina's home was the 11th residential structure to be demolished since 2005. Like many others, Abu Diab tried applying for a building permit, but it was rejected and he was told that the valley was "a green area where thousands of years ago King David walked". Al-Bustan residents have spread awareness of their plight over the years, including a 2010 protest that drew such high-profile attendees as former US President Jimmy Carter and former Irish President Mary Robinson. Residents of al-Bustan believe the international attention helped to stave off many of the demolition orders for years, but they are worried their luck is running out. "During the prayer protests at al-Aqsa , the Palestinian people's motivation increased. So [Israeli soldiers and settlers] retaliated by arresting and beating people, confiscating and demolishing homes. It's a strategy to break the people's motivation ... They're destroying Jerusalem," Abu Sneina said. The day he lost his home, Israeli authorities also demolished two large apartment buildings, a tire repair shop, a car sale lot, a store and an agricultural business in four other East Jerusalem neighbourhoods. According to a United Nations report , occupied East Jerusalem accounts for a third of the 321 Palestinian-owned structures demolished this year across the West Bank - a number almost as high as the total for 2016, a record year of home demolitions. INTERACTIVE: Building the occupation According to human rights group B'Tselem, Israel plans to develop eight national parks in Palestinian communities in occupied East Jerusalem, mostly neighbouring the Old City walls. "The unusually large number of national parks declared in Jerusalem and the fact that some are located in areas devoid of any significant archaeological findings or natural treasures, indicate that that the designation of these areas as parks is not meant simply to protect nature, landscape and heritage," B'Tselem wrote in a report. "These parks are also, perhaps mainly, meant to promote political agendas such as maintaining a Jewish majority in Jerusalem." Meanwhile, the protest tent in al-Bustan, described by the municipality as a "hotbed of violence", remains standing despite being demolished several times by the Israeli military and set on fire by Jewish settlers, according to Abu Sneina. "If I don't rebuild my home, what's the solution?" he asked. "For those who see what's happening here in Jerusalem [and don't speak up], isn't their silence also a crime?"

RenderPagesVideo('5629922920001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); This week, Palestinians around the world are marking 100 years since the Balfour Declaration was issued on November 2, 1917. The declaration turned the Zionist aim of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine into a reality when Britain publicly pledged to establish "a national home for the Jewish people" there. The pledge is generally viewed as one of the main catalysts of the Nakba - the ethnic cleansing of Palestine in 1948 - and the conflict that ensued with the Zionist state of Israel . It is regarded as one of the most controversial and contested documents in the modern history of the Arab world and has puzzled historians for decades. What is the Balfour Declaration? The Balfour Declaration ("Balfour's promise" in Arabic) was a public pledge by Britain in 1917 declaring its aim to establish "a national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine. The statement came in the form of a letter from Britain's then-foreign secretary, Arthur Balfour, addressed to Lionel Walter Rothschild, a figurehead of the British Jewish community. It was made during World War I (1914-1918) and was included in the terms of the British Mandate for Palestine after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. {articleGUID} The so-called mandate system, set up by the Allied powers, was a thinly veiled form of colonialism and occupation. The system transferred rule from the territories that were previously controlled by the powers defeated in the war - Germany , Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria - to the victors. The declared aim of the mandate system was to allow the winners of the war to administer the newly emerging states until they could become independent. The case of Palestine, however, was unique. Unlike the rest of the post-war mandates, the main goal of the British Mandate there was to create the conditions for the establishment of a Jewish "national home" - where Jews constituted less than 10 percent of the population at the time. Upon the start of the mandate, the British began to facilitate the immigration of European Jews to Palestine. Between 1922 and 1935, the Jewish population rose from nine percent to nearly 27 percent of the total population. What the map of #Palestine looked like 100 years ago A post shared by AJ Labs (@aj_labs) onOct 28, 2017 at 9:50pm PDT // <![CDATA[ // ]]]] > Though the Balfour Declaration included the caveat that "nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine", the British mandate was set up in a way to equip Jews with the tools to establish self-rule, at the expense of the Palestinian Arabs. Why was it controversial? The document was controversial for several reasons. Firstly, it was, in the words of the late Palestinian-American academic Edward Said, "made by a European power … about a non-European territory … in a flat disregard of both the presence and wishes of the native majority resident in that territory". In essence, the Balfour Declaration promised Jews a land where the natives made up more than 90 percent of the population. {articleGUID} Secondly, the declaration was one of three conflicting wartime promises made by the British. When it was released, Britain had already promised the Arabs independence from the Ottoman Empire in the 1915 Hussein-McMahon correspondence. The British also promised the French, in a separate treaty known as 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement , that the majority of Palestine would be under international administration, while the rest of the region would be split between the two colonial powers after the war. The declaration, however, meant that Palestine would come under British occupation and that the Palestinian Arabs who lived there would not gain independence. Finally, the declaration introduced a notion that was reportedly unprecedented in international law - that of a "national home". The use of the vague term "national home" for the Jewish people, as opposed to "state", left the meaning open to interpretation. Earlier drafts of the document used the phrase "the reconstitution of Palestine as a Jewish State", but that was later changed. In a meeting with Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann in 1922, however, Arthur Balfour and then-Prime Minister David Lloyd George reportedly said the Balfour Declaration "always meant an eventual Jewish state". Why was it issued? {articleGUID} The question of why the Balfour Declaration was issued has been a subject of debate for decades, with historians using different sources to suggest various explanations. While some argue that many in the British government at the time were Zionists themselves, others say the declaration was issued out of an anti-Semitic reasoning, that giving Palestine to the Jews would be a solution to the "Jewish problem". In mainstream academia, however, there are a set of reasons over which there is a general consensus: Control over Palestine was a strategic imperial interest to keep Egypt and the Suez Canal within Britain's sphere of influence Britain had to side with the Zionists to rally support among Jews in the United States and Russia , hoping they could encourage their governments to stay in the war until victory Intense Zionist lobbying and strong connections between the Zionist community in Britain and the British government; some of the officials in the government were Zionists themselves Jews were being persecuted in Europe and the British government was sympathetic to their suffering How was it received by Palestinians and Arabs? In 1919, then-US President Woodrow Wilson appointed a commission to look into public opinion on the mandatory system in Syria and Palestine. The investigation was known as the King-Crane commission. It found that the majority of Palestinians expressed a strong opposition to Zionism, leading the conductors of the commission to advise a modification of the mandate's goal. The late Awni Abd al-Hadi, a Palestinian political figure and nationalist, condemned the Balfour Declaration in his memoirs, saying it was made by an English foreigner who had no claim to Palestine, to a foreign Jew who had no right to it. {articleGUID} In 1920, the Third Palestinian Congress in Haifa decried the British government's plans to support the Zionist project and rejected the declaration as a violation of international law and of the rights of the indigenous population. However, the other important source for insight into Palestinian opinion on the declaration - the press - was closed down by the Ottomans at the start of the war in 1914 and only began to reappear in 1919, but under British military censorship. In November 1919, when the al-Istiqlal al-Arabi (Arab independence) newspaper, based in Damascus, was reopened, one article said in response to a public speech by Herbert Samuel, a Jewish cabinet minister, in London on the second anniversary of the Balfour Declaration: "Our country is Arab, Palestine is Arab, and Palestine must remain Arab." Even prior to the Balfour Declaration and the British Mandate, pan-Arab newspapers warned against the motives of the Zionist movement and its potential outcomes in displacing Palestinians from their land. Khalil Sakakini, a Jerusalemite writer and teacher, described Palestine in the immediate aftermath of the war as follows: "A nation which has long been in the depths of sleep only awakes if it is rudely shaken by events, and only arises little by little … This was the situation of Palestine, which for many centuries has been in the deepest sleep, until it was shaken by the great war, shocked by the Zionist movement, and violated by the illegal policy [of the British], and it awoke, little by little." Increased Jewish immigration under the mandate created tensions and violence between the Palestinian Arabs and the European Jews. One of the first popular responses to British actions was the Nebi Musa revolt in 1920 that led to the killing of four Palestinian Arabs and five immigrant Jews. Who else was behind it? While Britain is generally held responsible for the Balfour Declaration, it is important to note that the statement would not have been made without prior approval from the other Allied powers during World War I. In a War Cabinet meeting in September 1917, British ministers decided that "the views of President Wilson should be obtained before any declaration was made". Indeed, according to the cabinet's minutes on October 4, the ministers recalled Arthur Balfour confirming that Wilson was "extremely favourable to the movement". France was also involved and announced its support prior to the issuing of the Balfour Declaration. A May 1917 letter from Jules Cambon, a French diplomat, to Nahum Sokolow, a Polish Zionist, expressed the sympathetic views of the French government towards "Jewish colonisation in Palestine". {articleGUID} "[I]t would be a deed of justice and of reparation to assist, by the protection of the Allied Powers, in the renaissance of the Jewish nationality in that Land from which the people of Israel were exiled so many centuries ago," stated the letter, which was seen as a precursor to the Balfour Declaration. What impact did it have on Palestinians? The Balfour Declaration is widely seen as the precursor to the 1948 Palestinian Nakba when Zionist armed groups, who were trained by the British, forcibly expelled more than 750,000 Palestinians from their homeland. Despite some opposition within the War Cabinet predicting that such an outcome was probable, the British government still chose to issue the declaration. While it is difficult to imply that the developments in Palestine today can be traced back to the Balfour Declaration, there is no doubt that the British Mandate created the conditions for the Jewish minority to gain superiority in Palestine and build a state for themselves at the expense of the Palestinian Arabs. {articleGUID} When the British decided to terminate their mandate in 1947 and transfer the question of Palestine to the United Nations , the Jews already had an army that was formed out of the armed paramilitary groups trained and created to fight side by side with the British in World War II. More importantly, the British allowed the Jews to establish self-governing institutions, such as the Jewish Agency, to prepare themselves for a state when it came to it, while the Palestinians were forbidden from doing so - paving the way for the 1948 ethnic cleansing of Palestine.

Three Mizrahi Jews reading a copy of the Hebrew Bible at a Jewish refugee camp, March 3, 1949 [AP] The State of Israel was conceived at the turn of the 20th century in Eastern Europe by a group of elite European Jews who launched a movement called Zionism that sought to establish a physical nation state exclusive to Jews. It was a typical settler colonial enterprise, complete with the narrative of a divine mandate and a non-existent or savage indigenous population, central to which was the myth that Jews of the world formed a singular people, favored by God, who were returning to their singular place of origin - Palestine - after a three thousand year absence.

Thus, recruitment of Jews from the surrounding Arab world was a necessary inconvenience. They did so through propaganda and by creating false flag terror incidents (bombing of synagogues or Jewish centres) in order provoke an exodus of Arab Jews. A prime example of this happened in Iraq , where the oldest Jewish community in the world had lived for millennia as contributing members of Iraqi society, and who prospered, contributed to the arts and the economy, and participated in government. But these Jews were not embraced as brethren by European Zionists. Zionism was decidedly colonial, and that meant that Jews of the Arab world were seen as incomplete, barbaric, dirty, uncivilised. Za'ev Jabotinsky, one of the forefathers of Zionism said, "We Jews have nothing in common with what is called the Orient , thank God. To the extent that our uneducated masses [Arab Jews] have ancient spiritual traditions and laws that call the Orient, they must be weaned away from them, and this is in fact what we are doing in every decent school, what life itself is doing with great success. We are going in Palestine, first for our national convenience, [second] to sweep out thoroughly all traces of the Oriental soul ." READ MORE: The shocking story of Israel's disappeared babies A multitude of programs and protocols were implemented towards this goal. One of the most egregious was a large initiative of stealing the babies of Arab Jews and giving them to be raised by European Jews. But the larger efforts were simple propaganda campaigns that were implemented in schools, communities, and national projects. The word Mizrahim, from the Hebrew and Arabic words meaning "those of the East," was popularised to lump all of these peoples of different nations into a single miscellaneous category that erased their individual ancient histories and cultures that spanned thousands of years of life and tradition, replete with countless and invaluable achievements in their respective nations. In essence, it was a project to strip ancient peoples of their identities, which was not unlike what they tried to do to Palestinians. Zionists were trying to create a new nation with a unified people. So, they could not abide allowing parts of this population to continue to identify as Iraqi, Moroccan, Persian, Tunisian, and so on, and certainly not as Arab Jews. At the same time, the racist impulses of colonialism could not abide putting these people on par with Jews of Europe. They could not simply be Jews in the new Jewish state. Thus, the word Mizrahim, from the Hebrew and Arabic words meaning "those of the East," was popularised to lump all of these peoples of different nations into a single miscellaneous category that erased their individual ancient histories and cultures that spanned thousands of years of life and tradition, replete with countless and invaluable achievements in their respective nations. Before Israel, Jews of Iraq identified as Iraqi, of Morocco as Moroccan, of Tunisia as Tunisian, of Iran as Persian, of Syria as Syrian, of Egypt as Egyptian, and of Palestine as Palestinian. They spoke Arabic, ate the same foods as their Christian and Muslim compatriots, celebrated and partook in the same national events and traditions, lived by the same social protocols, and moved through their respective cultures as other natives did. And despite the similarities of their cultures, Tunisians were distinct from Egyptians, who were both distinct from Iraqis, who were distinct from Moroccans, etc. But Israel collapsed them all under a single identity, which was to be distinguished only from Ashkenazis, European Jews, who were higher up on the social order, and, of course, from non-Jewish Palestinians and Arabs, who were to be despised. The level of their resulting self-hate can be measured in the heightened cruelty they practise against Palestinians. However, as Zionists would learn from Palestinians, erasing the identity of others is not an easy task. Memory is stubborn, and roots will continue to tug at humans long after they've been uprooted. Arab Jews continued to speak Arabic at home, to dance to Arabic music, eat Arab food, and dream of once again seeing the mountains, rivers, architecture, libraries, and colours of Persia, Babylon, North Africa and the Levant. READ MORE: Israel urged to apologise for disappeared babies Israel has moved away slightly from early Zionism's contempt for our part of the world. And while it remains a colonial project, bent on erasing the native Palestinian presence, their social efforts are more focused on "indigenising" themselves to the land. The obstinacy of Arab Jews in clinging to their cultural roots has provided a convenient avenue to lay claim to regional indigenous culture. So now, Arab foods (like falafel, hummus, shakshouka), traditional Arab clothing (like tatreez, galabiyas, keffiyehs), and Arab folkloric dances are all being rebranded as "Israeli," yet another phase of colonial renaming, and they use the rebranded Arab Jews to justify their claim.

The provocative photos and footage of Israeli flags in Erbil and Kirkuk, as painful as they are to us, should not lead to the isolation or demonisation of the Kurds, writes Andoni [Reuters] So far, Israel has been the only state to support the Kurdish secession from Iraq , even celebrating the outcome of the September 25 referendum, in which an overwhelming majority of Iraqi Kurds voted for breaking away from Baghdad. Israeli enthusiasm for Kurdish independence has little to do with compassion for the Kurds, whether in Iraq or elsewhere, and more to do with geopolitical interests. In fact, it is beyond ironic for Israel, a state founded and sustained on brutal military occupation and apartheid, to champion freedom for the Kurds or any group of people in the world.

Also, Israel has never supported any other national liberation movement in its history. Israel's support for an independent Kurdish state is solely motivated by geopolitical reasons. Israel wants to secure the flow of oil supplies from the Kurdish Autonomous Region, but more importantly, it wants to build a pro-Israeli entity that cuts through the Arab World. Israel already imports 77 percent of its oil supplies from Iraq's Kurdish region. These imports are extremely important for the Zionist state, as it does not have access to the natural resources of oil-rich Gulf states. Also, Israel believes that an independent Kurdish state can serve as a potential foothold for the Israeli military and intelligence, giving the country leverage against Iran , Syria and Iraq. The creation of an independent Kurdish state in the Middle East fits perfectly into Oded Yion's 1982 plan for the Middle East, which advocated the split up of the Arab World along ethnic and sectarian lines to strengthen Israel and expand its hegemony. The Israeli backing of the Kurdish secession from Iraq is further igniting Arabs' suspicions that such a move would be a concrete step towards the disintegration of the Arab World, something that could trigger clashes and even wars. READ MORE: Iraqi Kurds overwhelmingly back split from Baghdad Israel perceives a future Kurdish state as a potential non-Arab ally in the region - an ally that is not directly affected by the Palestinian cause. Since its inception, Israel has followed the "alliance of the peripheries" strategy, conceived by its first Prime Minister David Ben Gurion, to strengthen Israel's ties with non-Arab Muslim states or groups in the region, in order to break the isolation of the Zionist state. As part of this doctrine, Israel reached out to Kurdish leader Mustafa Barzani, the father of current Kurdish President Masoud Barzani, several times throughout his time in office. As a result of these efforts, Mustafa Barzani visited Israel twice, once in 1968 and once in 1973. Yet, these efforts did not amount to much. Kurds did not show any strong support for Israel or animosity towards the Palestinians. There is no doubt that the tyranny of the Arab states and their failure to adequately deal with Kurdish rights pushed new generations of Kurds away from the Arab World and into the lap of Israel. Thus the scene of Israeli flags flying in Kurdish towns during the referendum along with reported slogans such as "We are the second Israel" suggest an alteration of the Kurdish political culture and an apparent break from the past when Kurdish fighters trained and fought alongside members of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in Beirut in the late sixties, seventies and early eighties. Since then Israel has succeeded, with the help of Kurdish leaders like President Masoud Barzani, to infiltrate Kurdish society and end a once strong Kurdish association with the Palestinian cause. There is no doubt that the tyranny of the Arab states and their failure to adequately deal with Kurdish rights pushed new generations of Kurds away from the Arab World and into the lap of Israel. As Iraq plummeted into sectarian violence and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) group started its campaign of terror, rape and grisly atrocities, a new fault line between the Kurds and the rest of the Arab world has emerged. But the two main turning points in Kurdish-Arab relations were the 1991 Western-imposed no-fly zone that went beyond protecting the Kurdish population into tearing the Kurdish region from Iraq and the 2003 US-led invasion and occupation of Iraq. The catastrophic invasion triggered internal strife that further alienated the Kurds from the rest of the country and allowed for increased Israeli presence in the area. In its declared and enthusiastic support for Kurdish independence, Israel has openly tried to draw similarities between its history and the Kurdish struggle for statehood. By doing so, Israel has been trying to erase the parallels between the Kurdish and Palestinian struggles against colonialism and oppression. READ MORE: Erdogan, Rouhani united in opposition to Kurdish state The new revisionist story, in the words of former Likud Minister Gideon Saar, is that the Kurds and the Jews are two minority groups in the Middle East, but that the Jews have achieved statehood while the Kurds have not. "The Kurds have been and will continue to be reliable and long-term allies of Israel since they are, like us, a minority group in the region," he said. Such interpretation of history is not only self-serving, but false. Kurds have been an integral and authentic part of the region and of the Arab World - they are not colonisers, and they did not use military power to expropriate lands or dispossess people. While there has always been a Jewish minority in historical Palestine and the Arab World, Zionism was not part of an indigenous movement, but was born in Europe to address what was called the "Jewish question" triggered by institutionalised persecution of and pogroms committed against Jews across Europe in the first half of the 20th century.

(25:00) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Zionism did not provide a vision for ending discrimination against European Jews but embarked on a colonialist movement to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine through the forced usurpation of its lands and dispossession of its people. The Israeli attempt to draw parallels between Zionism and the plight of the Kurdish people, whether in Iran, Turkey, Syria or Iraq is blatant propaganda to vindicate its colonial project, its occupation of Palestine and continued crimes against the Palestinians. The provocative photos and footage of Israeli flags in Erbil and Kirkuk, as painful as they are to us, should not lead to the isolation or demonisation of the Kurds. We have to acknowledge the responsibility of Arab states, as well as Iran and Turkey in the historical injustice that was inflicted on the Kurds. Arguments that Kurds are a pawn to Israel and the West ignore the fact that any persecuted minority, regardless of its ethnicity or religion, can fall prey to foreign influence and interference, and we cannot deny their right to self-determination. Arabs are now faced with a very difficult dilemma between supporting the Kurdish right to self-determination, an inalienable right for all people, and resisting Israeli attempts to become dominant in Iraqi Kurdistan. There are no easy answers, but it is important to send a message to the Kurdish people that we support their right to self-determination by increasing ties between Kurdish and Arab political parties, civil societies and intellectuals. We can't afford a break with Kurdistan, neither morally nor strategically. It is time to reach out and be there for the Kurds. We should make sure the Iraqi central government, which has done a dismal job so far, does not attempt to oppress and control the Kurdish people, but rather that it negotiate with Kurdish leaders on the basis of respect and equality. Regardless of what we think of Masoud Barzani and his corruption, we should remember that it is the Kurdish people who we should reach out to. After all, many Arab leaders are no different from Barzani, and his failings do not erase the Kurdish people's importance in the region - Kurds are a people whose culture and contributions have enriched the Arab World for centuries. It is not too late to prevent a break between Kurds and Arabs. It is important to counter Israel's destructive plans for the region, but turning Kurds into an enemy of the Arab world, just because they are seeking self-determination, is wrong and self-defeating. It's time for us to stop repeating the phrase "Kurdistan is a second Israel", even though some Kurds have been using it. Kurdistan is not a new Israel, and it will never be.

Palestinians parade during celebrations after Hamas said it reached a deal with Palestinian rival Fatah, in Gaza City October 12, 2017. [Reuters/Suhaib Salem] [Reuters] Last week's talks between Fatah and Hamas for a unity government have encouraged mild optimism among Palestinians that this time negotiations could succeed. In spite of the positive tone of the statement released after the meeting in Cairo on October 10, there are still a number of difficult issues to negotiate which could impede the success of the reconciliation efforts. The two parties still have to resolve who will control Gaza in the future, what will become of Hamas' military wing, and what will happen with Gaza's government employees. Control over Gaza Hamas took over Gaza in 2007 after clashing with and expelling Fatah , which refused to recognise its victory in the 2006 elections. Subsequently, Hamas had to set up its own mechanisms and bodies to administer the Gaza Strip . Currently, Hamas dominates every aspect of life in Gaza. It controls education, administers healthcare provision and hospitals, collects taxes from businesses and households, provides security and manages the border crossings with Egypt and Israel. But what will happen if and when the Palestinian minister of interior arrives in Gaza to put in place the same security coordination with Israel that is currently in place in the West Bank? In other words, over the past 10 years, Hamas has set up a full-blown state apparatus, separate from the Palestinian Authority (PA). So what will happen to all its institutions? Will they disappear overnight, to be replaced by authorities reporting to the head of the PA in Ramallah? Will the disbanding be dealt with on one front at a time or will there be a wholesale handover of control over Gaza? What will happen to Hamas loyalists within these institutions? It is clear that the lack of a detailed vision of how to proceed with the unification will create chaos and piecemeal attempts to deal with individual issues. Without a structure agreed upon by the heads of both sides, unification attempts can easily fail. Will Hamas disarm? PA President Mahmoud Abbas has said more than once that the end goal of reconciliation is to establish the PA's full administrative control over Gaza. In early October he declared that in the Palestinian lands there needs to be "one power, one law, and one security". In addition, the fact that the US , Israel and regional powers have removed their objections to this reconciliation - each for their own reasons - should not be taken to mean that they will be silent indefinitely about the arms stockpiles in Gaza. The weapons belong to various arms of the resistance, including Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and Popular Resistance Committees. Hamas for its part has announced, and continues to affirm, that the future of its armed wing is not subject to the reconciliation negotiations and that it will not accept sacrificing it in order to consolidate the reconciliation government in Gaza. This was among a number of other statements Hamas made aiming to reassure its cadres, who have sacrificed a great deal to stockpile these weapons. {articleGUID} Recognising how problematic this issue is for Hamas, the PA and the Egyptians - the sponsors of the reconciliation - have hinted that they will leave the discussion of this matter to a later stage of the negotiations for fear of creating an unnecessary stalemate. But what will happen if and when the Palestinian minister of interior arrives in Gaza to put in place the same security coordination with Israel that is currently in place in the West Bank? Will Hamas allow that to happen? The security coordination that the PA would like to transfer to Gaza to establish its government there may mean that Israeli military vehicles would enter the Strip, even if only on the periphery. And it would mean that Palestinian security would have to inform its Israeli counterparts of any breaches of border security. Israeli security would inform its Palestinian counterpart of any workshops manufacturing weapons in Gaza, which would have to be broken up and their members arrested. All these foreseen and unforeseen events are nightmare scenarios for Hamas. Is the movement prepared for them or is it hoping to postpone them indefinitely? If indeed the PA takes over security provision in Gaza, it will also take accountability from Hamas for Israeli incursions on Gaza's border, Israeli air attacks, and the harassment of Gaza fishermen by the Israeli navy. For a long time these issues were an embarrassment to Hamas because it wasn't able to deal with them, which was causing growing dissatisfaction among Gaza's residents with their leadership. {articleGUID} Who will pay salaries? The final issue that could potentially derail the unity deal is the fate of almost 50,000 employees within the Hamas-dominated institutions in Gaza. These people support an estimated quarter of a million family members in Gaza. They are the ones who shouldered the burden of administering Gaza's affairs over the past 10 years and will be hostile to any tampering with their employee rights or reduction of their financial and administrative entitlements. Hamas has been adamant during previous negotiations that job security be guaranteed for these employees, and that they be treated as equals to PA employees. It is well known that a number of previous reconciliation and negotiation efforts have come up against the PA refusing to recognise these employees. There have been rumours that there are committees being formed to look into the matter of these employees and to set the government's priorities vis-a-vis its need for them. It is unclear, however, whether job security is indeed something it is considering. So who will be the guarantor for the employees of Gaza, and who will pay their salaries if a settlement of their status is agreed upon? The reality on the ground requires that compromises be presented and that both sides are serious enough to forego party interests and organisational considerations in order to achieve a Palestinian national project, that will not succeed as long as the spectre of division haunts it.

Palestinians stage a protest in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah to mark the 100th anniversary of the Balfour Declaration [Anadolu] The Balfour Declaration is only 67 words long, yet it launched what is broadly seen today as the world's most intractable conflict. The Israeli-Palestinian dispute remains an enduring crisis in the Middle East region 100 years after the declaration was signed on November 2, 1917. Former British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour issued the document to Lord Walter Rothschild, a British Zionist leader, to announce support for the creation of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine. Palestine was then part of the Ottoman Empire and home to a minority Jewish population of nine percent. Al Jazeera spoke with Avi Shlaim, a historian and professor emeritus of international relations at the University of Oxford, about the motivation behind the fateful document and its ongoing legacy. Al Jazeera: Many factors led to the creation of the Balfour Declaration - Zionist, Evangelical, colonial, even anti-Semitism from the British government. What do you think was the main motivation behind this declaration? Avi Shlaim: The school of thought to which I subscribe is the imperialist school of thought. According to this school of thought, the Balfour Declaration was inspired by British imperial considerations and self-interest. In 1917, Britain was engaged in a very tough war, and it wasn't winning the war, so it desperately needed an ally - and in order to gain the support of the Zionists, it should issue a statement in support of a Jewish national home in Palestine. What the map of #Palestine looked like 100 years ago A post shared by AJ Labs (@aj_labs) onOct 28, 2017 at 9:50pm PDT // <![CDATA[ // ]]]] > [Former UK Prime Minister David Lloyd George] had an exaggerated idea of the power and influence of the Jews. He thought that the Jews had covert power worldwide and that they made the wheels of history turn, and therefore, if Britain made this gesture in support of the project, then Britain would acquire a major strategic ally. But this view of the power of the Jews was a misperception, because the reality was that the Jews were an impotent minority and the Zionists were a tiny minority within the minority. Al Jazeera: In the declaration, they promised to protect "civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine", but there was no mention of political rights. How is it that they gave the Jewish people - a minority in Palestine who accounted for nine percent of the population at the time - the right to national self-determination, while denying self-determination to the majority? Shlaim: This shows the absurdity of the Balfour Declaration in denying national rights to the 90 percent majority and granting it to the 10 percent minority. Arthur Balfour knew full well that his declaration contradicted the principle of national self-determination. In short, the Balfour Declaration was a classic colonial document, which completely disregarded the rights and aspirations of the people of the country. {articleGUID} PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Britain had no moral or legal right to promise Palestine to the Jews as a national home. The concept "national home" does not exist under international law, and one Jewish writer, Arthur Koestler, summed it up by saying: One nation, Britain, promised the country of another people, the Palestinians, to a third people, the Jews. Al Jazeera: The declaration is of colossal importance, yet the wording is notoriously vague. They chose to write "a national home for the Jewish people" instead of a "state". What was their vision for Palestine exactly? Shlaim: The Zionists were a tiny group of people, but they were a very effective lobby in Britain … Curious as it may sound, the first draft of what became the Balfour Declaration was submitted by [British Zionist leader] Dr Chaim Weizmann himself, and it revealed the extent of Zionist ambitions. It revealed that what [the Zionists] wanted was not a national home, but a state, and this draft spoke about reconstituting Palestine as a Jewish commonwealth. In other words, not keeping Palestine as it was, as an Arab country and having a national home for the Jews there, but to reorganise the whole country as a Jewish commonwealth. Later on in the draft by other cabinet members, this was turned down from a "Jewish commonwealth" to a "national home" for the Jews in Palestine. But from the beginning, the ultimate aim of the Zionists was a fully fledged independent state in as much of Palestine as possible … Both David Lloyd George and Arthur Balfour, and colonial secretary Winston Churchill, later admitted that from the beginning, it was clear to them that a national home meant a Jewish state. Al Jazeera: You are one of the signatories out of 13,000 to an online petition demanding that the UK government apologise for the Balfour Declaration. What was the response and how does the UK government view the declaration today? Shlaim: The foreign office issued a detailed response to our petition and they completely rejected our idea, and they said that Britain has nothing to apologise for - that, on the contrary, Britain is proud of the part it played in enabling the Jews to establish their own state in Palestine. So the present British government is completely unrepentant. My own view is that the British government has nothing to be proud of. The Balfour Declaration was a shameful and a deplorable gesture and the British government should hang its head in shame. Britain's role did not end with the issuing of this declaration … What had been a British promise to the Zionists became an international treaty. The mandate also entrusted Britain with what's called a "sacred trust of civilisation", [which] was to prepare the country for independence. To prepare the country for independence means to have democracy, to have elections, to have representative institutions. But Britain refused all Palestinian demands for elections, for a national assembly and for a national executive. The cornerstone of British mandatory policy was to prevent representative institutions until the Jews became a majority. So Britain prevented democracy from evolving so long as the Arabs were a majority. It is for this reason that I regard the Balfour Declaration as setting in motion a process that enabled a tiny minority of Zionists to begin the systematic takeover of the entire country. The Balfour Declaration paved the way for the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 and for the ethnic cleansing that accompanied it. There's an Arabic saying: "Something that begins crooked, remains crooked" - and this is true of the British policy towards Palestine. In 1917, British policy began in a very crooked and dishonest way, and Britain's policy today towards Palestine remains crooked and one-sided. The second part of the Balfour Declaration was that a national home will only take place if it didn't compromise the religious and civil rights of the Arabs. And Britain completely failed to honour the second part of the declaration, so its record on Palestine is completely and utterly shameful. This interview has been edited for length.

Israeli settlers harvest Merlot grapes in the vineyards of Kibbutz Tzuba in the occupied West Bank [Jim Hollanders/EPA] A Canadian university lecturer and radio broadcaster has filed a suit in federal court challenging the inaccurate labelling of wines made in illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and exported to Canada as a "Product of Israel". David Kattenburg, a 62-year-old Winnipeg resident and son of Holocaust survivors, had previously submitted a complaint in late March to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) about its labelling procedures, indicating that the grapes used were grown in the occupied West Bank and processed in wineries outside of Israel's formal borders. "These falsely-labelled products trouble me as a consumer," Kattenburg said in July after he filed the original complaint. "Canadians have a right to know that [a product] is made in Israel, if it's made in some other place. This is a matter of concern. They have the right to truthful labelling." Canadian food inspectors initially agreed with Kattenburg's reasoning and issued a directive to liquor stores on July 11 to stop selling wines made in the occupied West Bank. But within hours, the agency backtracked , saying it "regrets" the directive it had issued, noting that the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA) overrode domestic consumer protection laws. "Further clarification of the CIFTA indicates that these wines adhere to the agreement and therefore we can confirm that the products in question can be sold as currently labelled," the food inspection agency said in a statement at the time. {articleGUID} The bilateral trade agreement's provision that the agency references identifies Israel as "the territory where its customs laws are applied," and not its internationally-recognised border. Trade between Israel and Canada has tripled to $1.6bn since the agreement was expanded in 2014. But Kattenburg's lawyer, Ontario-based Dimitri Lascaris, maintains that the Canadian government is "dressing a political decision up as a legal decision" by invoking the trade agreement, which allowed it to bypass the issue of where the grapes were grown. "The [Canada-Israel Trade-Agreement] deals with trade barriers, as do all free trade agreements," Lascaris told Al Jazeera. "You look at the rest of the agreement, there's nothing there about product labelling. A requirement that all products be accurately labelled is not a trade barrier. That's a consumer protection law." When Kattenburg appealed the revoked decision to the agency's Complaints and Appeals Office (CAO) in August, he was informed that the CFIA would stand by its verdict. "Now that the CAO has completed its review and the [food inspection agency] has advised that it is standing by its decision, [Kattenburg] was free to seek a judicial review by the Federal Court of Canada. The Federal Court litigation has now formally begun," Lascaris explained. In a statement to Al Jazeera, CFIA said: "it has no comment as this matter is before the courts". Kattenburg's suit, which was filed last Tuesday, is asking the government to issue an order striking down the legality of the food agency's decision, which he believes is in violation of Canada's regulations on food and drugs, and its laws that set requirements for labels to help consumers make informed purchasing decisions. The Canadian government is saying that "Israel has a right to sell falsely labelled products because they extend its customs law to the occupied territories," Kattenburg said. "This is what the CFIA cited... and [that] definition is at odds with international law." SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Israeli–Palestinian conflict Palestine Israel Canada Middle East
A Palestinian woman reacts at a hospital after her relative was killed near the border between Israel and central Gaza Strip [Mohammed Salem/Reuters] Palestinian armed groups have vowed to respond to Israel's attack on a tunnel in a southern town of the Gaza Strip late on Monday that left at least seven people dead and nine others wounded. "We will exercise our right to respond - this is our duty," Daoud Shehab, a leader in the Islamic Jihad movement, told Al Jazeera, adding that it is a legitimate right of resistance groups to respond. Palestinian media said that the tunnel in Khan Younis had been hit by the Israeli air force. "Reports said Israel fired five missiles at the tunnel that was being dug east of Khan Younis and which Israel claims was leading to its territory," Palestinian news agency Wafa said. People carry the body of a Palestinian who was killed near the border between Israel and central Gaza Strip [Ibraheem Abu Mustafa/Reuters] Israeli officials said that the tunnel near the border wall, which was in the process of being built, was destroyed after being monitored for some time. The Ministry of Health in Gaza officially identified five of those killed as members of the al-Quds Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad movement and two others as members of Hamas' Izz Eddine al-Qassam Brigades. {articleGUID} Hamas decried the attack as the "latest Zionist crime". "Resisting the occupation in all its forms is a natural right guaranteed for our people," the movement said in a statement. Meanwhile, Fatah , the West Bank-based political party of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , called for dialogue between Palestinians to discuss the best response to the Israeli bombardment. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed what he called "breakthrough technology" in dealing with tunnel threats.

The controversial bill would annex to the municipal boundaries of Jerusalem the mega-settlement cities of Maale Adumim, Givat Zeev and Gush Etzion [File: Reuters] Israel has delayed a vote on a controversial bill that would annex illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank to the Israeli-defined boundaries of the city of Jerusalem . The so-called "Greater Jerusalem bill" was meant to be voted on by a ministerial committee on Sunday before going to the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, for approval. The Israeli government did not say why the vote was postponed, but an official speaking on condition of anonymity told the Israeli daily Haaretz that the bill's current version "invites international pressure and involves difficult legal issues". If passed, the legislation would annex to the municipal boundaries of Jerusalem the three major mega-settlement cities of Maale Adumim, Givat Zeev and Gush Etzion, which together house around 140,000 Israelis. It would add the Israelis who live there to the population of Jerusalem, thus allowing them to vote in local elections. Simultaneously, the bill would create "independent municipalities" for several Palestinian neighbourhoods, housing at least 100,000 people, that are part of the Jerusalem municipality but cut off from the city by Israel's separation wall. The purpose is to ensure a Jewish majority in the city of Jerusalem. Palestinian Arabs currently make up some 40 percent of Jerusalem's population and Israeli Jews the remainder. {articleGUID} "The government will approve the Greater Jerusalem law that will strengthen the eternal capital Jerusalem - demographically and geographically," Yoav Kish, the Knesset member who submitted the proposal for the bill, said on Twitter last week before the vote was postponed. Yisrael Katz, another MK who aided in the proposal, said the bill's intent was to "ensure a Jewish majority in the united city and to expand its borders", according to a report in the Jerusalem Post. "It is an unequivocal response to all those in the international community who are questioning the Jewish people's right to Jerusalem," Katz reportedly stated. Breach of international law Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) legislator, said that Israel has been able to push forward such settlement policies due to the "failure of the world's governments to hold Israel accountable for its deliberate violations of international law". "Through its settlement policies, Israel is working to consolidate the occupation, prolong it and maintain it by extending legitimacy to the presence of extremist settlers in the Palestinian territories, and continue to isolate Jerusalem, our occupied capital, and annex it fully, to end the two-state solution," she said. The law is just one of a number of ways in which Israel has worked to consolidate its hold over the city and Judaise it. The settlements set to be incorporated into the Jerusalem boundaries are already connected to the city through roads and bridges built solely for Israeli settlers. {articleGUID} Amany Khalifa, an activist with the local advocacy group Grassroots Jerusalem, says that implementing this law is just the final step towards changes that have already been largely implemented. "This has always been the Zionist policy. They take real steps on the ground, and then they take care of the technical details, such as voting and passing this law," Khalifa told Al Jazeera. On Israel's plans to create "independent municipalities" for the Palestinian neighbourhoods behind the separation wall, Khalifa predicted that the ultimate goal was to strip these Palestinians of their Jerusalem IDs and forbid them from entering the city: "This is all part of Israel's plans to create a 70 percent Jewish majority in the city." Israel occupied East Jerusalem in 1967 and proceeded to effectively annex it, in breach of international law. In 1980, Israel passed the "Jerusalem Law", stating that "Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel", thereby formalising its annexation of East Jerusalem. But the state treats Palestinians and Israelis who are born there differently. Israelis who are born in Jerusalem hold Israeli citizenship, while Palestinians are treated as foreign immigrants and carry a "permanent residency" card that allows them to live in the city. "The objective of demographic control and solidifying a Jewish majority has driven Israeli policy towards Jerusalem for decades," Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine Director at Human Rights Watch, told Al Jazeera. "If passed, the Greater Jerusalem Bill would further entrench the reality of one set of rules for Jews and another for Palestinians." SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Jerusalem Middle East Israel
President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party refuted the claims in a short statement on Monday [File: AP/Virginia Mayo] The Palestinian presidency has refuted a report quoting Israeli politicians as saying that Mahmoud Abbas told them he would not appoint Hamas figures to his cabinet if they did not publicly recognise Israel. Abbas' alleged comments were made in a meeting with 12 ex-Israeli members of parliament who visited him on Sunday in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah, the I sraeli daily Haaretz said in an article published on Monday. In response, Abbas' Fatah party later in the day issued a short statement on its social media platforms, which noted: "The presidency denies the remarks attributed to the president by 'Haaretz'". The statement by Fatah also pointed to reporting by al-Mayadeen news channel, which quoted sources in the Palestinian presidency as saying that Abbas assured the delegation that "the Palestinian government is abiding by international agreements".

Hamas has been the de-facto ruler in the Gaza Strip since 2007 after defeating Abbas' long-dominant Fatah party in parliamentary elections. When Fatah refused to recognise the vote, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in an armed conflict, after which Israel imposed an airtight siege on the territory. The two groups have governed the occupied Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip respectively ever since. The Cairo agreement is meant to usher in a new reality of Palestinian unity based on a power-sharing government. But fundamental differences in ideology and practices - such as Hamas' policy of using armed resistance and choosing not to recognise Israel, compared with Fatah, which cooperates with the Israeli occupation - are some of the key obstacles that could undermine the planned unity, as has occurred in the past. {articleGUID} Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that his government would refuse any diplomatic talks with the unity government if Hamas had any role in it. The United States also chimed in earlier this month, demanding that Hamas disarm if it wants any role in a unity government. But Fatah spokesman Osama Qawasmeh told Al Jazeera that the agreement is an "internal Palestinian matter" that will help bring peace. {articleGUID} "The deal that we signed with Hamas talks about building a Palestinian state on the June 4, 1967, borders - which is in line with international law," Qawasmeh said when asked the comments made by Jason Greenblatt, the US president's special representative for international negotiations. "Israel is trying through its allies to pressure the Palestinian leadership. We declare that our decision is a Palestinian, independent, national decision, and we will not go back to division," he added. SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Hamas Politics Fatah Middle East Israel
'When the visit was over, Majd started shouting in joy, "I saw my dad! I saw my dad"' [Courtesy of Bassem Tahhan] A Palestinian political prisoner was given "10 minutes" to visit his terminally ill teenage son, according to his family. The visit between Rajab Tahhan, who is serving a life sentence, and his son, Majd, who suffers from leukaemia, took place on Monday morning at the Hadassah hospital in Jerusalem. The family said that the Israeli court handling the case placed difficult conditions on them for the visit to happen. "They said that no one is allowed in the same room as Majd when his dad walks in," Bassem Tahhan, the boy's uncle, told Al Jazeera. "This was very difficult because Majd cannot be left alone for a second. He must have an attendant with him 24 hours a day due to his condition." Rajab's story caught media attention when his son's health began to severely deteriorate earlier this month. Majd Tahhan before he was afflicted with leukaemia [Courtesy of Bassem Tahhan] In his 19 years, Majd has spent only two years and eight months in total with his father, who has been repeatedly imprisoned by Israel . According to the family, the father did not recognise his son, whose physical features had changed drastically due to the cancer. "It was a shock for him to see his son like that. He kept asking Majd who his grandfather, uncle, and other family members were to make sure that it was him," said Bassem. "When the visit was over, Majd started shouting in joy, 'I saw my dad! I saw my dad.'" Article 186 Rajab was imprisoned in 1998, when Majd was only four months old, on charges of killing an Israeli settler. He was subsequently released in 2011 under a prisoner exchange deal for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who had been captured by Hamas , the Gaza-based Islamic Resistance Movement. Less than three years later, Israeli forces embarked on a campaign of mass arrests in the Palestinian territories after three Israeli settlers disappeared in the occupied West Bank . Hundreds of Palestinians were rounded up, and many of those who were released in the 2011 deal were rearrested and their sentences reinstated, including Rajab. {articleGUID} Despite determining who was responsible for the three settlers' kidnapping and killing shortly after the incident, Israeli authorities nonetheless kept those who were rearrested in prison. Rajab's life sentence was reinstated in 2014 on "secret evidence", including claims that he violated the conditions placed on him when he was released, according to the family. Article 186 of Israeli military order 1651 allows Israel to rearrest Palestinian prisoners who had been released in an exchange to serve the remainder of their original sentences based on "secret evidence" not accessible to the prisoners or their lawyers. In a 2015 report , the Jerusalem-based Addameer prisoners' rights group said that it found 62 cases since the 2011 exchange deal in which former prisoners were rearrested under Article 186. The use of the article in times of political tension can be classified as collective punishment, a violation of international law, the group noted. "Article 186 is markedly incompatible with international standards and fair trial guarantees ... The use of secret evidence to constantly arrest and detain individuals in occupied Palestine is also critically neglectful in the scope of international human rights law," Addameer said in the report.

'I lost my senses when I heard the news. I lost my mind,' says the father of Mohammad Mousa, pictured in a poster commemorating his death [Courtesy of Mousa family] When 26-year-old Mohammad Mousa left his home in the small village of Deir Ballut in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday morning to renew his driver's license, his family never expected him to return several days later in a plastic body bag. "I remember what my son was wearing and how he smelled that day," Abdallah, Mousa's grieving father, told Al Jazeera. "He finished building his home, he was buying a new vehicle, and after the olive harvest he was planning on getting engaged," he said. "I lost my senses when I heard the news. I lost my mind. Only God can understand how we are feeling right now." Hundreds of Palestinians attended Mousa's funeral on Friday, after Israel released his remains to the family almost four days after he was fatally shot by Israeli forces. Shortly before the incident, Mousa was on his way to Ramallah city with his 33-year-old sister, Latifa. He was driving a car with an Israeli license plate - which is illegal for Palestinians with West Bank ID cards - when the siblings turned a corner and unexpectedly met an Israeli "flying" checkpoint at a junction near Israel's illegal Halamish settlement, adjacent to the village of Nabi Saleh. Local media reported that Israeli forces motioned for Mousa to stop, but he continued past the checkpoint. Israeli forces then opened fire on Mousa's car. 'Shot from the back' Mousa was allegedly shot in the back and succumbed to his wounds at Israel's Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva. Latifa, meanwhile, was struck by a bullet in the shoulder. Although her wounds are moderate, she has remained at Istishari Hospital in Ramallah and underwent surgery on Friday. An Israeli army spokesperson told Al Jazeera that Mousa was killed after driving "in a suspicious manner". "The troops signalled for the vehicle to halt. Upon the driver's continuous advance and failure to comply with the troops' instructions, shots were fired," she said, noting that the incident was under review. Tahseen Elayyan, who heads the monitoring and documentation department at the Palestinian human rights NGO al-Haq, told Al Jazeera that the group's initial investigation revealed that a series of bullets had struck the front and back of the vehicle. The group concluded that Israeli soldiers were continuously shooting at Mousa's vehicle as it passed the checkpoint. Bassam, Mousa's uncle, told Al Jazeera that the full autopsy results have not yet been disclosed. However, based on the wounds on his body, "it's clear he was shot from the back, because the bullet entered the back of his waist and exited from the front." Extrajudicial killings Bassam described Mousa as a kind and simple man who did not involve himself in politics. The village itself is well-known to be non-political, he added, noting that Israeli soldiers had even given the village the nickname "peaceful town". {articleGUID} Abdallah told Al Jazeera that the family would focus on obtaining justice for Mousa through legal avenues, saying the excessive violence was extremely disturbing. "They could have shot the tires to stop the car, but they wanted to kill him," Bassam said. Elayyan said the case is just one among scores of incidents in which Israeli soldiers and officers use lethal force on Palestinians who are not posing an immediate threat. Out of hundreds of cases in which Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces over the past two years, most "could have been easily avoided", he said. Such cases "qualify as extrajudicial killings" and indicate that Israeli forces "follow a shoot to kill policy", Elayyan said - and Israeli forces rarely face accountability. "Even in the very few cases where Israelis appeared before Israeli courts, sentences were not proportionate [to the crime]," he said. Such impunity is the reason his nephew is dead, Bassam said. "The Israelis are never punished. It allows them to treat us as if we are chickens - like we are not human. And this is what gives them the courage to kill us."

Mourners carry the body of a Palestinian Islamic Jihad member during his funeral this week [Reuters] Rescue teams in Gaza have been unable to reach five Palestinians trapped in a tunnel destroyed earlier this week by Israeli forces in the Khan Younis area. Seven Palestinians belonging to Gaza's military brigades of Islamic Jihad and Hamas were killed and a dozen others wounded after Israel blew up a tunnel near the border in the southern Gaza Strip on Monday. Human rights groups have filed a petition to Israel's Supreme Court demanding that the Israeli military allow rescue teams to recover the missing individuals. "The rescue teams managed to come within 300 meters of the border fence but are unable to reach the trapped and missing persons … because of the prohibition imposed by the Israeli army on Palestinians approaching any location that is less than 300 meters from the fence," Muna Haddad, a lawyer with the Adalah Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, wrote in the petition. "Preventing the location and rescue of missing persons in the area currently under Israeli military control is a blatantly illegal policy." No-go zone The Israeli-declared " buffer zone " runs along the Gaza side of the Israeli border. Rescue teams cannot cross the imaginary line and enter the no-go zone for fear of coming under fire from the Israeli army. Yoav Mordechai, Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, has said that Israel "would not allow search efforts in the Gaza Strip security zone without progress on the issue of Israeli POWs [prisoners of war] and MIAs [missing in action]". Israel contends that Hamas has been withholding the bodies of two Israeli soldiers, Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul, who were killed in the last Israeli military offensive on the Gaza Strip in the summer of 2014. Adalah and the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights filed the petition on Thursday on behalf of Hassan Abdel Jalil Sbahi, the father of one of the missing men. The groups accused Mordechai and the Israeli military's southern command chief, Eyal Zamir, of "using the trapped Gazans as bargaining chips". Allowing injured people to receive medical treatment, evacuation of bodies, and immunity for ambulances and medical teams is a basic principle of international humanitarian law and the Fourth Geneva Convention, the petition noted. "Hence, the movement of rescue and medical teams should also be unrestricted, allowing them to search and locate the missing persons without delay, thus increasing their chances of being rescued alive."

Druze in Golan Heights have been caught up in violence across the border [Baz Ratner/Reuters] Israeli security forces say they are "prepared and ready" to prevent the capture of a village in Syria's Quneitra province caught up in clashes between President Bashar al-Assad' s troops and rebels. Violence erupted in Hader, in the Syrian-controlled part of the Golan Heights , after a suicide attack at dawn on Friday killed at least nine people and injured more than 20 others Hader is home to the Druze community , a minority religious sect found in Syria , Israel, the occupied Palestinian territories and Lebanon . Fighting broke out between Syrian government troops and rebel fighters in Hader following the blast, leaving a Druze individual injured in the village of Majdal Shams on the Israel-occupied side. SANA, the official Syrian news agency, said the incident involved a Jabhat al-Nusra (now known as Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham) suicide bomber who detonated a car bomb near houses on the outskirts of Hader, leaving nine people dead and 23 injured. It said the death toll was likely to rise as most of the wounded sustained serious injuries and had to be pulled out of the debris with difficulty in the face of gunfire and shelling by rebel fighters. Warning to Druze Al Jazeera's Harry Fawcett, reporting from West Jerusalem, said: "This attack has been claimed by Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham, better known by its former name Jabhat al-Nusra . "It said it was to trying to end the blockade of villages in its continuing fight against Assad regime forces, and that it didn't intend to harm the property or people of the village. But it warned those Druze villagers against fighting on the side of President Assad." In a statement, the Israeli military said it "is prepared and ready to assist the residents of the village and prevent damage to or the capture of the village Hader out of commitment to the Druze population". Our correspondent said there had been a call from the spiritual leader of the Druze in Israel for all Druze men, including soldiers serving in the Israeli army, to leave their posts to go and defend their brethren across the border. "There was also a demonstration of about 150 people from this Druze village in the Israel-occupied Golan Heights along the border fence," Al Jazeera's Fawcett said. "Because of this, we had this rather unusual statement from the Israeli military, raising the possibility of some kind of direct Israeli on-the-ground military involvement in Syria." The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitor, said the clashes were occurring between "the rebel and Islamic factions against the regime forces and gunmen loyal to them" in areas adjoining Hader. It said that in addition to the exchange of fire and shelling, there was a big explosion caused by the detonation of a booby-trapped vehicle by one of the rebel groups at the entrance to Hader. The SOHR said government troops and allied fighters were among the casualties of Friday's clashes. 'Terrorist attack' SANA said people in the Golan Heights took to the streets in protest against what it called Israeli support for "the terrorist attack launched by Jabhat al-Nusra" on Hader. "Hundreds of Syrians demonstrated inside the occupied territories off the town of Hadar, which has been subjected, since the dawn, to a violent terrorist attack launched by Jabhat al-Nusra and backed by the Israeli occupation entity from al-Tuloul al-Homr area that is adjacent to the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories," SANA reported quoting "local sources in the Occupied Golan". Druze are spread across Syria, Israel, Palestine and Lebanon [Ba z Ratner/Reuters] According to the "local sources", the demonstrators tried to cross the ceasefire line to support the families of Hader "in confronting the terrorist attacks amid reinforcements of the enemy's soldiers to prevent them from advancing". The SANA report said that Israeli forces closed all the roads from occupied Palestinian territories to prevent the arrival of hundreds of Arab citizens in the Golan Heights to support the people in Hader. Responding to some allegations by Druze that Israel was assisting Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham, the Israeli military said: "the allegations of Israeli involvement and assistance to global jihadi elements in the fighting are groundless". Separately, the Israeli military said on Friday it had destroyed a drone operated by the Lebanese group Hezbollah over the Golan Heights. "According to [Israeli army] intelligence, the Iranian-made UAV was operated by Hezbollah, and took off from Damascus Military Airport ... The UAV was shot down by a single Patriot missile ..." Hezbollah fighters have been fighting alongside Assad government forces against rebel groups operating in the Golan area of Syria . Hezbollah has not commented on the Israeli military's claim.

The foundation has around 6,500 records, thousands of hours of reels, and even some wax cylinders, one of the earliest recording mediums [Courtesy of Amar] Listen carefully in Lebanon , and you may grasp the strains of classical Arab music breaking out of the oblivion to which it has been confined for decades. Atop a mountain switchback leading to the stone-built village of Qornet al-Hamra, the Foundation for Arab Music Archiving and Research (Amar) attracts both musicologists and idle music lovers, who can listen to a collection of 78rpm records on a crank handle gramophone from 1922. "The aim of the foundation is to safeguard and [spread] classical Arab music, from the beginning of the recording history at the end of the 19th century, to the beginning of the 1930s," Mounzer el-Hachem, a sound engineer at Amar, tells Al Jazeera, as his eyes follow the sinusoidal wave of the recording of an old 78 he is digitalising. Hachem estimates that the foundation has around 6,500 records, thousands of hours of reels, and even some wax cylinders, one of the earliest recording mediums. While Amar focuses primarily on classical Arab music from Egypt and Syria, it also collects music from Lebanon, Iraq , Yemen and North Africa. "Eventually, we are aiming to collect, restore and digitalise all the music from the Nahda, the Arab Renaissance," he says. 'When I discovered that there was such a deep and innovative musical tradition in our heritage, with women playing a leading role, I was thrilled,' archivist Salwa Jaradat says [Al Jazeera] Nahda, which means "resurrection", refers to a period between the 18th and early 20th centuries, during which the Arab world experienced a political and cultural renewal, influenced by the reforms of the Ottoman Empire and the penetration of Western ideas and economic forces. "The Arab Renaissance was accompanied by a musical revival in the Orient," says Nidaa Abou Mrad, a musicology professor at Beirut's Antonine University. The revival was felt most in Egypt, where singer and composer Abdu al-Hamuli initiated a "hybridisation between the musical tradition from the Levant, called muwashshah ; the urban popular music of Egypt; the musical tradition of the Sufis; as well as aspects of the Ottoman musical tradition", Mrad says. From this intermingling emerged a new musical tradition, handed down orally from master to student, in which improvisation was key. The enjoyment (tarab in Arabic) provoked by its long performances, during which singers would often use witticisms, was such that this musical style is often simply called tarab . READ MORE: Championing culture in Lebanon's south But two events pushed classical Arab music into almost complete oblivion. First was the near destruction of the irreplaceable collections owned by companies that recorded the voices of Arab recording giants such as Yusuf al-Manyalawi and Fathiyya Ahmad. The Arab archives of Odeon vanished in Germany during the second world war; those of the Lebanese company Baidaphon were buried under the rubble of the bombing of Berlin and of the Lebanese civil war and the Arab collection of Pathe was neglected and lost in the 1970s. The second blow came at the Cairo Congress of Arab Music in 1932, where the evolution of Arab music diverged from its classical traditions. "In 1932, during the Cairo Congress of Arab Music, Egyptian musicians and musicologists decided to modernise their music, to safeguard it against the competition of Western music, during a period of growing nationalism," French musicologist Jean Lambert tells Al Jazeera. "They notably introduced musical notation and, progressively, the oral musical tradition vanished. It is this living but forgotten music that Amar Foundation is archiving, so that the public can rediscover its wealth," says Lambert, who recently published a collection of discs from the Cairo Congress . When Kamal Kassar, the founder of Amar, bought the collection of Abd al-Aziz Anani, an Egyptian music lover of the Nahda period, the Lebanese philanthropist was overwhelmed by the historical importance of his purchase. It prompted him to create a foundation to restore and digitalise thousands of discs and reels saved from obscurity. While discovering the treasures of this musical era, what grabbed the attention of Salwa Jaradat, a Palestinian student of Arab music and an archivist at Amar, was the strength of character of its female singers. READ MORE: Beirut's very own Cinema Paradiso "Throughout history, women were more versed in popular songs, notably for weddings and social events. Then came Asma al-Kumthariyya," Jaradat says. "This Tunisian singer began to sing adwar, a type of music reserved for men singers, with such a mastery that she was singing better than men. It was a revolution." Then came Munira al-Mahdiyya, the "Sultana of Tarab", says Jaradat. Not only did Mahdiyya sing adwar , she also performed, disguised as a man, a theatrical role written for a male character. Salwa became enthralled by these personalities, who were soon overshadowed by Umm Koulthum's success. "When I discovered that there was such a deep and innovative musical tradition in our heritage, with women playing a leading role, I was thrilled, but also saddened by the prospect that most of the Arab musicians totally ignore it." For Mustafa Said, director of Amar, the main objective of the foundation is to recreate an audience for this music. "We publish CDs with booklets, a podcast, we organise events in Beirut … The main challenge, for the revival of this musical tradition, is not to find musicians, but listeners."

The Lebanese NGO ABAAD ran a campaign called 'A White Dress Does Not Cover Rape' [File: Hussein Malla/AP] The Lebanese parliament voted this week to abolish an article in the penal code exempting rapists from punishment if they marry their victims, but women's rights activists say this does not go far enough. "For sure, what happened on Wednesday was a positive step, but people in Lebanon wanted to abolish the law and its effect on other articles as well - specifically articles 505 and 518," said Manar Zaiter, a lawyer with the Lebanese Women Democratic Gathering NGO. Articles 505 and 518 stipulate that the rape clause would still apply when sexual assault is committed against a girl between 15 and 18, and there is consent or a prior promise of marriage. "I'm not applauding the efforts of the Lebanese parliament. These are rights, and they were supposed to be granted years ago," Zaiter told Al Jazeera. "They were extremely late in abolishing the law." READ MORE: Meet the woman who pushed to repeal Jordan's rape law Civil society groups in Lebanon have also been fighting to end child marriage in the country. Lebanon has no minimum age for marriage, and its civil code regulating personal status matters lacks such guidelines. A draft law introduced to parliament in March seeks to set a minimum age of 18. According to Zaiter, if articles 505 and 518 were also repealed as per the initial draft amendment brought forward by parliamentarian Elie Kayrouz, it would have been "much easier to then place a cap on the minimum age required for marriage". "Our government is one that is ruled and controlled by the social status quo - it is a sectarian entity," Zaiter said. "But they [parliament] did not vote in favour of the original draft to protect the wishes of parties who claim to be defending Lebanon's social fabric ... The logic and philosophy of the laws that came in the 1940s came with a certain mindset that was there to protect society and public decency and to ensure that prevailing social norms were ratified. But today, we fight for individual rights - we don't fight to protect society and its norms." The Institute for Women's Studies in the Arab World at the Lebanese American University has asserted that gender-based violence is the most "obvious manifestation of gender inequality in Lebanon". Organisations that support victims of sexual assault say they receive more than 2,600 reports of partner violence every year. According to the institute's director, Lina Abirafeh, this can be attributed to the lack of legal provisions that criminalise marital rape. "The Lebanese parliament, at last, took a step towards women's rights … but there is still much to work to do," she told Al Jazeera. "It is not enough to change laws. Everyone in Lebanon must act to change the way society views women … This victory is one small step in the right direction." Kayrouz told Al Jazeera that his party's amendment, proposed in August 2016, aimed to abolish the law and its effects on other provisions "without exceptions". "Following several long sessions of debate, the committee established to examine the proposed amendment did not adopt my original draft," he said. "Instead, it settled for a tweaked version of the amendment that abolished many of the law's effects on other provisions, including kidnapping and adultery, but maintained the law's effect on articles 505 and 518." Although he believes this week's decision was positive and progressive, Kayrouz still believes that more is needed, and he is now considering bringing forward a new motion to abolish the remaining provisions. READ MORE: Activists ramp up pressure on Lebanon's rape law Last month, Jordan and Tunisia abolished similar marriage-rape provisions, while Egypt in 1999 and Morocco in 2014 made similar changes to their penal codes. Danielle Hweik, a legal adviser at ABAAD, a Beirut-based gender-equality NGO, called the move in Lebanon "a huge step forward". The final draft that was voted on in parliament came after months of meetings and discussions, she added. "We heard their [committee members'] views, concerns, and addressed issues together. We worked side-by-side until we reached the draft," she said. "We also launched our media campaign in parallel to the discussions in parliament." PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY People were saying that the law was shameful to our country. Alia Awada, activist and former ABAAD campaign manager The "aggressive", nationwide media and advocacy campaign by ABAAD ran alongside campaigns by other activist groups in the country to raise awareness about the consequences of the law. Women's rights movements and NGOs have been advocating for victims of sexual assault for years, but organisers of the popular ABAAD campaign, called "A White Dress Does Not Cover Rape", say their strategy and timing lined up in this instance. A recent poll conducted to reveal how much the average person knew about the rape law (Article 522) discovered that less than one percent of participants even knew it existed, said Alia Awada, an activist and former ABAAD campaign manager. "People were saying that the law was shameful to our country," Awada said. "[Rape] is a huge crime; we always have to be very aggressive while we're defending the victims and survivors of sexual assault ... Although some said that the law was necessary for a girl's honour, most of the people who saw our campaign, and the media that we met, were very supportive and determined to abolish the law. We had an army of supporters." SOURCE: Al Jazeera ABOUT THE AUTHOR Farah Najjar Farah Najjar is an online producer at Al Jazeera English. Lebanon Middle East
With an estimated 1.5 million Syrian refugees, Lebanon has the highest number of refugees per capita worldwide [Dylan Collins/Al Jazeera] Bekaa Valley, Lebanon - Five times in as many years, the Lebanese army has forced Abu Ahmad and his family to dismantle and move the plywood-and-tarpaulin structure where they have lived in the Bekaa Valley since 2012. "It took me 15 days to build this one," Abu Ahmad told Al Jazeera, sitting on a thin red mat inside the family's most recent hand-built structure. "Imagine - as soon as I finished building the last one, the army came and told me I had 10 minutes to take it down." Their tent and 67 others in the village of Dalhamiyeh are among hundreds of informal clusters of Syrian refugee tents that dot the fertile plain, Lebanon's breadbasket, along the border with Syria . Abu Ahmad's life in Lebanon has been one of near constant worry and instability, including fear of another "security"-based eviction by the Lebanese army; fear he will be unable to scrape together enough money for rent on their small scrap of land; fear of damaging his children's future by sending them to work at local farms rather than to school; and increasingly, fear of when and how he will return home. EXPLAINER: Syria's civil war As a pair of rotating fans beats back the stifling summer heat, Abu Ahmad, a taxi driver from the central Syrian city of Hama, says he is concerned that his family's next move may be a forced march back across the border. "We're scared that at a certain point, they are going to try and force us to return to an area in Syria they consider safe. We don't want to be forcefully returned. We know those areas aren't safe," he said. Abu Ahmad's fear peaked after a series of mass refugee returns organised by Hezbollah , a Lebanese armed group and political party that has long served as a key ground force fighting on behalf of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . In a swift six-day campaign in July, Hezbollah routed fighters belonging to the armed group Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham from a mountainous border area near the town of Arsal, long exposed to spillover violence from the war in Syria. Taking advantage of the area's rugged terrain, hardline fighters had for three years used it to set up bases, and to attack and kidnap members of the Lebanese armed forces. An estimated 50,000 refugees had accumulated in the lawless enclave by the time Hezbollah moved in. As part of a ceasefire deal to end the battle between Hezbollah and Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham, at least 7,500 Syrians - including hardline fighters, their families and refugees living in the area - were bussed out of Lebanon and into Syria's northwestern Idlib province, an area now almost entirely controlled by Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham. The camp in Dalhamiyeh is among hundreds of informal clusters of Syrian refugee tents in the Bekaa Valley [Dylan Collins/Al Jazeera] The evacuation was quickly followed by a separate deal with a different rebel group operating in the area, in which Hezbollah led the transfer of another 3,000 refugees and rebels in the Arsal area across the border to Syria's Qalamoun region. The exodus marked the largest formal repatriation of refugees since the war in Syria began nearly seven years ago. But international relief organisations were not given access to the returnees either prior to, or during, the transfers, and have cautioned that conditions for a safe and voluntary return might not have been met. "We believe many of the refugees that were brought to Idlib are not from there. If they're not returning to their homes, it's not considered a return; it's secondary displacement," said Mike Bruce, an advocacy officer with the Norwegian Refugee Council in Lebanon. Lisa Abu Khalid, a spokeswoman for the United Nations refugee agency in Lebanon, told Al Jazeera that "conditions are not yet conducive for refugee returns to take place in safety and dignity", noting that the UNHCR was "concerned" that they were brought to an area where active fighting is taking place. The operation in Arsal has brought questions to the forefront about the future of the five million Syrians displaced into Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey. In Lebanon, in particular, it comes as anti-refugee rhetoric has reached a pinnacle. Lebanese leaders from across the political spectrum - including President Michel Aoun - have increasingly called for Syrian refugees to return home, voluntarily or not. Municipalities in the Bekaa have called for the shutdown of businesses run by Syrian refugees and the expulsion of refugees from their respective jurisdictions. Tens of thousands of people have signed online petitions calling for refugees to go home. With an estimated 1.5 million Syrian refugees, Lebanon has the highest number of refugees per capita worldwide. The burden is exacerbated by Lebanon's weak political system: Politicians use refugees as deflection points as infrastructure projects stall, daily blackouts roll across the country and a years-long rubbish crisis remains unsolved. The electricity situation is so bad that the energy minister this month inked a deal with Damascus, under which the neighbouring war-torn country will help Lebanon keep its lights on. "This is where the pressure starts," Sima Ghaddar, a Beirut-based policy associate with the Century Foundation, told Al Jazeera. "Negative perceptions become public facts [and] Syrian refugees become the reason behind all of Lebanon's economic, social and political problems." READ MORE: Bringing facts back to Lebanon's refugee conversation While Abu Ahmad said that his personal relations with the local Lebanese community have been cordial, he worries that increasingly strident anti-refugee stands by community and political leaders could increase the domestic appetite for further mass returns. "I'd return today if it was safe. I think any Syrian here would," he said. "You think we like living in tents like this, sending our children out into the fields instead of educating them? "But return to where?" he added. "To Idlib? We know it's not safe there." Syria's neighbouring countries are increasingly pushing for refugees to be returned to "safe zones" proposed as part of a Russian-led "de-escalation plan" for Syria's seven-year war . But active fighting is still present in three of the four zones, including the province of Idlib. Nearly two million people are packed into Idlib province, Syria's last northern rebel redoubt. Idlib has long been the dumping ground for evacuation deals that have emptied besieged rebel-held areas across the country; half the civilians now in Idlib have been internally displaced, and most rely on aid. 'We're scared that at a certain point, they are going to try and force us to return to an area in Syria they consider safe,' says Abu Ahmad [Dylan Collins/Al Jazeera] The future of the province is bleak. Civilians are exposed to bombing by both the Syrian government and the US-led international coalition as they increasingly target hardline fighters, steadily depleting aid and collapsing public services. "To be honest, all I see here are people arriving, not leaving," Abu Ahmad's neighbour, Abu Ziad, told Al Jazeera. "Just last night, some of my relatives arrived from Deir Az Zor." Several tents away, a grandmother, her daughter-in-law and four young children sit in a baking hot tent with no fans. Still reeling from their journey, the grandmother tells of their escape, aided by smugglers, from an area in Syria's western desert controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) group, which is now under attack by Syrian government troops and US-backed forces. The family is broke and exhausted; the children are visibly disturbed. Abu Ahmad notes that a return to government-controlled Syria is out of the question for many men who fear they could be attacked for fleeing the country or forcefully conscripted into the army. The situation in Idlib is looking increasingly grim and Deir Az Zor is out of the question for his family. "Of course, we want to return," Abu Ahmad said, "but only when it's safe."

Israel and Hezbollah fought a bloody 34-day war in 2006 that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,100 Lebanese [File: The Associated Press] Tensions between Israel and its northern neighbours have risen once again, stirring fears of another military confrontation between the Lebanon-based Hezbollah armed group and the Israeli army. While the border region has remained restive since the 2006 war between the two sides and the discussion of another conflict has become almost constant, a series of recent developments have renewed such worries. On Thursday, the Syrian state news agency reported an attack by Israeli jets on a military facility in western Syria , killing two people. Though Israel did not claim responsibility for the attack, a former major general, Yaakov Amidror, told Israel's largest radio station, the Army Radio, that the attack was an effort to weaken Iran and Hezbollah, who operate in Syria. Amos Yadlin, the former head of Israeli military intelligence, also said on Twitter that the attack sent several "important messages", including Israel's refusal to "allow for empowerment and production of strategic arms". READ MORE: Syria's civil war explained from the beginning Earlier this week, Israel also began a 10-day military drill, the largest in two decades, on its border with Lebanon. The Israeli army said the main goal of the exercise was to "improve combat readiness on the northern front" and to "adapt the response to the challenges" facing Israel. The drill comes after accusations by the United Nations envoys for Israel and the United States that the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon was ignoring a buildup of Iranian arms by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, on the Israeli border. Experts and political analysts say that while a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah is unlikely, the option should not be ruled out. "Based on the information that we have, I think it is improbable that a war would break out, even though there have been several limited attacks by both parties. However, Israel could surprise us with war in the moment we least expect it," Kassem Kassir, a Lebanon-based journalist with close ties to Hezbollah, told Al Jazeera. Israel and Hezbollah fought a bloody 34-day war in 2006 that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,100 Lebanese, the majority of whom were civilians; around 4,400 were injured and an estimated one million displaced. An estimated 159 Israelis, including 43 civilians, were also killed by Hezbollah's rocket attacks. The group was able to overwhelm Israel's ground invasion of southern Lebanon and strike military and civilian targets, undermining internal Israeli support for the war and spurring regional support for Hezbollah's military successes against a state army. With Hezbollah's deep involvement in the war in Syria over the past six years, the group and those close to it argue that it has gained a more sophisticated level of tactical experience and weaponry while fighting alongside the Syrian regime and allied groups. Others say the war has worn the group out and prevented it from engaging in a future conflict with Israel.

PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Yet, on several occasions in the past few years, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has threatened that the group would be capable of invading Israel's northern region and beyond in the case of an Israeli offensive against Lebanon. In a speech last year, Nasrallah also mentioned a chemical plant in the city of Haifa where thousands of ammonia tanks are stored as a potential target, threatening death to tens of thousands. "Hezbollah, after it entered the war in Syria, acquired new abilities and powers that it did not enjoy before the war in Syria. Hezbollah went from fighting guerilla warfare to engaging in professional army-scale battles in areas across Syria for the first time," Kassir said. "Also, the coordination that is happening between Hezbollah and Russia - which, for the first time, are sharing the same fighting field - also constitutes worry for Israel. The other point which must be highlighted is that Hezbollah now has a relationship with tens of thousands of non-Lebanese fighters that have participated in the fight in Syria - whether Afghanis, Pakistanis or Iraqis - which could possibly participate in any future confrontation between Hezbollah and Israel." Over the course of the war in Syria, Israel has targeted Syrian and Hezbollah arms convoys on multiple occasions, saying it would continue to block any Iranian efforts to transfer weapons to the group. Hezbollah expert Amal Saad said the changing nature of the war in Syria has meant that Israel would no longer be fighting a "localised war". "There's no longer a separation of battlefronts, and Israel has made sure of that because of its aggression on Syrian territory. It has become a very active player on the Syrian battlefront, and therefore, it has ensured that Hezbollah and the Syrian regime remain linked; it's erased the borders in that sense," Saad told Al Jazeera. And while there have been tit-for-tat attacks - including assassinations, attacks on arms convoys, and rocket attacks on the borders - analysts agree these incidents would not necessarily spark a war. "These are limited attacks or security responses - designed to respond to a single event - which do not warrant a wide-scale conflict. For the two parties to go to war there would need to be aggression of a different level, such as an invasion or large-scale attack," Saad said. "Is Israel ready for another round of war with Hezbollah knowing full well that we're no longer talking about a localised war? We're talking about a regional war that would involve the participation of all the allied groups fighting in Syria." READ MORE: The history of Hezbollah, from Israel to Syria For now, the military drill seems to be a form of psychological warfare intended to make a statement about the Israeli army's capabilities. "The exercise has two main objectives: first, training the Israeli army for a large-scale confrontation in light of Israel's inferior strategic position as a result of the war in Syria, [including] Hezbollah's growing military capacities in Lebanon [and the] expanded presence of Iranian and Iranian-backed armed forces in Syria," said Ofer Zalzberg, a senior Israel/Palestine analyst for the Brussels-based International Crisis Group think-tank. "Second, [it is about] demonstrating to others the sheer strength and scale of Israel's military capacities," Zalzberg told Al Jazeera. Still, indicators point to the growing influence of Iran, Israel's principal enemy in the region, as the reason behind the recent symbolic escalation. Along with Russia , Iran has been able to tip the scales of the conflict in Syria in favour of the Syrian regime. And with the war edging ever closer to Israel's borders, the Israeli fear of an Iranian corridor through Iraq and Syria to Lebanon has come to the forefront. "We do not interfere in the question of who will rule in Damascus; we interfere with the question of how strong Iran and Hezbollah will be in the region," Amidror said in his interview on Israel's Army Radio. In the context of the regional divide between the Gulf states and Iran, Israeli officials and analysts have often spoken of an unofficial "moderate axis" of Arab countries that are working behind the scenes with the Israeli government. In this "alliance", US-backed countries including Egypt , Saudi Arabia and several of the Gulf states, as well as Jordan and Morocco, are said to be pitted against "common enemies" Syria, Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah. Saad believes that Hezbollah's role in the war in Syria has only strengthened the alliance between the latter and added other countries, including Iraq, to what she terms the "resistance axis". "Iran is far more influential than the US and Saudi Arabia in the region. That's very worrisome for Israel and its allies, the tightest of which is Saudi Arabia."

Syrian refugee camps dotted in and around the Lebanese town of Arsal, near the border with Syria, Lebanon [Reuters] In 2009, Muammar Gaddafi made a plea for a new state called Isratine , one state inclusive of both Israel and Palestine. Even though that state remains far away, the Libyan dictator made a good case for it. Today, there may be another kind of merger between Middle Eastern states underway, an undeclared one to be sure, another indicator of the kaleidoscopic disintegration of Sykes Picot and the dissolution of borders. That fusion may be between Lebanon and what is tragically called "useful" Syria, the geography that encompasses Aleppo, Damascus, the Mediterranean coast and Damascus airport.

What makes the blur between these two entities even more real is also the untold numbers of Syrian refugees in Lebanon today. Blending of two nations Their presence ironically achieves what political parties calling for a formal Syrian-Lebanese union could not, the blending of the two nations. These refugees are not going home anytime soon; the reconstruction of cities and towns for them to do so will be neither available nor affordable. The inevitable ethnic cleansing of war also means they may no longer be welcome in the areas where they once came from. OPINION: Lebanese oligarchy preserves its interests once again Of course, officially, there will still be a Lebanon and a Syria. There will be no official integration as Gaddafi called for in Isratine, but there will an unnamed, unofficial controller in this space, and that is Iran now stretching its might from Tehran to the Mediterranean. Whether through clever manipulation, veiled or less-veiled threat, its considerable military might and the more considerable disorganisation of its opponents, the political future of the country has fallen into [Hezbollah's] hands. On the level of political froth, Saad al-Hariri's nomination of Michel Aoun, effectively Hezbollah's candidate, as president of Lebanon puts the stamp on that reality. Why not the Russians? Russia does have power and influence but it does not have the vast and detailed presence, nor wield the numerous militias - a kind of Shia "internationale" - networks of intelligence, land purchases and cultural influence that Tehran does have. In Lebanon today, Hezbollah is calling the shots. Whether through clever manipulation, veiled or less-veiled threat, its considerable military might and the more considerable disorganisation of its opponents, the political future of the country has fallen into its hands. Implicit division Assad's current campaign in Aleppo will permit him to declare a kind of victory and reclaim his status as an unmovable reality. Meanwhile, the reality in Syria is of an implicit division, "useful Syria", Kurdish Syria and the disaggregated remainder. The relationship between these parts is likely to be a disorganised and shifting array of conflict, talks, deals and infrequent humanitarian assistance. Iran stands like a shadow behind both, Hezbollah-controlled Lebanon and the Assad-controlled part of Syria. It is likely to be clever and play this zone with deftness, maintaining the minorities' sense of security, and even Beirut's multicultural and financial glitz and glitter. OPINION: Lebanon and the land of Karagoz There is no reason to become oppressive as long as what matters, security control and the material benefits that come with it, is maintained. However, with all that will also come cultural change. As Lebanese Shias have already taken on greater cultural dimensions of Iran via Hezbollah, so Lebanon will morph. It will slowly become less Levantine, more desert than sea. Some will see in this a return to a natural hinterland, but the political obstacles remain considerable. The large majority of Syrian refugees in Lebanon are Sunnis, ironically displacing the sectarian problems arising out of the war of Syria into Lebanon. Ticking time bomb When combined with the existing Sunni-Shia rift in Lebanon, this can spell trouble over time for the effective Iranian control. This is a ticking time bomb in the north of Lebanon, in Tripoli, Akkar, and possibly in other areas of the country. As Gaddafi argued, the merger of states and populations can, in theory, be salutory, even necessary. However, the intermediate realities may also be quite harsh. If it does not soon let go soon of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Israel will be staring a Palestinian majority in the face over the coming decades. This will be the one state that Gaddafi called for, but with Jewish Israeli rule over an angry population. So also in Lebanon and useful Syria, effective Shia control over Sunnis will remain a difficult and problematic concept. As much as the dissolution of borders may ultimately herald a more organic Middle East, healed from the amputations of its colonial borders, such political entities won't function well as long as any hegemony imposes its will on a recalcitrant population, whether that is Israel over the Palestinians or Iran/Hezbollah and Assad over Sunnis. That's a lesson that still seems far away in almost every single part of the Middle East. John Bell is director of the Middle East programme at the Toledo International Centre for Peace in Madrid.

Syrian refugee children look out from their tent in Saadnayel in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley [Mohamed Azakir/Reuters] As if all it takes is an online petition to the US state department and the United Nations to "rid" Lebanon of its refugee crisis, over 20,000 signatories signed a petition calling for "Syrian refugees to leave Lebanon and return to safe zones in Syria". While the petition is sloppily written, it is an important reflection of what goes on in the hearts and minds of a portion of the Lebanese public, who view the refugee crisis as an economic, security and demographic threat that "might lead to serious altercations between the [Syrian refugees and Lebanese people]". Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5379102814001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5379102814001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: Syrian war refugees: More than 5 million have now fled (1:43) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The petition comes in the context of a rise in anti-refugee discourse in the country, from Syrian businesses being shut down in some municipalities, to a banner threatening to "cut the hands" of Syrians if they threaten Lebanese livelihood, and even a fake news story about 300,000 new refugee births in 2017 that raised the alarm about resulting demographic changes. Such voices are certainly not representative of the Lebanese people as a whole. Many Lebanese activists, lawyers and groups have done their best to help Syrian refugees in their "temporary home" as they await a settlement that would allow them to return home. Yet, an anti-refugee rhetoric plagues the small country of 4.5 million people, already hosting Palestinian refugees , as it struggles to cope with 1.5 million Syrian refugees. Lebanon is the country hosting the most refugees per capita. This fact rightly deserves attention and international support, but it has also been exploited domestically to scapegoat refugees as the main culprits for the dire state of affairs in the country. Scapegoating Refugees Anti-refugee rhetoric can be seen as a symptom of much larger problems Lebanon is currently facing, as its government is unable to hold parliamentary elections on time, reform state institutions, fight corruption and nepotism, and agree on a unified foreign policy as sharp divisions remain surrounding Hezbollah 's involvement in the Syrian war . Consequently, these legitimate frustrations have been projected onto the Syrian refugees who have become a convenient scapegoat for disgruntled citizens and incompetent politicians. This phenomenon is not unique to Lebanon, as we have seen similar discourse in Europe and the United States as a facade for economic grievances, in addition to being an expression of forthright racism and xenophobia. IN PICTURES: Syrian refugees in Lebanon struggling with health needs One might presume that concerned citizens in a parliamentary democracy would, as a matter of priority, be outraged and launch petitions in favour of holding elections on time, rather than call for Syrian refugees to leave Lebanon and go to a yet undefined and hypothetical "safe zone". However, the hysterical and irrational fear of the "stranger" or "foreigner" has sometimes overcome the capacity for empathy and compassion - interestingly among a populace that has experienced first-hand the suffering and displacement caused by a civil war between 1975 and 1990, as well as by Israeli wars in 1982 and 2006. Most recently in July 2006, many Lebanese people fled to, or through, the Lebanon-Syria borders as a result of the Israeli aerial and naval blockade. If Lebanon is genuinely concerned about the economic and security ramifications pertaining to hosting a large number of refugees, it is worth remembering that adopting an active pro-refugee discourse and countering xenophobia in society will, in the words of the New York Declaration, 'reduce the risks of marginalisation and radicalisation'. Surely some voices have tried to counter said discourse with a fact-based approach that seeks to treat refugees as assets rather than a burden, as a professor at the American University of Beirut, Nasser Yassine , tried to do in a series of tweets . Such initiatives are extremely important in the fight for public opinion, since, generally speaking, Lebanese citizens are bombarded with negative examples of refugees' effect on the economy, crime, e ducation , electricity and terrorism. Countering xenophobia is in the state's interest A government policy that takes refugees' dignity and rights into account is pragmatically and strategically in the state's interest, as was noted by human rights lawyer Ghida Frangieh in relation to the government's residency policy of "reducing the numbers". That policy in fact "stripped more than 70 percent of Syrians residing in Lebanon of their legal residence papers … [and they] became invisible to the Lebanese authorities and lost many of their rights". Taking active steps to ameliorate refugees' living conditions, as well as promoting a non-xenophobic public discourse, will display Lebanon's commitment to international processes and convince donors that the government understands the refugee crisis - not just in terms of amount of funds needed, but also in relation to the treatment of refugees in political and media discourse. As agreed upon in the UN New York Declaration on Migrants and Refugees ( pdf ), "combating xenophobia, racism and discrimination in our societies against refugees and migrants" should be among the top priorities of the government as it tries to enact a refugee policy (obviously, countering xenophobia should also be coupled with the declaration's injunction for refugees "to observe the laws and regulations of their host countries"). READ MORE: Should Lebanon get more funds for hosting refugees? Thereby, Lebanon can seek to have a stronger voice in ongoing global negotiations on the refugee crisis from the standpoint of a state that is doing the right thing at home. Speaking with me in her personal capacity, Alia Aoun, senior legal adviser on Humanitarian Affairs to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said "it is counterproductive to work on the assumption that making life harder for refugees will cause them to return to Syria. The result would be undocumented refugees which is not in the refugees' or Lebanon's interest".

For this reason, politicians and media outlets that have contributed to xenophobic public discourse should actively seek to right the wrong that has been done, and is still being done, by acknowledging that fear-triggered xenophobia is the wrong approach. Absent an all-inclusive refugee policy, Syrian refugees living in extremely difficult conditions, where even " death brings a final indignity ", will be driven into the hands of criminal networks who exploit people in search of better prospects, or simply for an honest day's work. If Lebanon is genuinely concerned about the economic and security ramifications pertaining to hosting a large number of refugees, it is worth remembering that adopting an active pro-refugee discourse and countering xenophobia in society will, in the words of the New York Declaration, "reduce the risks of marginalisation and radicalisation". In short, xenophobic discourse leads to an environment of marginalisation, social exclusion and dehumanisation, all in the name of protecting the economy, nationalism and security. It is never too late to start over and put forward a calm, rational, fact-based approach to the refugee crisis that would allow the country to make the best out of a very difficult situation in the interest of both the Lebanese state and refugees.

Lebanon Syrian Refugees Racism Politics Middle East
A Syrian refugee child holds a bread at a camp for Syrian refugees near the town of Qab Elias, in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, August 8, 2017 [Jamal Saidi/Reuters] President Michel Aoun told the United Nations General Assembly last month that Lebanon should be the permanent centre of an institution dedicated to peace education with a "focus on forgiveness and coexistence". Less than three weeks later, his son-in-law and Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil tweeted : "We are racist in our Lebanese identity" in reference to his refusal to naturalise Syrian refugees . This was a reminder of how it has become socially acceptable to be racist in Lebanon, as well as elsewhere, as the rapid rise of xenophobia continues. As sociologist Rima Majed from the American University of Beirut noted: "In times of crises, 'political correctness' fades away and the real dynamics of power and social hierarchies appear more clearly, often taking the ugly shape of racism." {articleGUID} Bassil urged people not to call him and his party racist; he claimed that he represents the antithesis of the racism of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) and of Israel. It did not occur to him that the best way to avoid being called racist is not to declare it publicly on Twitter . How else did he expect non-racist Lebanese citizens to react to a tweet from their foreign minister including them in the "we", and associating them with "racism" as a mark of their Lebanese identity. 'Honourable patriot' or 'useful idiot'? This juxtaposition of patriotism and the need to take an anti-refugee stance was also evoked in July, prior to the military operation to liberate Arsal. When activists tried to stage a demonstration in support of refugees and calling for accountability for alleged deaths under torture of at least five Syrians, there was a fierce backlash. The choice was, as an editorial by the NGO Legal Agenda put it, being labelled an "honourable patriot" or a "traitor" - or, in the best case scenario, a trivial individual idealising human rights and supporting refugees who have only brought terrorism and economic and political hardships to the country. It is enough to look at the mistreatment of domestic workers, especially from Asia and Africa, to understand that Lebanon has a racism problem that goes beyond the discrimination of refugees. In other words, the choice presented to the Lebanese people by Bassil and like-minded politicians is to be an anti-refugee honourable patriot or a refugee-loving useful idiot (or traitor). This choice is not limited to those defending Syrian refugees. It also applies to activists for the cause of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. Calls for improving their inhumane living conditions and putting an end to the policy of social exclusion have been ignored and viewed with suspicion. State policies of isolating the community have contributed to discrimination, dire living conditions, poverty, lack of economic opportunities and bleak future prospects for Palestinians living in refugee camps. Racism and racial discrimination Now, to avoid a futile debate on semantics, I am using the word "racism" as interchangeable with "racial discrimination", as set forth by the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination that includes "national origin" as a basis for "any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference". The Durban Declaration ( pdf ) also recognises that "xenophobia against non-nationals, particularly migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers, constitutes one of the main sources of contemporary racism and that human rights violations against members of such groups occur widely in the context of discriminatory, xenophobic and racist practices". {articleGUID} Undeniably, discrimination or targeted campaigns against Syrians based on "national origin" have been widespread and well documented. The prevalent discourse on the refugee crisis has been dehumanising and vilifying, describing refugees as a burden, ungrateful or unwanted guests, and even murderers and rapists (especially after the horrifying murder of a Lebanese woman by her family's Syrian caretaker in a Christian village in the North of Lebanon in September). As a result, all Syrians were asked to leave the village, and other municipalities followed suit in order to "act before it is too late" and to protect "our women" and "our country". A local resident told the Washington Post in words that evoke the bad memories of Lebanon's civil war: "If they didn't leave we would have killed them. The whole town is against them. All Lebanon is against them." Little did it matter that many Lebanese women suffer crimes at the hands of Lebanese men and that scapegoating "Syrian refugees" overlooks the real solution to violence against women and girls that involves reforming discriminatory laws and combatting sexism and patriarchy in all its forms. Racism before and beyond the refugee crisis In Lebanon and Europe , the association of racism with anti-refugee and anti-migrant discourse has dominated the discussion recently, with the rise of far-right nationalism as the most obvious threat to democracy. But is it fair to speak about Lebanon's "racism problem" given the scale of the refugee crisis and the bloody history of the country that have left citizens genuinely worried for their stability and security? Let us put aside the discussion of political, religious, demographic and geopolitical considerations - including legitimate frustrations and concerns of Lebanese citizens - that are used as justifications for the current discourse and simply ask whether racism exists independently of the Syrian and Palestinian refugee crises. {articleGUID} It is enough to look at the mistreatment of domestic workers, especially from Asia and Africa to understand that Lebanon has a racism problem that goes beyond the discrimination of refugees. According to a survey conducted by Lebanese anti-violence NGO KAFA and the American University of Beirut in collaboration with Anti-Slavery International, part of the Lebanese society holds some twisted perceptions of domestic workers: 27 percent consider them "unclean" although they clean and cook for them; 36 percent consider them stupid although they are in charge of all domestic affairs; and 51 percent consider them untrustworthy although they take care of their children and ageing parents. KAFA conducted a social experiment in supermarkets selling a "special soap" for domestic workers. While some Lebanese shoppers criticised this deliberately racist product, others were more than happy to give the soap - that would "clean" their "unclean" domestic workers - a try. Another report by KAFA ( pdf ) found that "over 88 percent of employers withhold the passport of the domestic worker to prevent her from escaping and 80 percent do not allow her to leave the employer's house on her day off." The report also revealed that 31.3 percent of Lebanese employers lock the domestic workers they hire inside the house when they leave. If this isn't racism (and modern-day slavery), what is? First things first An insightful response reminding Bassil of the danger of racism towards Lebanese and non-Lebanese alike came from photographer Dalia Khamissy who tweeted back at the foreign minister the names and pictures of mothers still waiting for the fate of their missing sons and husbands. They are men who died or disappeared in the civil war , Khamissy said , "precisely because of our racism [towards each other]". At the end of the day, Bassil's tweet can be a blessing in disguise. As Lebanese citizens, it can force us to rethink our attitudes and practices, not as a form of self-flagellation or self-hate, but in order to ask uncomfortable and difficult questions about the type of society we would like to live in, and for what causes we stand up for when it matters the most. Lebanon has a racism problem. Let us deal with that first, and only then can we sincerely offer our services to become a global centre for peace education promoting forgiveness and coexistence.

Egypt recently blocked more than 400 websites on claims of 'supporting terrorism' and 'publishing false information' [File: AFP] Support for freedom of speech in Egypt has fallen significantly since 2013, according to a new survey, the largest of its kind in the Arab world. The annual survey , titled Media Use in the Middle East and conducted by Northwestern University in Qatar, spans seven Arab countries. It tracked regional media trends and attitudes towards free speech over the past five years. More than 1,000 people were surveyed in each of Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan , Qatar, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in face-to-face interviews and by phone. The survey also incorporated the United States , where more than 2,000 respondents were interviewed. "It's quite a representative survey. It's very scientifically derived," Everette Dennis, the dean of Northwestern University in Qatar , told Al Jazeera, adding that the sample size "is well ahead of what most studies would ever do". KEY FINDINGS Among the seven surveyed countries, Lebanon ranked highest in its belief in the right to criticise government policy Compared with five years ago, internet penetration rose most dramatically in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia More Americans than Arab nationals say people should be able to criticise the government online, but fewer Americans say it is safe to express political opinions online Saudis, more than other Arab nationals, are likelier to perceive greater political influence online, while Emiratis are the least likely "There were 120 questions. We wanted to distinguish by gender, income, nationality, citizenship, and I think the findings are representative and are as good as you get." The study found that while in 2013, roughly half (48 percent) of Egyptians said "it is okay for individuals to express their ideas on the internet even if they are unpopular", only 29 percent agreed in 2017. According to experts, the figures are very telling of the regional changes following the Arab uprisings of 2011, when masses took to the streets to demand the downfall of dictators. The uprisings, which started in Tunisia , spread to five other countries - Egypt, Syria , Yemen , Libya and Bahrain - with a variety of outcomes. After ending 30 years of dictatorship under Hosni Mubarak in the 2011 revolution, Egypt saw the return of army rule in a military coup. Under current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi , a long-time military officer and former head of military intelligence, Egypt has taken an authoritarian turn and introduced repressive laws that limit free speech. Most recently, Egypt blocked more than 400 websites on claims of "supporting terrorism" and "publishing false information". Commenting on the findings with regards to expressing unpopular views on the internet, Sahar Khamis, an expert in Arab media , told Al Jazeera: "This figure speaks for itself ... There is overall an atmosphere of less freedom of expression, less freedom of the press, less freedom of opinion in the country. It's not a secret. "A lot of people who were 'activists' in the pre-2013 period, the young revolutionaries, all of these people either lost hope, and became in a state of despair ... or some of them simply left politics altogether," Khamis added. "If these are the people who were at the front lines, what about the layperson, the average person? Obviously, there is a big regression in the amount of freedom and the amount of comfort that people feel to express their views, whether online or offline." Tunisia The figures on post-revolution Tunisia, on the other hand, seem to reflect positive changes in the country since the removal of former leader Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . Though far from perfect, Tunisia's new constitution, signed after the uprising, was hailed as the most progressive in the region, providing more freedom to criticise state institutions. For the statement "on the internet, it is safe to say whatever one thinks about politics", 44 percent of Tunisians agreed - the third-highest rate among the seven countries surveyed, after Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. Khamis said that Tunisia, which was able to create coalitions and witness a bloodless power transfer after its revolution, was - in contrast to the rest of the Arab countries that experienced uprisings - in a state of "nation-building and freedom building". She attributed Tunisia's successful model to the country's high literacy rate. "They are creating a vibrant civil society model that allows for different opinions to be expressed and allows for diversity and plurality ... This will inevitably lead to the Tunisian citizen feeling more comfortable to express their views". Lebanon Standing out from the crowd in terms of support for freedom of expression is Lebanon , according to the survey. The report found that seven in 10 Lebanese and Americans supported criticism of the government on the internet. Figures show that Lebanon aligns more with the United States in supporting criticism of government policies [Courtesy of Northwestern University in Qatar] In contrast with the rest of the Arab countries, tolerance for speech critical of government policies offline was also high in Lebanon, at 66 percent, and Tunisia, at 48 percent. In Qatar and the UAE, the figure stands at 21 and 14 percent, respectively. Beirut-based media commentator Halim Shebaya said that while Lebanon is more relaxed in terms of expressing views, "there is a fundamental difference in how citizens understand their right to freedom of expression and also how the legal system protects that right" in Arab and Western countries. In comparison with Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, the UAE and Qatar, Lebanon has the second-lowest rate of tolerance for speech that is offensive to one's religion or beliefs, according to the survey. "Events have shown that many in Lebanon - and definitely other Arab countries - do not yet grasp the notion that freedom of expression includes the right to express views that may be shocking or offensive to others, especially on religious issues," Shebaya told Al Jazeera.

Akar castle, a 19th-century Beirut palace, was demolished by developers in 2011 [Courtesy of Save Beirut Heritage] Lebanon's heritage has received a significant boost as the government approved a new protection law this week. The draft law was handed over to parliament on Thursday, and heritage activists say they will now focus on lobbying MPs to ensure the proposed protections are put in place. "The law protecting archaeological and heritage buildings … is a historic step," Culture Minister Ghattas Khoury said. "From now on, no heritage buildings will be removed to be replaced by skyscrapers." For years, Lebanese heritage activists have called for laws protecting buildings and sites of historical and cultural significance. Beirut, in particular, has witnessed rampant overdevelopment, as elegant Ottoman and French Mandate-era villas - along with more ancient structures, including a Roman hippodrome - have been replaced by clashing modern developments. Soon after the conclusion of Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war, a government survey counted approximately 2,000 buildings of cultural and historical significance in Beirut. The most recent study in 1997, conducted by the Directorate-General of Urban Planning, recorded just 572, with scores more estimated to have been razed since then. "The heritage situation has become indecent," architect Antoine Atallah, the vice president of Save Beirut Heritage, a pro-preservation NGO, told Al Jazeera. "It has really become a hot topic." Landowners wishing to construct developments on plots with heritage sites often lack the resources to preserve the historic structures as they build new ones; often, it is easier to knock everything down and build from scratch. Under the draft law, a mechanism allows landowners to sell development rights to larger companies who have the resources to build developments while preserving sites of cultural significance. The landowner would still maintain rights to the land. The road ahead Before the new law is voted on, MPs will have a chance to inspect the draft and alter wording. "We will need to ... monitor how the text of the law will evolve to ensure no loopholes will be introduced into the text," Atallah said, noting he remained optimistic about the prospects. But preservation activist Mona el-Hallak sees a tough road ahead, "The law directly reflects on real estate, which is linked to development, which is linked to money, which is linked to corruption," she told Al Jazeera. In 2007, a similar bill was approved by cabinet, only to disappear and never be discussed in parliamentary sessions, el-Hallak said. Despite this, she cited a recent increase in support for heritage preservation. "There is a general feeling among the youth that we are turning into a country without memory," she said. "It's going to be hard, but we will try." SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Lebanon Middle East

A military spokesman said the Israeli planes were on a routine reconnaissance mission over the Lebanon-Syria border area on Monday when they came under fire from the Syrian side of the border. They were not hit. He called it the first incident of Syrian forces targeting Israeli planes since the civil war began in 2011. In response, he said Israel hit a Syrian anti-aircraft battery about 50km east of Damascus and "incapacitated" it. He said Russian forces were notified in real time and that Israel holds Syria responsible for any attack from its territory. There was no immediate response from the Syrian government.

"Today's rewards are another step to increase the pressure on them and their organisation," said Sales.

In his announcement, Hariri cited concerns for his life and blamed Iran and its close Lebanese ally Hezbollah for meddling in Arab affairs.

The younger Hariri's November 2017 resignation, which came after just 11 months in power, ended his second stint as prime minister, a role set aside exclusively for members of Lebanon's Sunni community. He assumed office in December 2016 as prime minister in a power-sharing government headed by President Michel Aoun, a supporter of Hezbollah , whose members have been charged by the International Court of Justice with assassinating Rafik Hariri. After his father's death, Hariri went on to the Future bloc (al-Mustaqbal), which draws its support mainly from the country's Sunni population, and which later formed alliances with other parties from across Lebanon's communal divide.

A Rohingya child's depictions of the violence he said soldiers in Myanmar carried out in his village [Annette Ekin/Al Jazeera] Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh - Inside a colourful bamboo structure in Balukhali camp, groups of children sit on the floor, engrossed in board games, plastic animals and other activities. Two scamper about in costumes - one dressed as Nemo, the other as a lion. Tacked on the walls are vivid crayon drawings - the only explicit reminders of the violence these Rohingya children have witnessed. One 11-year-old boy drew a number of them. "In my village, they did this," he said, referring to his sketches of soldiers killing people and of families in burning houses. One drawing, he explained, shows a playground where the army came and "killed the children", in another, with purple and black helicopters, he pointed at a figure of a soldier who killed a child by "stepping on his chest". "We were tortured by the Myanmar army. When I draw these pictures I feel good [afterwards]," he said, explaining that drawing helps him express what he experienced. This safe space for children, run by the local NGO Community Development Centre (CODEC) in partnership with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), as well as other similar spaces and schools in the refugee camps, allow Rohingya children to interact with each other. According to UNICEF, about 60 percent of the new refugee arrivals are children. Initially, when teachers and outreach workers went door to door to tell parents about these spaces, many of the adults asked whether their children would be safe, explained Lutfur Rahman of CODEC. When the children first came, "they didn't want to talk to each other, and they were also confused about whether this place would be safe or not". They were "uneasy" when given paper and drawing materials, he said. More than half a million Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh since the Myanmar army began a campaign against them that the United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing. Rohingya children's drawings inside a child-friendly space co-run by CODEC and UNICEF in Balukhali refugee camp [Annette Ekin/Al Jazeera] 'Distressed population' In the squalid, overcrowded camps, where refugees struggle to access food and water, and people continue to arrive, many mental health workers say they're in the initial stages of providing protection and psychological first aid (PFA). This entails offering basic support and comfort through, for example, listening to what someone has to say or gestures such as giving someone a glass of water. In the first few weeks after big traumas, PFA is "our main approach," explained Cynthia Scott, a clinical psychologist and mental health activities manager at Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials, MSF. "It's not the time for counselling or in-depth discussion about feelings, it's more about comfort, stabilising someone, so they come back to their normal thinking and functioning." People feel "like they're going crazy", she said, and a big part of her job right now "is just to say, 'No. You're not going crazy'." Mental health workers say refugees are suffering from flashbacks of violent, traumatic events, anxiety, agitation, acute stress, recurring nightmares, not being able to sleep, eat or even speak, and in more severe cases, being unable to look after themselves or their families. "We are facing an overall distressed population," said Mahmuda, who goes by one name, a psychologist and mental health programme associate at UNHCR in Bangladesh. Mahmuda visits groups of refugees to provide PFA, trauma counselling, and to help people manage stress so they can better cope with their current situation. She disseminates basic messages, she says, to help people acknowledge that they are alive and to understand that they are "safe and secure … and not alone". Mahmuda says she is closely observing groups who may develop post-traumatic stress disorder in the coming months. Among those she is working with are survivors of a refugee boat that capsized on September 28, including one woman who lost her child who she was breastfeeding. The pain she feels in her breasts compounds the trauma of her loss, Mahmuda explained. But as refugees move around in search of aid and shelter, following up with them can be difficult, Mahmuda said. At a mobile clinic in Kutupalong makeshift camp, Rohingya refugees receive medical and psychological care [Annette Ekin/Al Jazeera] Outreach work The stories of pain are widespread. One clinical psychologist with Action Against Hunger said one of the worst cases she has seen is that of a woman who fled her village without her child when it came under fire. She now suffers from intense feelings of guilt, exacerbated by seeing other mothers with their children. In Kutupalong makeshift camp, Bangladeshi medical charity Gonoshasthaya Kendra, in partnership with Doctors of the World, runs a mobile clinic out of a tent. Liza Akter, an assistant clinical psychologist at the health post, said if she's on her own she can see about 30 patients a day. One female patient who was shot in the shoulder can no longer look east - where Myanmar is. "Burma is trauma," Akter explained, using the name by which the country was formerly known. Earlier that morning, Akter saw a woman who lives in the camp with her daughter. Her husband and son were killed, and her other daughter was raped then killed. The woman was suffering from anxiety, heart palpitations and was "crying, crying, crying". Akter said she could do little but listen to her. "Their condition is difficult. It's so miserable," she said. On Saturday, September 30, Omar Faruk, an assistant clinical psychologist stationed at the post, went to conduct a group counselling session with another colleague. He recalled how, on a previous occasion when he was conducting outreach work, a small girl had started to cry when he entered the tent. When he asked the girl's mother why her daughter was scared, the woman told him that it was because of his pants. Rohingya men usually wear a lungi, a kind of sarong with a knot at the top where valuables are stored. "These pants reminded her of the pants the military wears," he said. Faruk explained that they prefer working with larger groups as refugees are more comfortable speaking this way. Walking through the camp, Faruk made a right turn onto a narrow dirt path. His colleague approached some women - the men had gone out, some to collect aid - and almost immediately, some 14 refugees appeared with their children and babies and headed into a large tent. Inside, Faruk began by asking the women how they were, then, going around the circle, he asked them where they came from, what happened in their village and how it felt to leave everything behind. "It feels like they're not burning our houses, it feels like they're burning us," said Mariam, 23. Although no one in her immediate family died, she said some of her cousins were killed. When she goes to sleep, she said she imagines soldiers "killing all my family members, my parents and they're killing Muslim people". "They would kill us [if we returned]," she said. "[It was] painful to see our homes burning," said 22-year-old Apsara Begum, who says her husband was beaten to death by Rakhine Buddhists about three years ago while she was pregnant with their son. Omar Faruk, an assistant clinical psychologist with medical charity Gonoshasthaya Kendra working in partnership with Doctors of the World, conducts a group counselling session [Annette Ekin/Al Jazeera] 'Chronic stress' in camps Scott says MSF's mental health programme is now scaling up - adding 10 more counsellors to the seven they already have and setting up more medical posts. In her experience, she says, Rohingya do not seek help citing mental health problems, but their "emotions or stress … present as a physical problem" like headaches or backaches. At the beginning of the crisis, Scott says they "received probably the most vulnerable". "Most people, even if they've suffered these huge traumas, witnessing horrific things, they had to keep going just to get basic shelter, food and water and so the people presenting to us were the ones that could not manage that," she said, adding that most people are able to recover from the trauma. For the most part, people are "having a normal response to an abnormal situation". The concern is where acute trauma begins to affect people's ability to function. She anticipates that in the next few months, as people start to settle into the camps, there'll be "more of the mental conditions that are lasting". And while these refugees have escaped the violence in Myanmar, she said the dire conditions in the camps - the World Health Organization has begun distributing cholera vaccines fearing an outbreak - give rise to a different kind of "chronic stress". Over time, tensions and frustrations in the camps will grow, she believes. "If people start suffering from chronic stress, then tempers start flaring quickly, people get angry quickly, there's more family violence, women are getting beaten more ... there's more sexual violence," she said. She says she has probably seen the worst cases as they are the ones that make it to the hospital - people who are "just kind of lost in their own mind" and "not able to think, not able to know what to do to keep their families safe or to find food". For her, some of the most heartbreaking have involved teenage girls with intellectual disabilities who were raped repeatedly. They've found the families of some, she says, but there's an absence of shelters for people with disabilities where they'll be protected from being abused again. For now, she's had to keep some of these girls at the MSF hospital. "You cannot just put someone like that in a shelter, alone," she said. For sound mental health, basic needs must be fulfilled, and then, normal everyday routines must be established, she said, stressing the need for special supported shelters and schools that will help children adjust. The 'resilience' of children According to Scott, children are resilient but also vulnerable without proper support. "They've witnessed a lot of horrible things. They've seen people killed, they've seen their mothers raped, they have missing relatives. We had children shot in the back while running away." Back at the children's space, as the playing winds down, Wayne Bleier, a child protection and psycho-social specialist at UNICEF, points out that the children are in a space where they can be just that. "I'm always heartened by the resilience I see in children and their ability to cope and to heal themselves," he said. With support, connection to a community, specialised programmes and security restored, most will be okay, he says. A stable family situation can also be crucial. For now, the host community has been welcoming, he adds. "That goes a long way for healing. They feel safe here." But he points to the uncertainty of the future. "What worries me here is refugees are in limbo, and they're not getting a clear message now as to what the future holds - and that wears on people."

More than half a million Rohingya have fled Myanmar to neighbouring Bangladesh [Showkat Shafi/Al Jazeera] Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh - Rohingya trapped inside Myanmar say thousands are starving and in need of medical care in northern Rakhine State, where a half-million majority Muslim ethnic Rohingya have fled an army crackdown and communal violence. Abdulla Mehman, who works for an aid agency in the Buthitaung Township, said more than 2,000 people in his village, Kwan Dine, had run out of food, with many others facing shortages. "We are not allowed to move about freely, and people are struggling to survive," Mehman told Al Jazeera by telephone on Tuesday. "Some people are starving." Rohingya families in at least four other villages in northern Rakhine - Kin Taung, Bura Shida Para, Kyar Gaung Taung, and Sein Daung - also reported urgent food shortages and accused soldiers and Buddhist neighbours of intimidation, looting, extortion and cattle theft. The reports are difficult to verify independently, as the region has been under an army lockdown, but the witness accounts are in line with what Rohingya refugees in neighbouring Bangladesh have been telling Al Jazeera. About a half-million Rohingya are thought to remain in Myanmar's westernmost state. Home were set on fire in Gawdu Zara village, northern Rakhine state, Myanmar, on September 7 [AP] "Please help us," a Rohingya woman from the village of Kin Taung, speaking on the condition of anonymity, begged in a telephone conversation this week. "We are sick, but we cannot seek medical treatment. We cannot work and we cannot eat." A group of 20 diplomats who visited northern Rakhine on an official tour on Monday described the humanitarian situation there as "dire", and urged Aung San Suu Kyi 's government to resume "life-saving services without discrimination". People could die in Rakhine State if aid does not arrive soon, Human Rights Watch said. The Myanmar government could not be reached for comment. It has previously promised to deliver aid to communities affected by the violence. Accounts by refugees pouring into Bangladesh of mass killings, gang-rapes, and burning of whole villages has led the UN to accuse the Myanmar government of ethnic cleansing, a claim it denies. The woman in Kin Taung told Al Jazeera that soldiers had threatened to rape the civilians and burn down homes of Rohingya, and were extorting money, food and cattle from them. Her family had to bribe soldiers to keep their homes safe, she said. Her husband, a 30-year-old farmer, said: "If any Rohingya are seen on the streets after the Maghrib prayer (dusk), then we are fined 200,000 Burmese kyat ($147). If they find cattle, they take that also." 'People will die' Nay San Lwin, a Rohingya activist based in Germany , said northern Rakhine was "like a prison" and that thousands of Rohingya were continuing to flee their homes after the army intensified a campaign of intimidation and arson this week. Paul Seger, Switzerland's ambassador to Myanmar, who joined the government tour of Rakhine, posted a video on Twitter of smoke rising from some villages on Monday.

The office of the army chief Min Aung Hlaing, in a Facebook post on Thursday, blamed the fresh bout of arson on the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Front (ARSA). The refugee crisis erupted after ARSA fighters attacked border posts on August 25. In some areas, the violence has ebbed, but Rohingya said they lived in fear. "The situation is calm now, but we cannot go to the shops to buy necessities because we are afraid the Buddhists may beat us," Abu Tayeb, a teacher in Bura Shida Para in north Maungdaw, said by telephone. "We cannot get adequate food and we cannot pray [at the mosques]." Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch told Al Jazeera that he was "concerned" by the lack of information about the hundreds of thousands remaining in Rakhine. He added: "It is imperative that the Myanmar authorities give full humanitarian access to northern Rakhine or people will die." Mehman, the aid worker from Kwan Dine, said he will not flee even when his food reserves run out next week. "Bangladesh is not my country," he said. "The government wants to push us out. I don't want to leave, even if I have to eat leaves." Additional reporting by Anamur Rahman ABOUT THE AUTHORS Zaheena Rasheed Zaheena is an Al Jazeera journalist based in Doha.

RenderPagesVideo('5622220102001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh - A recently arrived Rohingya couple stood sobbing in the sudden afternoon downpour outside a booth on the main drag of the Kutupalong registered refugee camp. It was Wednesday, September 27, and that morning, their four-year-old son had disappeared while his mother was washing herself. The child, who someone had dropped off at this lost and found booth for missing children, sat crying in the covered stall. Kamal Hossain, who runs the booth that helps reunite Rohingya children with their families, didn't immediately hand the child over to the couple. He had first to ensure that they were his parents. So Kamal gently coaxed the boy to point out his mother in the crowd of onlookers. "Tell me who is your mother? Is that your mother?" he asked, pointing at different women. After an agonising wait for the couple, Kamal was satisfied that the boy had identified his mother with a nod of his head. The woman reached out to hold her son, crying with relief. "Here you will find so many people and [you] cannot be sure who is good or bad," Kamal later explained. Part of his work involves cross-checking that children are being reunited with their families and not with "someone else who can sell them or abuse them". On September 27, this couple was reunited with their son in Kutupalong registered refugee camp at a booth that helps locate missing family members [Annette Ekin/Al Jazeera] In this thoroughfare, a dirt road congested with refugees on the move, edged with clinics and schools and a registration centre, Kamal and his simple microphone booth have become a constant presence - and a source of hope for people looking for lost family members in the ever-changing throng. The most recent round of brutal repression by the Myanmar army - described as ethnic cleansing by the UN - has forced more than half a million ethnic Rohingya to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh . Soon after the refugees began to arrive in the border area , Kamal found a woman crying outside his office gate in Kutupalong. Kamal, who works as a security guard for the international aid organisation, Handicap International, learned that the woman's child had gone missing. Kamal, himself a Rohingya refugee from Boli Bazar in Myanmar, whose family fled army violence and came to Bangladesh in the 1990s, pondered how he could help. "I thought for the entire day, what to do, how can I find the child," recalled the wiry, soft-spoken man with a gentle smile. It had to be something that could penetrate the crowds, he concluded. Kamal decided to hire a microphone for eight days, paying 3,000 Bangladeshi Taka (about $36) - his monthly salary - figuring that if he announced missing children's names "people can hear me and they can pass it from person to person". Kamal helped to track down the woman's child. "So I continued it," he said. "I feel so good when one person is finding another person through [this]." The UNHCR now supports the initiative, and Kamal works at the booth full-time. READ MORE: Who are the Rohingya? He makes announcements about individuals whose families have reported them missing or about unaccompanied minors who have been brought to his booth. "I announce five things: name of the village [in Myanmar], name of the child, name of mother, name of father and age of the child," said Kamal, adding that he usually includes a description of the child's clothing. He meticulously records everything in a workbook. Kamal starts work at around 8:30am and finishes late at night. He says he makes around 40 to 50 announcements a day. He can usually be spotted inside the booth with other volunteers. Outlets for refugees to charge their mobile phones for free (charging stations usually have a fee of about 10 Bangladeshi Taka, around $0.12) were recently installed on the large wooden table the microphone sits on. On Saturday, Kamal said that more than 1,200 people - mostly mothers - had registered missing family members, while he estimates that about 700 families have been reunited. According to Kamal, many reunited families don't report back, but those whose family members are still missing tend to return time and again to the booth asking for news. Kamal, who has three children, the oldest a 12-year-old son, has sheltered three Rohingya girls, aged around 16, 12 and seven, in his family's home in the camp. People found the two younger girls by the road and the other in a market and brought them to the booth. "They're not safe here as they are girls and there are so many men - anything can happen to them, that's why I took them along with me," he said. READ MORE - 'I watched my son drown': Rohingya boat survivor He would announce their names in his daily broadcasts; two have since been reunited with their families, one through the announcements. In this refugee crisis, where more than half a million Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh since August 25 and more continue to come, Kamal says the wealthy are able to help with money and aid. "I'm poor. I don't have this chance. I can do only this thing," he said, referring to the announcements. Still, Kamal has made a intangible difference to many people's lives by reuniting families. As a refugee who has lived in Bangladesh for years, we wanted his unique, personal perspective on what his fellow Rohingya are enduring. Al Jazeera provided Kamal with an instant camera and asked him to photograph what he believes people need to see. This is what he came back with: Two days after he started the microphone announcements, Kamal said his friend found the girl pictured above and brought her to his booth. The child, who is about seven years old, had become separated from her family two days after they arrived in Bangladesh. Kamal sheltered her in his family home. He put her picture up on his Facebook page along with his mobile number and said the girl's uncle, who lives in Malaysia, found the post and contacted her father. On Saturday, the girl's father came to collect her. When they were reunited "they started crying," he said. Kamal said he photographed them near the booth. For Kamal, this is the most important picture that he took. It depicts, he said, the reality of what is happening in Myanmar and the nature of the violence being inflicted upon the Rohingya. "[The] Myanmar army killed her husband and another child in front of her. They were four in the family. Her husband and son were killed," Kamal said, adding that the girl was stabbed and the woman was raped. "While leaving, they burned the house down with mother and daughter inside," he said. The woman was severely burned. "If people see this picture, they will know the real scenario here, and they will come and work for them. [They'll see] that they need support," Kamal reflected. The mother and child in the picture are now staying with a family in the Kutupalong registered refugee camp. This is Rohima, who Kamal said is about 16 years old and comes from a village in Maungdaw township in Myanmar. "She was with her family. She was crossing the border and then she lost her parents and as she doesn't know anything about Bangladesh - where to go, what to do - she followed some refugees and just came here," he said. Rohima turned up at his booth and asked him to make an announcement for her. "I don't have any power to mic anywhere else. I can only mic here," he said. "It's almost around 20 days that this girl is at my house and I haven't found her parents." Kamal said he announces her case every hour and wishes he could spread the news that she is looking for her parents so that she might find them. He said she has become like a daughter and has bonded with his wife, but said it would be difficult to accommodate her indefinitely. The man in the photograph was injured in a road accident while he was collecting aid soon after he arrived in Bangladesh, Kamal said. Kamal is critical of those distributing aid by the side of the road. "There are so many people from Myanmar, they came here, and they don't know anything about the country. They came here, and they encountered with accidents, so I captured this picture so that people give aid somewhere else - not just right beside the road - to our people," he said. The man sustained a head injury from the accident and "is roaming around". Kamal said he found him in Balukhali camp and on Saturday he was in front of his booth. "He can speak. If he says 10 sentences, maybe two are correct," he said. This picture is important, he believes, "because the people [who] are providing aid beside the road, they need to know this, they need to go to some safer place to provide aid because people are in need of it and they will definitely go there."

Bangladeshi villagers pray by the bodies of Rohingya Muslim children who drowned while crossing over from Myanmar into Bangladesh [Dar Yasin/AP Photo] Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh - Eighteen-year-old Rohingya refugee Amir Mia is carrying his deceased grandfather's body through the Balukhali expansion camp in the Bangladeshi port city of Cox's Bazar. He is taking his grandfather to be buried in a graveyard that was created after the recent influx of Rohingya refugees, fleeing violence by the Myanmar army that the UN has described as ethnic cleansing, began on August 25. He was elderly and died of age-related diseases, he explains as he winds his way through the camp's narrow, muddy lanes. As various waves of Rohingya refugees have fled Myanmar over the past few decades, filling the camps, which have in turn expanded, camp residents have buried their dead wherever they could find the space. Without any land being set aside for graveyards by the Bangladeshi government, the refugees have identified their own sites. The small graveyard in which Amir is burying his grandfather already looks overcrowded. The graves are packed closely together, temporary bamboo fences separating one from another. In the neighbouring Kutupalong registered camp, 16-year-old Mohammad Alam, who was born in Bangladesh after his parents fled Myanmar in the 1990s, explains that his father is the leader of one block of the camp and a gravedigger who is responsible for digging graves for the residents of his block. The graveyards have become overcrowded, Mohammad explains, with three or four bodies being placed in each grave after the recent influx of refugees. "Unlike life, death is an inevitable truth and here no one can be buried peacefully as we must dig old graves to make new ones," Mohammad elaborates as he stands at a tea stall beside one of the new graveyards in the Kutupalong expansion camp. He has seen people burying their dead in front of their houses, he adds. "New refugees don't know about this place. They don't know where to go or what to do. I have seen a family burying a dead body just beside their newly built house. "A few days later, the rain had washed the sign of the grave away and more new refugees came and built their tent over that grave." 'I dug up one grave more than four times' Fifty-two-year-old Nur Hossain has been living in the Kutupalong registered camp for the past 26 years. He was a farmer back in Myanmar, but in Bangladesh he works in a soup factory in the camp and as a gravedigger. He came here in the early 1990s, with his wife and three sons. "The Myanmar army killed my brother Komol Hossain in early '90s. They took him to be a slave and two months later, we were informed that he had died. We ... don't know how he died," says Nur. "They [the Myanmar army] said we don't belong in Myanmar. "Along with my family members I fled to Bangladesh to save my life ... "We live like prisoners here - free but not allowed to work outside [the camps]. Even after death, we do not have a specific place [to be buried]," he says. "I dug up one grave more than four times for burial. One of our oldest graveyards is now somebody's garden." Nur says death scares him more than anything. "When I dig graves, I always say Allah's name, as [I know] I have to die some day. This fear of death haunts me all the time." 'I don't know whose grave I will share ' Nazu Mia came to Bangladesh when he was an adolescent. He's now in his early 40s, and says he's accepted his fate. "My life spent in a jail [refugee camp]. I will be here until my death and I don't know whose grave I will share in my next life after death," says the gravedigger who lives in the Kutupalong registered camp. "We buried dead bodies in the old graveyard which was allocated for the refugees of the '80s. In all graves, more than three dead bodies were buried. Now the situation is worse: people are living over new graves," he explains. "We have been asked if we need food, shelter and health assistance but no one asked if we need a bigger place for a graveyard or if we need to expand an old one. Even the place that has been allocated for new refugees is very small. In future, we might bury more than 10 dead bodies in a single grave." "We need more space for graveyards otherwise people will start digging graves in their own houses. It will take a decade to transform houses into tiny personal family graveyards," Nazu says. "Won't we get a place to rest in peace?" SOURCE: Al Jazeera News ABOUT THE AUTHOR Afrose Jahan Chaity Bangladesh Rohingya Myanmar
We are in new territory, where traditional conflict management tools are proving to be ineffective and useless, writes Blacklock [Showkat Shafi/Al Jazeera] Past couple of weeks have seen a flurry of statements and op-eds demanding that the international community do something to stop the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya in Myanmar. Among the demands made of the international community was the implementation of an arms embargo by the UN Security Council . In a report published on 17 September, Human Rights Watch requested that "The Security Council should urgently place a travel ban and asset freeze on those responsible for grave abuses and impose a comprehensive arms embargo against Burma, including prohibiting military cooperation and financial transactions with key military-owned enterprises."

(24:55) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The most useful aspect of arms embargos is that they can give the perception of something being done about gross violations of international norms. But that is pretty much where their usefulness stops. The objective of arms embargos and sanctions is to set in motion a change in policy in the target state, only achieved if the threatened sanctions outweigh the benefits which the target state expects to gain from its current policy. More importantly, sanctions are only effective when the parties applying the sanctions, and their allies, work in cooperation. Otherwise, too many avenues will be left open to subvert the sanctions. A tricky scenario in this era of international discord. The example of Yugoslavia The most compelling evidence against arms embargos as a tool for conflict management was the Yugoslav war between 1992-1995. With the end of the Cold War, Yugoslavia was no longer of strategic importance, so there was no urgency among Western nations or Russia to immediately deal with the crisis. Their eventual response was driven by domestic pressure to "do something", as we see with various statements on Rakhine today. And in the post-Cold War era, when international cooperation was at a high point, great emphasis was placed on the utility of sanctions as a diplomatic tool. But the fallout from the misperception that the international community was allied on enforcing the arms embargo would have drastic ramifications over the next four years. This largely had to do with the individual motivations and actions of the main international actors: The UK was scaling down its military and had no appetite for military intervention in the country. An arms embargo was by far the cheaper option for the British, while still being able to claim that they were "doing something". OPINION: The Srebrenicans are standing with the Rohingya In Germany , the recently reunited government was using the break-up of Yugoslavia for its own strategic goals to buy allies in the UN, paying lip service to the embargo in public while arming the Croats and Bosniaks in their fight against the Serbs in Bosnia . China has significant economic investments under way in Myanmar, as part of its 'One belt, one road' policy, and has nothing to lose and everything to gain from siding with the Myanmar government. The Russians were, at that time, extremely fearful of their own country disintegrating along ethnic lines as Yugoslavia had, and, to the contemporary scholar's astonishment, supported initiatives to sustain Yugoslav unity, including sanctions and the arms embargo. The Americans felt that the arms embargo favoured the Bosnian Serbs, cementing their military superiority against the breakaway groups throughout the country, but were compelled by domestic pressure to do something more than continue with empty rhetoric threatening military action. Publicly supporting the arms embargo, and perhaps, more importantly, its European allies, the Americans privately funnelled arms through the Croats and hoped that the balance of military power in Bosnia would even itself out to such a point as to bring the parties to the negotiating table, to avoid a costly military intervention. The way that the arms embargo and sanctions in Yugoslavia were flouted was nothing short of disastrous, affecting the factions on the ground, creating discord within the international community, changing the dynamics and perpetuating the conflict for years. However, the most important aspect of the arms embargo and sanctions regime in Yugoslavia was that the alternative would have had to have been military intervention - and the members of the Security Council were united just enough in the early 1990s that that could well have been an option. We'll never know, because it never came to that. The China factor In Myanmar , a more important factor is China , which was a non-factor in Yugoslavia. China has significant economic investments under way in Myanmar, as part of its "One belt, one road" policy , and has nothing to lose and everything to gain from siding with the Myanmar government. Domestically, the Chinese government would face no backlash for siding with the Myanmar government on the crisis in Rakhine, as narratives of insurgents and terrorism are easily controlled, and can draw strong parallels to China's own "problems" with its Uighur community. Without the Chinese to enforce sanctions and an arms embargo, there would simply be no point, and would lead only to more discord internationally that would result in less cooperation to find other solutions to the crisis. A military intervention would certainly be out of the question. OPINION: The very least the UK owes the Rohingya is protection Based on the above, why do we still see calls for sanctions and arms embargos? First, by showing the world and its constituents that it is "doing something" a government can waylay threats of military intervention. Second, it alleviates media pressure on the government, although this only works for a country that does not consider the crisis to be an issue for national security. This is relevant for neighbouring countries such as Thailand , Malaysia and Indonesia, but not for the permanent members of the Security Council , which would vote on and enforce such an embargo. Calls for arms embargos and sanctions on the government and military of Myanmar are both unreasonable and idealistic when we take a moment to assess the potential of their effectiveness. There is little hope of policy change in Myanmar if only some arms suppliers threaten to cut off trade and arm. We are in new territory, where traditional conflict management tools are proving to be ineffective and useless. We need radical new approaches to managing conflict in a multipolar world as conflict management has not kept pace with the changing nature of international relations. Thus, despite claims of "never again" after Bosnia, after Rwanda , we have nothing in our toolbox to bring opposing sides to the negotiating table to guarantee that.

The Myanmar government has engaged in at least four of the five genocidal acts outlined in the Genocide Convention against the Rohingya, writes Starr Kinseth [Showkat Shafi/Al Jazeera] On the night of August 25, an attack on Myanmar security forces by a handful of Rohingya militants in Northern Rakhine State prompted a brutal government counteroffensive that has, in turn, led to the greatest refugee crisis of the 21st century. Since then, more than 500,000 Rohingya have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh , with some estimating that as many as 15,000 continue to make the dangerous journey each day. In fact, in terms of rate of escalation, this is the greatest mass exodus - and has the makings to become the most significant humanitarian catastrophe - since the 1994 Rwandan genocide , when over 800,000 Hutus and moderate Tutsis were slaughtered over a mere 100-day period. To much of the international community, Myanmar's Rohingya crisis appears sudden, with few to no warning signs; indeed, it is only in recent weeks that the word "Rohingya" has begun to crop up in international headlines and to seep into the world's collective consciousness and conscience. Yet as a human rights lawyer who has long followed the Rohingya situation - and was present in Northern Rakhine the morning the violence erupted - I can say there is no question that the crisis unfolding now has been in the making for years, if not decades. Perhaps more importantly, by international legal and historical standards, the crisis bears all the characteristics of a genocide in bloom. {articleGUID} In fact, for those who have followed the situation closely, the use of the word "genocide" should come as no surprise. For generations, the Rohingya have faced an ever-growing list of discriminatory policies and state-sanctioned rights violations designed to cull the unwanted minority's numbers and force them from their ancestral lands: key markers of genocide. The oldest among them have seen their citizenship revoked and their children born stateless; they suffer tight restrictions on movement and access to education and healthcare; and the number of children a couple may bear has been legally limited to two. The Rohingya also regularly endure extortions for minor "offenses"; they have been barred from gathering in groups of more than five and require permission to hold routine events (like marriages); and have even faced limitations on the materials used to build or repair homes and other buildings (brick and concrete being considered too "permanent" for the unwanted minority). Direct reports from at least one prison also indicate that some prisoners from other parts of the country had been released early on condition that they resettle in Northern Rakhine in order to maximise the Buddhist population and limit Rohingya landholdings. The Rohingya have also endured periodic crackdowns designed to drive them from their land, dating at least as far back as Operation King Dragon in 1978, with more recent pogroms in 1991 and 2012. Since 2012, smaller spates of violence have erupted, each time accompanied by reports of government and mob-led village raids and burnings, rapes and murders (sometimes two-sided), and ever-increasing restrictions on Rohingya movement and activity. Yet the present crisis undoubtedly represents the most extreme and disproportionate onslaught of violence, with widely corroborated horror tales from Rohingya refugees of savagely violent gang rapes , merciless tortures and beheadings, and even babies tossed into fires . If Myanmar continues to refuse access to Northern Rakhine by neutral observers, then there will be no way for the international media to provide the balanced reporting frequently demanded by Myanmar's citizenry. If not adequately frightening on their own, these facts must be placed in a disconcertingly modern context: for there has never been a more powerful tool for the rapid dissemination of hate speech and racist-nationalist vitriol than Facebook and other social media. From a Western perspective, the dangers are easy to spot; one need only look to social media's role in recent elections and political debates to witness the rate at which false information can spread, and the surprising number of individuals who can fall prey to hateful and dangerous rhetoric, a phenomenon presently blazing across Myanmar society. Yet perhaps most disturbingly, historically, one can hardly fail to see the parallels between the current use of social media in Myanmar and that of radio in Rwanda to incite mob violence. The key exception is that social media is by all accounts an even faster, more graphic, immersive, "democratic", and ultimately, dangerous tool for the dissemination of hate speech: perhaps the most significant precursor to genocide. Still, despite these new realities, the conflict we see now may once have been preventable, if not for the dancing around international law and realpolitiking at which the world's governments have played ever since the term "genocide" first entered the international legal lexicon in the aftermath of the Holocaust. In the wake of World War II, the international community of states came together in an unprecedented manner, forming the United Nations, and - as one of its first orders of business - passing the Genocide Convention in 1948, which forbade a series of acts committed with the "intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group". {articleGUID} The Convention placed heavy weight on the use of the term "genocide" by governments - essentially requiring that, once a party to the Convention recognised that a genocide was occurring in another state, it bore a responsibility to act to stop the atrocities. Unfortunately, the planet's collective memory and joint resolve proved short-lived, as international governments - and particularly the United States - have spent decades performing mind-bending linguistic backflips to avoid public use of the term. Instead, we see politicians using turns of phrase such as "genocidal acts may have been committed" to circumvent outright use of the word itself - and in turn, to avoid violating what is perhaps international law's most sacred treaty. It thus comes as little surprise that the Rohingya crisis has until recently garnered little international attention. In fact, to date, only one world leader - France's newly-minted President Macron - has dared utter the word, vowing on September 20 to work with the Security Council to condemn "this genocide which is unfolding, this ethnic cleansing." Unfortunately, the very structure of the UN makes coordinated intervention (like deployment of a peacekeeping mission) highly unlikely, as this would surely be met by a Security Council veto by China. Indeed, such intra-UN constraints help to explain why - though many in the Office of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide have long been aware of the Rohingya crisis - the Special Adviser has spoken rarely and hesitantly on the situation. This is despite the fact that the Myanmar government has engaged in at least four of the five genocidal acts outlined in the Genocide Convention, including "killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; and imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group." But if not genocide, what might we call the horrific situation unfolding in Northern Rakhine? No doubt the "Rohingya issue" is viewed much differently throughout Myanmar, where most believe the Rohingya to be illegal Bengali migrants of questionable (or at least exceedingly "different") moral character; reproducing at a high and disproportionate rate (factually disproven); and hell-bent on Islamicising the predominantly Buddhist nation. Indeed, I have met many educated Myanmar citizens - from aid workers to fellow human rights lawyers - who carry these views, and who are quick to except the Rohingya from rights that they would otherwise view as inherent to all human beings. It is this pervasive dehumanisation of the Rohingya - backed by military and religious forces that rely on the existence of a despised "other" to maintain some semblance of power amidst Myanmar's precarious democratisation - that have allowed for the Rohingya's continuing persecution. {articleGUID} Admittedly, the atrocities we witness today in Northern Rakhine are not entirely one-sided. Surely, many Rakhine Buddhists also suffer the effects of conflict, and international media should also report on this suffering. Yet having visited many Rohingya and Rakhine villages, and remaining in touch with many Rohingya and Rakhine contacts, I also could not in good conscience equate the two groups' experiences or poverty levels, as many in Myanmar print and social media circles routinely demand of international observers. Rakhine Buddhists are surely poorer than most ethnic groups in Myanmar (excepting, perhaps, only the Rohingya), and many do currently suffer alongside the Rohingya in terms of physical and food security. However, it would be false to suggest that as many Rakhine Buddhist villages have been looted and razed, or as many Rakhine Buddhist individuals raped, tortured, slaughtered, or otherwise victimised, as have the Rohingya. And while I know of some Rakhine Buddhists who have also become internally displaced - no doubt under deeply abhorrent circumstances - the fact is they possess the freedom of movement to do so and a greater chance of attaining aid and even alternative livelihoods elsewhere in Myanmar. All that said, if Myanmar continues to refuse access to Northern Rakhine by neutral observers, then there will be no way for the international media to provide the balanced reporting frequently demanded by Myanmar's citizenry. Instead, as it stands, we outside observers must rely either on our own direct experience to date - as I have here - or on reports flooding across the border from, one must imagine, the most vulnerable Rohingya. In the meantime, it appears that the international community of states, favouring inaction, has tiptoed around such deeply disturbing refugee accounts for far too long. And from the perspective of an international lawyer, based on the information that is presently available to outsiders, there can only be one word for the Rohingya experience in Myanmar: and that word is genocide.

The question of the Rohingya is not merely connected to human rights issues, but also to the issue of civil rights including the right to self-identification, writes Iqbal [Showkat Shafi/Al Jazeera] Clarifying on its nomenclature, the Annan Commission Report on the Rakhine (Arakan) State ( pdf ), notes that "In line with the request of the State Counsellor [Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi ], the Commission uses neither the term 'Bengali' nor 'Rohingya', who are referred to as 'Muslims' or 'the Muslim community in Rakhine". Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5587641075001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5587641075001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: One month into Rohingya crisis, refugees still fleeing (2:25) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY This left the Commission with the only option of referring to the crisis in Rakhine from the vantage point of universal human rights, rather than the question of historical antecedents. Yet the request from Suu Ki and the Commission's compliance to not mention the terms "Bengali" or "Rohingya" will stand against future measures to implement the Commission's recommendations for restoring citizenship to the Rohingyas. This is because the question of the Rohingya is not merely connected to human rights issues, but also to the issue of civil rights including the right to self-identification. The bone of contention for the Myanmar military and the country's State Council is that the Rohingyas are "Bengalis" from Bangladesh who speak Bangla language. How may we respond to this claim that would bring stakeholders from Bangladesh, Myanmar and International community closer for a durable solution to the crisis? Answers to this question abound in different phases of the region's history. Rakhine before decolonisation: From a cosmopolitan society to national space The history of Rakhine is rich and greatly connected to Arab-Persian cultural world since at least the early 8th century and with Bengal/Bangladesh region from much earlier times. Muslim Sufis and traders had interactions with the coastal regions of what is today's Bangladesh and Rakhine and all the way to the Indian Ocean rim of wider Southeast Asia. Conversion to Islam took place in areas that fall within the current borders of both Myanmar and Bangladesh. In 1406, the Rakhine king Nara Meikhla was dethroned by an invading Bamar/Burmese force and was driven to Bengal. He was later able to regain his throne with the help of 30,000 soldiers sent by the Bengal Sultan, Jalal al Din. Rakhine kings used to send tribute to Bengal Muslim Sultans for a considerable period of time. However, during the transition period between the decline of independent Muslim rulers of Bengal and the arrival of the Mughals from northern India, Bangladesh's port city Chittagong came under the Rakhine rulers for some time. READ MORE: Myanmar: Who are the Rohingya? Despite these political changes, Rakhine developed a cosmopolitan culture that retained Buddhist as well as Muslim and Hindu pedigree. Rakhine kings issued coins that contained the imprint of the Buddha and the Kalema, the fundamental article of faith in Islam, until early seventeenth century. Medieval forms of Bengali literature were patronised in this cosmopolitan atmosphere where Pali, Arabic and Persian were also in vogue. Poet Alalol from today's Bangladesh, who was kidnapped by Portuguese pirates and sold in Rakhine as a slave, ended up being a court poet in the capital of Rakhine, where he was patronised by many Muslim ministers of Buddhist kings. Alaol in his poems written in mid-seventeenth century introduced Rosango, a variant of the term Rohango (Rohingya), as the capital city of Rakhine. The early postcolonial policy of the Burmese government towards the Rohingya was consistent with the pluralistic cultural and religious heritage of Myanmar and inclusive national vision of Aung San, Suu Kyi's illustrious father. Meanwhile, the Bamars kept knocking at the borders of Rakhine and finally captured its throne in 1784, leaving the Rakhine people, of both Buddhist and Muslim origin, to face unprecedented persecution in their ancestral land. Most of them fled to Chittagong region across the Naaf river. While some of them returned to Rakhine, some stayed behind who are still known as Rakhine Buddhists, currently numbering more than 100,000. They are now Bangladeshi citizens and Bangladesh has never suggested their ouster because of their ancestry in Myanmar. It needs mentioning that despite initial persecution of local Rakhine people by the Bamar forces, there were also the gradual realisation of the need of the support and engagement of local people, including the Muslims. One example was that until the British took over Burma in early nineteenth century, the Burmese king had given charge of the Port of Rangoon (Yangon) to a Muslim merchant. The British period saw a different kind of mobility across today's Bangladesh-Myanmar border, which was more of a planned mobilisation of people from all over India, Bengalis from Chittagong being the majority who were involved in professional, commercial and agricultural activities. By the 1930s however, the Bengalis, as well as other Indian diasporic communities, came into conflict with local inhabitants and with the coming of the Japanese during the World War sealed the fate of the Indians in Burma, most of whom had to return to India and Bengal under strenuous conditions. Those few who left behind were clearly distinguished from local Rohingya people. Postcolonial period: From citizen to stateless The early postcolonial policy of the Burmese government towards the Rohingya was consistent with the pluralistic cultural and religious heritage of Myanmar and inclusive national vision of Aung San, Suu Kyi's illustrious father. The Muslims of Rakhine including the Rohingyas were no longer living in the rich political and social heritage of precolonial times, but there was no question about their place in Burma's mainstream public life. In the two general elections of 1951 and 1956, at least eleven Rohingyas, including women, returned to Burmese Parliament as MPs. IN PICTURES: Rohingya refugees search for shelter in Bangladesh During the 1990 general election that followed the anti-military resistance led by Suu Kyi, Rohingyas were her political allies and won four seats for her National Democratic League for Human Rights. But in the next stage of the unfinished journey to democracy in Myanmar, the paths of Suu Kyi and her erstwhile Rohingya allies diverged tragically. As of 2017, no Rohingyas could vote and there is no Rohingya MPs left in Myanmar. There is no instance in the world where after decades of experience of citizenship and of exercising the rights to electing their representative to parliament an entire population becomes stateless without security to life, property and honour, except of course in Nazi Germany. It's an irony that Suu Kyi's ascendancy to Myanmar statecraft coincides with the collateral destruction of her erstwhile political allies.

But the law came as an utter shock and surprise, given the positive developments in the preceding years. In the middle of a renewed spell of the flow of the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, heads of states of the two countries had exchanged state visits before the signing of a historic "Repatriation Agreement" in Dhaka on 9 July 1978. In the agreement, the Burmese government promised the "repatriation at the earliest of the lawful residents of Burma" and also to repatriate those who were "able to furnish evidences of their residence in Burma, such as addresses or any other particulars". Under this agreement the Burmese government launched the Hintha project which oversaw the repatriation of more than 29,000 families comprising 177,000 refugees from Bangladesh to their former places of residence. The current practice of burning the habitat and homestead of the Rohingyas by the Burmese security forces seems to aim at preemptively forestalling any chance of return of the Rohingyas as Myanmar citizens in light of the agreement of 1978. What's next? The Annan Commission was formed at the request of Aung San Suu Kyi and Bangladesh government agreed on most of its recommendations. This initial consensus must build on the recognition of the Rohingya identity - because seen either in historical, political, legislative or diplomatic antecedents, the Rohingyas cannot be considered as anything but the citizens of Myanmar. True, as many commentators suggest, there are other powerful agents that complicate the situation. The idea of liberal democratic practice drawing on cosmopolitan and pluralistic world views may not find an easy place in this quagmire where geo-strategy, trade routes and pipelines call the shots. OPINION: An arms embargo on Myanmar would not save the Rohingya But taking away one's honour is not going to solve the existential threat posed to the Rohingyas. What it all takes is the pressing of the softer button of goodwill, empathy and justice. Who has the hand on this button is not clear to those outside Myanmar, but there are two clear paths of other kinds for Mrs Suu Kyi which can set a positive tone in the current situation and taking up one of them can secure her rightful place in history. Both Gautama Buddha and the Emperor Ashoka were tormented by the existential sufferings, bloodshed and death in society. Buddha renounced all earthly ambition because he found no path higher than the path of ending these sufferings of humanity through annihilation of desire. On the other hand, the great Ashoka, who spread Buddhism in Myanmar among other places, consolidated and used his power in order to spread the word and practice of non-violence. Mrs Suu Kyi may wish to let the world know, sooner than later, about her own pathfinder: Gautama Buddha or Ashoka? Anything shorter than that would be equal to an aggression on the very core of Buddhism itself. Rohingya and Iftekhar Iqbal is a historian at the University of Dhaka.

Rohingya refugee children carry supplies through Balukhali refugee camp near Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, October 23, 2017 [Hannah McKay/Reuters] Nine-year-old Hamida* has a bandage wrapped around her head and vacant eyes that suggest her mind and body are worlds apart. I've never seen a child's face look so empty. Her uncle Ali, who cares for her now - despite her being the eleventh mouth he must feed - says she rarely speaks any more. That is, until dusk each evening. That's when the terror returns. "She starts to cry and scream out for her mother," Ali says. "During the day she's OK, but everything changes at nightfall. She feels a lot of pain. She cannot sleep." I learn that Hamida's mother, father and three brothers were all killed by the Myanmar military forces. Her entire immediate family wiped out in a few minutes. Soldiers entered their village in Myanmar's northern Rakhine State and opened fire, setting homes ablaze and killing indiscriminately. In the chaotic scramble for life, people fled into the jungle, including Hamida. There was no time to take anything or save her family. {articleGUID} It was a brutal, planned massacre, says Ali, whose parents were murdered, too. Thankfully, a group of villagers decided to take care of Hamida. Carrying nothing but the clothes on their backs, they walked for days on end, up and down mountains and through driving rain. Battered and bruised, they eventually made it to Bangladesh 's Cox's Bazar district, which is now home to some 800,000 Rohingya , including over half a million who've arrived in the past seven weeks. Most have taken refuge in the makeshift settlements less than an hours walk from the Naf River, which divides the two countries here. They can still see the hills of Myanmar on the other side. Ali tells me he searched everywhere for Hamida, and eventually caught word that she was in a local hospital. In a time of endless despair, this reunion was a rare joy. I've deployed to a lot of humanitarian crises over the past five years including places like South Sudan, Iraq and Afghanistan. But I've never seen anything like this, where so many people - especially children - are so visibly distressed or traumatised. The settlements themselves are a sight to behold. Once lush green hills have been stripped bare. Terraces have been cut into the clay to make space for more bamboo and plastic shelters. When it rains the ground turns into a series of muddy waterfalls, and dirty, contaminated water pools everywhere. The roads inside the camps are a hive of activity, with large trucks plundering up and down carrying tonnes of aid. Shirtless men run large bundles of bamboo while lone children wander in search of food, money or something to do. Umbrellas are everywhere, protecting people from the harsh sun or heavy rains - it feels as though there's nothing in-between. This foreign place is home for Hamida for now, along with more than 300,000 other newly arrived Rohingya children, many of whom spend their days in a similar trauma-induced daze. {articleGUID} Over the past few weeks, I have interviewed nearly two dozen Rohingya women, men and children about what happened in Myanmar and what their lives have become in Bangladesh. Every single one of them told similar stories of deadly attacks on villages and desperate escapes. The heartbreak is everywhere. The interviews were raw and emotional. Women wept before my eyes as they recounted their relatives being killed and their homes being turned into a blaze of raging fire. I've deployed to a lot of humanitarian crises over the past five years including places like South Sudan , Iraq and Afghanistan. But I've never seen anything like this, where so many people - especially children - are so visibly distressed or traumatised. Dealing with this trauma will form a critical part of the humanitarian response. Already agencies like Save the Children are running dozens of special playgroups for younger children known as "child-friendly spaces". But what's really needed is education. School isn't just about learning; it provides routine and a sense of normality, a place where children can make friends, play and remember what it's like to be children. It's also a critical form of protection from exploitation and abuse, such as trafficking. Yet right now, more than 450,000 school-aged Rohingya children aren't going to school. Ensuring children can access education in emergencies like this saves lives. Seeing the haunted faces of so many traumatised children like Hamida, I've never been surer of this. *Name changed to protect the identity of the child.

More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled the country since late August [Anadolu] The United States is considering sanctions against Myanmar authorities for its "violent, traumatic abuses" of the majority Muslim Rohingya in restive Rakhine state. Washington may use a human rights law to target leaders or groups involved in the violence in the western state, the US Department of State said in a statement on Monday. "We express our gravest concern with recent events in Rakhine state and the violent, traumatic abuses Rohingya and other communities have endured," the statement said. "It is imperative that any individuals or entities responsible for atrocities, including non-state actors and vigilantes, be held accountable." {articleGUID} Since August 25, the Myanmar army has waged a brutal military campaign in Rakhine against the Rohingya . More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled the country, most arriving in Bangladesh by foot or by boat, with aid agencies struggling to cope with the influx. "We are exploring accountability mechanisms available under US law, including Global Magnitsky targeted sanctions," Heather Nauert, State Department spokesperson, said. Under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, the president can block or revoke the visas of certain foreign individuals and entities or impose property sanctions on them. The US government last imposed sanctions on Myanmar in 1997 when it was under a military dictatorship. Following a transition towards democracy, the measures were lifted in October 2016 by then President Barack Obama . Benjamin Zawacki, an independent Southeast Asia analyst, said while the proposed sanctions are far more appropriate, if imposed, they come a month late. "Any preventative element of these sanctions has long passed its sell-by date," he told Al Jazeera, speaking from Thailand's capital, Bangkok. "The only thing left now is the punitive element, and it remains to be seen whether they will be felt as such by these generals that have been targeted."

Zawacki suggested that an arms embargo would be effective against the military. "If there is, in fact, no punitive effect on these generals, they [sanctions] need to be strengthened and widened by way of military force projection," he said. Last week, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that the US holds Myanmar's military leadership responsible for its harsh crackdown of the Rohingya. The UN describes the Rohingya as the world's most persecuted people. The minority group has suffered years of discrimination and have been denied citizenship in Myanmar since 1982.

A crying Rohingya girl fleeing ongoing violence Fears grow as a cascade of cancellations ripples through Myanmar’s fledgling tourism industry, with shocking images of burnt villages and Muslim Rohingya fleeing army-led violence in western Rakhine state sparking global outrage. With more than half a million Rohingya forced to flee to neighboring Bangladesh in two months, carrying testimony of killings, rape and arson at the hands of soldiers and Buddhist mobs, Myanmar’s fledgling tourism sector could collapse back to its dark days under military rule. Ever since the bloodshed broke out in late August, tourism operators have witnessed a torrent of cancellations in the emerging industry that was gearing up for its high season in October. "Almost all the trips scheduled for October and November have been cancelled due to instability in the country, because of the situation in Rakhine state," said Tun Tun Naing from New Fantastic Asia Travels and Tour, an agency that leads trips to the pristine beaches and mist-shrouded lakes that dot the lush country. "Most groups in Japan, Australia and other Asian countries cited security reasons and some Europeans have clearly said they boycotted because of the humanitarian situation." Leaders from the UK, US, France, Canada and Australia have urged Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi to push for an end to violence against the Rohingya, but so far, she has failed to explicitly condemn the killings, which Human Rights Watch UN Director Louis Charbonneau has called an "ethnic cleansing campaign". There is a need for "strong UN action to compel Myanmar security services to end their ethnic cleansing campaign", Charbonneau said. In Yangon, a bustling city known for its crumbling colonial architecture, some foreign tourists could still be seen circling the gilded Shwedagon Pagoda that looms over the former capital. But they admitted that the ongoing crisis is an awkward backdrop for their holiday. "It's very sad to see what the country is becoming, our guide told us that Muslims were dangerous and that they were not Burmese," said French tourist Christine, who declined to give her surname. Some distinguished guests are also keeping their distance, with Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, and his wife Camilla deciding to skip a stop in the former colony during an autumn tour of Asia. The refugee crisis could throw Myanmar's fledgling tourism sector back to the dark days under military rule, when many travelers passed over the pariah state to avoid lining the pockets of generals who brutally suppressed human rights. All that had started to change after the army initiated a transition to partial democracy in 2011. The move saw Western sanctions lifted, as foreign tourists flocked to landscapes unspoiled by the crowds and the travel infrastructure that has mushroomed elsewhere in the region. The first half of 2017 kicked off well with a 22 percent increase in visitors compared to the previous year, according to figures from the Ministry of Tourism, which hopes to double the number of annual arrivals to 7.5 million by 2020. But at the end of August, western Rakhine state was in flames. A few hours south of the conflict zone in Rakhine state lies Mrauk-U, an ancient capital and hallowed archaeological site. Two months into the crisis, locals say the site is empty of the tourists normally buzzing around its ruins. "All people who live on tourism are out of work now," said guide Aung Soe Myint.

People hold photos of Aung San Suu Kyi during an inter-faith ceremony in Yangon in early October [Soe Zeya Tun/Reuters] Yangon, Myanmar - As the sun set and shops and offices closed for the day, Maha Bandoola park started to fill with people. Some were here on Tuesday to enjoy the green grounds, a small refuge from the noise and chaos of downtown Yangon. But many more arrived for an inter-faith prayer event organised by the ruling party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), held outside the City Hall building across the road. The event was called "Peace in Myanmar - Ceremony for Inter-Faith Prayers." Critics say it's not difficult to view the inter-faith prayer events as nothing more than public relations exercises. It was the last in a series of events in the country amid a crisis in the western Rakhine state from where more than 600,000 Rohingya have been forced to flee into neighbouring Bangladesh . The crisis erupted after a group of armed Rohingya fighters attacked border posts and an army base on August 25, killing 12 security officers and provoking a fierce crackdown by Myanmar's military. Since then, hundreds of Rohingya civilians have been killed by security forces, women and girls raped, and villages torched. The United Nations human rights chief has described the situation as "textbook ethnic cleansing". Myanmar's government has blamed misinformation for distorting the crisis. Call to prayer In the words of Nyan Win, the NLD's spokesperson, Tuesday's event was held so people can pray for peace in the country, and to show that Myanmar is a "multi-religious and diverse society". {articleGUID} Monks, imams, and priests sat together. Politicians, civil servants, and community leaders came too. Religious leaders from different faiths took to the stage, in turn, to lead the group in prayer and some delivered speeches, preaching harmony and doing right by others. Khin Marlar Htwe, a Yangon resident, told Al Jazeera what motivated her to attend. "It's what good citizens should do. This event can help us achieve unity. It's important to have open communication with people of other religions so we can have a good relationship with them," Khin Marlar Htwe said. Sann Aung, a lawyer, said he welcomed inter-faith gatherings as opposed to events organised by hardline nationalists in Myanmar , which he said only "attacked people". Pro-military rallies have been held across the country recently ; they have criticised Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi , and painted the majority-Muslim Rohingya in Rakhine as a group of "extremists" intent on creating an Islamic state. For an event held partially in response to the violence in Rakhine state, there was no mention of the Rohingya at Tuesday's gathering.

Soseong-ri is a battleground in the fight against perceived US militarism [Dena Takruri/Al Jazeera] "F***ing pack up your f***ing THAAD and get the f*** out of here!" You wouldn't expect to hear that many f-bombs dropped by a frail 85-year-old grandma living in South Korea's rural countryside. But for Jang Kyun Sun, her peaceful agricultural village of Soseong-ri, located more than 200km southeast of Seoul, is now the latest battleground in the fight against perceived US militarism in her country. And she is very upset.

Tokyo, Japan - The frequent tests and growing sophistication of North Korean missiles is prompting the Japanese government and the general public to think carefully about civil defence. What if Pyongyang actually did fire missiles at a major Japanese city? An opinion poll published by the Japan News Network at the beginning of May found that 90 percent of the public admitted feeling worried about North Korea and 54 percent said that they were greatly worried. Each year, we have received only one or two orders to build underground shelters ... but now that the people have become afraid of North Korean missiles, there are many who want our shelters. We've become very busy. Akira Shiga, manager at the Shizuoka-based company, Earth Shift The conservative government of Shinzo Abe , the Liberal Democratic Party leader who became Japan's prime minister in 2012 , has tried to respond to these fears in part by giving assurances that it is working hard to fulfil its duty to defend the nation. But there are also suggestions that the government is more subtly stoking these concerns just enough to assist it in its long-term agenda of dispensing with the remnants of the nation's post-war pacifism and moving towards constitutional revision. There were certainly mixed reviews when Tokyo Metro, a subway company that serves millions of commuters in the Japanese capital, shut down all of its train lines for about 10 minutes on the morning of April 29 in response to news reports that North Korea had fired a missile . While some commentators appreciated the abundance of caution shown by the company, others pointed out that even in Seoul, the capital of South Korea , which is much closer to the danger zone, no such measures have ever been taken. This criticism led Tokyo Metro to quickly change its company policy. In the future, the subway trains will be halted only if an official warning is issued through the J-Alert system of the Fire and Disaster Management Agency (FDMA), and not in response to media reports. The J-Alert system is a fundamental pillar of Japan's civil defence measures. First launched in 2007, the system involves the FDMA sending out a warning signal via satellite that is to be received by Japanese local governments, which in turn warn the general public about the emergency through loudspeakers and other broadcasts. By 2014, all local governments throughout the nation were provided with the necessary receivers and were woven into the J-Alert system. OPINION: Is war coming to North Korea? People in Seoul watch a broadcast about North Korea's fourth missile test in four weeks on June 8. Early this month, following Pyongyang's repeated missile tests, the UN Security Council expanded sanctions against North Korea [Chung Sung-jun/Getty Images] Drills and bomb shelters Some local governments are now beginning to organise public drills. On June 11, for example, a drill was held in Fukuyama city. It was the first such exercise within the Hiroshima Prefecture. About 150 elderly local residents gathered in the outer yard of an elementary school and were exposed to the peculiar drone of the J-Alert system, which most of them had never before heard. They then filed into the school gymnasium, their evacuation point. So far, drills involving the public seem to be occurring only in a handful of regional cities. A visit to the disaster preparation section of Tokyo's Chiyoda Ward, which includes the Imperial Palace and the seat of the national government, discovered little evidence of any special missile defence preparations. Most recently, governing party politician Ryota Takeda has been leading the Study Team for Civil Protection. This team is expected to propose that many buildings and underground areas be designated as shelters in the event of a missile attack or a similar calamity, and that even underground shelters be constructed for the specific purpose of civil defence. READ MORE: North Korea's nuclear weapons - Here is all we know In this regard, some members of the public are not waiting for the government to act. Al Jazeera English spoke by telephone to Akira Shiga, manager at the Shizuoka-based company Earth Shift, which is believed to be the only private enterprise in Japan that currently builds bomb shelters. "Each year, we have received only one or two orders to build underground shelters," Shiga explains, "but now that the people have become afraid of North Korean missiles, there are many who want our shelters. We've become very busy." A year ago, he adds, Earth Shift would receive roughly one call a week from a customer interested in building a shelter. Now, they are receiving 10 to 30 calls each business day. Despite such activity, there are strong reasons to doubt that the government will go beyond efforts to educate the public and to prepare emergency services. Representative Takeda's notion of building underground shelters has distinct limitations. The population of the greater Tokyo area alone is estimated at around 37.8 million people. It is thought that a missile fired from North Korea would land in Tokyo approximately 10 minutes after it is launched. Under such circumstances, any civil defence measures, such as the building of underground shelters, would be both prohibitively expensive and of quite modest utility. Military anti-missile systems such as Aegis Ashore or THAAD are essentially the only line of defence. The rest is mainly about easing public fears and perhaps channelling them into lanes that better suit the governing party's political objectives.

RenderPagesVideo('5563467027001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Since Kim Jong-un's ascendancy in December 2011, North Korea has accelerated its missile development programme, the tempo of tests increasing considerably from those under his father Kim Jong Il. After failures in 2016, North Korea has this year made bold advances in its missile programme. The country conducted its sixth nuclear test on September 3, 2017, setting off a magnitude 6.3 earthquake with a depth of 23 kilometres near its Punggye-ri nuclear test site. North Korean officials claimed the hydrogen bomb tested is more advanced with an estimated yield of up to 100 kilotonnes - roughly four to five times stronger than the bomb dropped on Japan's Nagasaki - which can be loaded onto an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). This follows a month of escalating tension over the country's weapons development programme with new UN sanctions, more missile tests, threats of nuclear attack exchanged by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, and international calls for de-escalation and to "dial down rhetoric and dial up diplomacy". The series of events follow North Korean displays of improvements in missile delivery technology. Just a month prior, on July 28, North Korea launched its first long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), claiming it demonstrated the capability of the missiles to reach the US mainland. This test came just weeks after Pyongyang tested its first ICBM. Read this related article to find out more about North Korea's five previous nuclear tests from 2006-2017 Here are three of North Korea's recent technical milestones in long-range missile technology which stand out and why they matter. 1. Firing almost vertically and reaching higher altitudes There are significant challenges to testing a long-range missile in a country that is too small to run test flights within its own border. Initially, North Korea's only option was to launch these flights over its neighbours. It did that in 1998 by test-firing the Taepodong-1 missile over mainland Japan, to instant international condemnation. Now, North Korea has started launching longer-range missiles in what is known as a "lofted trajectory", firing the missile almost vertically. This allows the missile to land a short horizontal distance from launch but travel a great distance overall. Higher altitudes are a strong indication of new, more powerful engines and a greater ability to carry a payload that distance. These launches enable Pyongyang to conduct realistic tests of longer-range missiles. They also allow engineers to gather data sent back from the test missile to better understand the challenges faced when a long-range warhead re-enters the Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds, something that generates vast amounts of frictional heat. This is exactly what North Korea did when it tested the Hwasong-14 (Mars-14) on July 4. According to the US military's Pacific Command, or PACOM, which monitors these launches, it flew for 37 minutes , rising to a maximum altitude (known as an apogee) of nearly 2,800km, over seven times higher than the International Space Station which is in orbit only some 400km above the Earth. A steep, near-vertical launch allowed the missile to travel a distance that roughly simulated long-range flight by travelling higher than most missiles but splashing down only a short distance away into the Sea of Japan, limiting the diplomatic damage that would inevitably be caused by a random projectile flying through a neighbour's airspace. The ICBM, a clunky Cold War-era name for a long-range missile, is formally defined as one that can fly more than 5,500km. According to David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists, if the Hwasong-14 was fired under proper flight conditions, it could reach a target more than 6,700km away. This puts the missile firmly in the long-range or ICBM bracket, and means it could potentially hit the US base on the island of Guam as well as Alaska, although the naval base on Hawaii and the rest of the continental US are still out of reach. READ MORE: North Korea tensions: All the latest updates 2. Solid fuel means faster launches First tested by the North just over a decade , ago solid-fuelled missiles are faster to set up and easier to fire. Unlike liquid fuels, which take time to load and are extremely toxic and corrosive to handle, solid fuels are easier to maintain and are more stable. A crude analogy between the two is to liken solid-fuelled missiles to setting off gunpowder-filled fireworks rather than filling each one with liquid fuel every time you wanted to fire one. Solid fuel reduces launch times from hours to minutes. Reducing the time from when a missile battery is taken out into the open to be readied for a launch, and therefore is exposed to enemy observation, makes it far less likely to be discovered and destroyed. Using solid fuels also scales back on the additional vehicles needed to transport volatile and dangerous liquid fuels, making a missile battery smaller and harder to spot. As this fuel is more stable, it can also take a few knocks when moved around. 3. Toughening up missile batteries Fortifying a missile battery so it can travel anywhere on land rather than along North Korea's tiny road system - the country has 724km of paved and 24,830km of unpaved roads respectively - gives it more places to hide. North Korea has done this by ruggedising the missile transporter (formally called a transporter erector launcher or TEL). Tracks are used instead of wheels, allowing the heavy vehicles to cross rough ground off the road system, which would be monitored by an enemy trying to track down missile batteries. The thin-skinned missile is also sheathed in a canister so it survives bumpy off-road travel. These improvements came together in the successful February launch of the Pukguksong-2 (Polaris-2) medium-range missile. Analysts across the world quickly realised the test's importance as the combination of solid fuel, a ruggedised transporter and a protected weapon, meant a battery could potentially hide in forests, underneath cliff overhangs, under bridges - virtually anywhere - and launch within minutes from a cold start. What is next for North Korea's missile programme? Producing next-generation missiles that can reach the US will be key for North Korea. This will not be an easy feat given the trickier aspects of long-range flight. Designs must be able to withstand the stresses and incredible heat produced in missiles by re-entering the atmosphere. The challenges will come from improving the warhead and delivery system and coupling the two. North Korean scientists will struggle to extend the missiles' ranges while shrinking their still rudimentary nuclear devices so theý are light enough to be carried by the missile to the target. Then there is the quest for accuracy, if the missiles are to have any military use. North Korea has bragged that its latest batch of missile tests were extremely accurate. It is still vague how this accuracy is being assessed given that North Korea does not have a network of satellites able to guide distant warheads to their targets, relying on the projectiles' much less accurate inertial guidance system. This electronic system is used in older missiles such as the Scud. It works on the principle of the missile using internally measured basic data on its speed, direction, and so on, to try to roughly assess where it ended up rather than being told where it was exactly by, say, the Global Positioning System (GPS). If the sharp tempo of tests doesn't abate, North Korea is likely to see substantial improvements in its missile programme. Kim Jong-un seems determined to "frequently send big and small 'gift packages' to the Yankees", as he instructed scientists after the July 4 test of the first ICBM, according to the country's state media KCNA.

RenderPagesVideo('5550034537001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Lihue, Hawaii - The frequency of activity has increased but the pattern remains predictable: a defiant North Korean missile test followed by provocative war games, then another missile launch, more angry threats and warnings, followed by counter-threats and new sanctions, and now a sixth nuclear test and more severe warnings and accusations. In this geopolitical tit-for-tat, Asia-Pacific communities that host US military bases watch cautiously as fiery rhetoric pushes the two nuclear-armed adversaries ever-closer to what would be a catastrophic war. The island of Guam came into sharp focus in August when North Korea announced plans to fire four Hwasong-12 ballistic missiles near the US territory following President Donald Trump 's threat to unleash "fire and fury like the world has never seen" against North Korea . Guam's Pacific Daily News reported that a missile launched from North Korea could reach Guam and its more than 160,000 US citizens in just 14 minutes. As Guam residents were being advised how to prepare for a possible nuclear strike , President Trump cheerfully assured Guam's governor that the extra media attention would boost the island's tourism industry. "You've become extremely famous all over the world," Trump said, promising the US territory's governor that tourism would increase "tenfold with the expenditure of no money." "Like a spear into battle" But on an island labelled with the tagline "Where America's Day Begins , " many of its residents long for the day when American militarism ends. "The US military likes to couch their activities in solely defensive metaphors," says Michael Lujan Bevacqua, a Chamorro studies professor at the University of Guam. "The reference to Guam as 'the tip of the spear'," he says, "offers a sliver of truth." Bevacqua argues that like other empires, the US describes its foreign presence as a source of order and safety, "never the destabilising force … even if it takes land and resources, even if it poisons the earth, even if it depresses or constricts the local economy." The US military likes to couch their activities in solely defensive metaphors. Michael Lujan Bevacqua, University of Guam The US military presence can be characterised as a shield with a giant target on it, Bevacqua suggests. In Guam, it is "really the source of the danger just as much as a source of defence". As a US possession ( non-self governing territory ) without voting rights, Guam will be "dragged along like a spear into battle," Bevacqua notes. "Whether the spear loves battle or would prefer peace is irrelevant, as our purpose is to be something used in a fight and little more." Michael Lujan Bevacqua uses a map to show where US bases on Guam are located. The military occupies nearly one-third of the island [Jon Letman] Vivian Dames, a retired faculty member of the University of Guam, says: "All of these islands in Micronesia, regardless of political status, have some sort of political affiliation with the United States because of the US' long-standing strategic interest in this region and they all serve the function of being the westernmost, forward defence for the United States." Dames is referring to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands around 200km north of Guam and the vast sweep of ocean where the military conducts year-round training and live-fire testing and which the military seeks to expand to an area larger than much of the western United States . "While these islands, especially the Marianas, are strategically very important to the US," Dames says, "most Americans know very little about us and the ongoing effects of American militarism." A short drive from the University of Guam, Andersen Air Force Base is the staging grounds for a continuous bomber presence that includes B1-B bombers and B2 Spirit bombers which are capable of carrying B61 tactical nuclear weapons and the B83, a thermonuclear weapon 60 times more destructive than the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. Increasingly, bombers based at Andersen conduct precision strike exercises and in July the 37th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron deployed to Guam from South Dakota, arming the island with a pre-emptive attack force capable of an offensive attack. Guam also has a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) antimissile battery, Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station and an 18,000 acre Naval Ordnance Annex. Naval Base Guam is the home port for fast attack nuclear and non-nuclear submarines. Beyond this sign sits Anderson Air Force Base on Guam's northernmost point Litekyan (Ritidian). The US military plans to build a live-fire traning range complex in the area on land many indigenous Chamorro people consider sacred [Jon Letman/Al Jazeera] Guam is not the only place From the US military's perspective, Guam is essential to maintaining a "ready to fight tonight " capability, but to North Korea, this much firepower from a hostile adversary represents a lethal threat. In August, as tensions threatened to boil over, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Guam where he said: "The North Korean missile capability can point in many directions. So, Guam is not the only place that would be under threat." This stark reality is all too well known across the Asia-Pacific region where many communities host US bases. Between Guam and North Korea, the US has over 180 military bases, installations and more than 90,000 troops who train alongside their allies Japan and South Korea which represent the eighth and 10th largest global military expenditures. In South Korea, the US is consolidating its bases but will also soon claim the largest overseas US military base in Pyeongtaek, 64km south of Seoul. Although South Korea arguably faces the most imminent threat from North Korea, many South Koreans await the day when the US will finally leave. More than six decades after an armistice halted the 1950-53 Korean War, longtime peace activist retired Catholic priest Father Mun Jeong-hyeon asks : "Why Korea was divided? Why is the USA stationed in this country for a long time?"

She's referring to a nationwide network of more than 100 US bases that run the length of the country, with the greatest concentration in Okinawa. "North Korea understandably declared US bases in Japan would be their target," she says. Norimatsu stresses the importance of viewing local demilitarisation movements like those in Okinawa, Guam and elsewhere in a larger context and says there's a need for multinational, multilingual efforts against US militarism across the region.

Photograph taken in June, 2015 [Jon Letman/Al Jazeera] Okinawa - 'Keystone of the Pacific' In a 1956 US Army propaganda film , the narrator states: "To exploit Okinawa's strategic location, major commands were moved here a few years ago from Japan. This has created a fluid force poised to move anywhere at a moment's notice. The defence of the island is of primary concern. Tactical training never stops." Seventy-two years after the Battle of Okinawa in which one-quarter to one-third of the civilian population was killed, roughly half of the 55,800 US forces in Japan remain stationed in Okinawa. With the large concentration of US military bases, Okinawa is a perfect target for foreign military aggression. Hideki Yoshikawa, director of Okinawa Environmental Justice Project In 1972, the US relinquished direct military control of Okinawa to Japan but still operates over 30 military installations and continues to build more by force . Global sociology Professor Kosuzu Abe of the University of the Ryukyus describes the continued US presence in Okinawa as "too large, too long and too dangerous". Tens of thousands of colorful origami folded paper cranes hang on a memorial at the Himeyuri Peace Museum honouring students who were killed in the Battle of Okinawa in 1945. The bitter memories of war have fuelled a passionate anti-military sentiment on this island in southernmost Japan. Photograph taken in June, 2015 [Jon Letman/Al Jazeera] "Accepting a foreign military for such a long period ruins the health of the local economy and our community," says Abe, who teaches at a university campus where US military aircraft regularly fly overhead. Besides the threat of living among dozens of military bases, Okinawans face the danger of external attack in the event of war. Hideki Yoshikawa, director of Okinawa Environmental Justice Project, insists US bases don't protect his home island. "With the large concentration of US military bases, Okinawa is a perfect target for foreign military aggression," he says. Yoshikawa points out that because US installations built surrounded by densely populated Okinawan cities, "any aggression directed at US military bases in Okinawa would have spillover effects on our civilian population." Yoshikawa imagines a future Okinawa free of US bases in which his people could pursue a UN-sanctioned international non-military zone, a concept backed by many base opponents. Read about the Okinawans standing against a US military base Living in a state of 'strategic denial' The danger of being used by the US military is tragically familiar to the people of the Marshall Islands where the US tested 67 nuclear bombs between 1946-1958, leaving behind a legacy of sickness, death and forced displacement. Today, the US continues to test offensive weapons in the Marshall Islands, using Kwajalein Atoll as a target for unarmed Minuteman III ICBMs. In addition to missile and rocket testing from the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site at Kwajalein, the US claims the right of " strategic denial" which gives it exclusive military control over more than half a million square miles of air, land and sea between Hawaii and Guam as provision of compacts of free association between the US and three Micronesian nations. Desmond Doulatram, a representative of an NGO called Radiation Exposure Awareness Crusaders for Humanity - Marshall Islands (REACH-MI) says: "One can rightfully argue that Kwajalein is also becoming a huge liability … the presence alone … puts the Marshall Islands at a huge disadvantage given its nuclear and environmental-related activism." Doulatram quotes the first Marshallese President Amata Kabua who said: "When you grow up with your brother and he's a lot bigger than you and he slaps you … what can you do?" Hosting the US base and weapons tests is part of a compromise that the Marshall Islands have accepted for better or worse. Currently, the US pays just over $21 million annually to local land owners for the lease of Kwajalein Atoll that runs through 2066 (with the option to extend until 2086). Known as a large ocean state, the Republic of the Marshall Islands has just 181 square kilometres of land but nearly two million square kilometres of sea.

In July, Hawaii's Emergency Management Agency released a public message announcing preparations for the possibility of a nuclear attack. An ICBM launched from North Korea is believed to be able to reach Hawaii in just 20 minutes. The notion that small island nations have no choice but to stay dependent on the US military for economic survival is the same logic of an abuser telling a woman she has no choice but to stay in a violent relationship. Kim Compoc, University of Hawaii Kim Compoc, a lecturer with the Departments of English and Ethnic Studies at the University of Hawaii, says Hawaii's large military presence makes the islands more vulnerable and, because of their proximity to Asia , a more plausible target than the continental US. Compoc rejects the argument that Hawaii must rely on the military. "The notion that small island nations have no choice but to stay dependent on the US military for economic survival is the same logic of an abuser telling a woman she has no choice but to stay in a violent relationship," she says. In June, Compoc was part of a delegation from Hawaii which travelled to Okinawa for the ninth gathering of the International Women's Network Against Militarism to counter preparations for war and build solidarity. "It was very moving to speak about Hawaiian sovereignty there and have Okinawans hold their fists up in solidarity," Compoc says. Building this kind of solidarity across cultures, languages and national identities is at the heart of Kyle Kajihiro's work as a board member of Hawaii Peace and Justice . "The protection of our islands, whether Hawaii, Guam, or Okinawa, is not the primary purpose of US bases. The US uses our islands as military platforms and command centres to launch attacks and wage wars in other parts of the world," Kajihiro says. Kajihiro points out that prior to the 1893 US overthrow of what had been the independent Kingdom of Hawaii, its leaders had anticipated the danger of being drawn into a war if Hawaii was allied with a large military power. The creation of an alliance of Pacific Island states that those leaders sought lives on today in the desire for a pan-Pacific alliance as the threat of war looms large across the region. Recalling historical attacks and battles from Guam and Okinawa to Kwajalein and Pearl Harbor, Kajihiro says, "when the US militarises our islands ... we become targets."

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspects Galido outpost and Jangjedo defending force in this undated photo [KCNA/Reuters] The idea of assassinating a public figure or a high profile enemy, so as to remove a problem, has a dangerously simplistic logic to it. It is believed that once a leader is eliminated, his or her followers, and problems that they cause, will also dissolve. But h istory abounds with examples of political assassinations that went really wrong. Yet in the 21st century, the practice of assassination appears to be more popular than ever, with recent examples coming from North Korea with the deaths of Jang Song Thaek (uncle to Kim Jong-un) and Kim Jong-nam (the half-brother of the North Korean leader). More surprisingly, there have been rumours and discussions about the assassination of Kim Jong-un in the West. Many in the United States have started to wonder, and are possibly preparing (or even having tried, if North Korean accounts are to be believed) to "decapitate" the North Korean leadership. After all, why not utilise a practice that Kim Jong-un currently appears to use against his enemies and remove one man in order to potentially avert a nuclear war and save millions? But, as logical as it may seem to some warmongers, assassinating the North Korean leader is not a good idea. A man hard to kill The first reason why assassinating Kim Jong-un is not a good idea is that it would be a very difficult task to achieve and a failed attempt could have disastrous consequences. North Korea, at over 120,000 square kilometres, with mountains making up nearly 80 percent of its surface, is one of the most heavily fortified countries in the world. The country is also known for its tapestry of tunnels and between 6,000 to 8,000 subterranean facilities, all making it very easy for Kim to hide. In addition, intense secrecy, decoys, unpredictable schedules and what appears to be a very efficient security service, mean that the times that Kim Jong-un may appear in the cross-hairs are few and far between. If an attempt was made, and failed, the full nuclear anger of Kim Jong-un could be expected in response. The second reason why assassinating the North Korean strongman is not a good idea for the US is that although attempting to assassinate foreign leaders in times of war is permissible, in times of peace this practice is illegal under US laws. Although the US has started down a slippery slope with its targeted killings in the so-called "war on terror", President Gerald Ford's 1976 Executive Order , (which came on the back of CIA's failed attempts on Cuban leader Fidel Castro) stating, "no employee of the United States shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, political assassination" is still in place. Of course President Donald Trump can nullify this executive order and prepare the legal ground for an assassination, but for now, any attempt on the North Korean leader's life would be against US law. Not a guaranteed solution {articleGUID} The third reason why assassination is not a good idea is that Kim Jong-un's death by no means guarantees solving the problem. The best case scenario is that after the death of Kim Jong-un, power would be quickly grabbed by a safer pair of hands. This is the Boris Yeltsin scenario, in which a more reasonable figure emerges and saves the day, steering the world away from nuclear war after the ousting of a "problematic" leader. But in the case of modern-day North Korea, there is no evidence to support this optimistic ending. The more likely scenario is that, if Kim Jong-un is "eliminated", power would pass directly to one of his children in accordance with a pre-agreed succession plan. Either his sister, Kim Yo-jong , or his wife, Ri Sol-ju will act as regent until his elected heir is old enough to take control of the communist de-facto monarchy. Assuming there would not be a palace coup within the family, the success of this type of regency and succession would depend on support from the military. Of course, some military commanders may also try to topple the Kim dynasty and grab the leadership position for themselves. At the moment no one knows how any of these actors would act once they assume power or whether they would work towards bringing an end to North Korea's current confrontation with the US. An alternate possibility is the country descending into absolute chaos after such an assassination. Recent examples of the deaths of Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi show that the removal of such strongmen can bring dangerous fragmentation and enduring conflict that destabilise regions for decades ahead. The final and most likely possibility is that the "head of the snake" keeps biting for a few minutes after it is decapitated. In this situation an armed response would unfold automatically in accordance with protocols prepared in anticipation of such an event, and/or the North Korean military and citizens get so angry at the US for killing their beloved leader that they start firing everything they have. In this very likely scenario, the assassination would spark a completely undesired outcome and trigger a war on the Korean Peninsula. So, it is safe to say "cutting the head of the snake" is most definitely not a good idea in North Korea.

US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One for travel to Hawaii, on his way to an extended trip to five countries in Asia on November 3, 2017 [Reuters/Jonathan Ernst] Donald Trump is set to arrive in South Korea on November 7. The country is naturally abuzz with anticipation, in a show of how important the military alliance with the US is, especially at a time of tense standoff with North Korea . The foreign minister and the South Korean ambassador to Washington will reportedly be at the airport to greet Trump and his wife. South Korean President Moon Jae-in will then have a one-on-one with his US counterpart before an extravagant dinner party with K-pop performances and traditional music. Trump will also address the National Assembly and visit US military base, Camp Humphreys. All that brouhaha over Trump's visit belies the difficult predicament the South Korean government is in. Since taking office, Trump has made clear that he cares only about US interests. To continue kowtowing to Washington would be dangerous, even if Seoul cannot quite quit the pretence of honouring its longtime ally, at least not yet. The Trump presidency, less than a year old, has been a headache for President Moon, who won the elections in May promising greater engagement and an end to hostility between the two Koreas. He took power exactly as Trump engaged in a verbal escalation with Pyongyang, threatening "fire and fury" and unilateral military action against North Korea. It has become apparent that the US president doesn't particularly care about the safety and security of Korean people. According to Republican senator Lindsey Graham , Trump said, "If thousands die, they're going to die over there." During the visit, Trump is also bound to bring up, at least privately, the free-trade agreement (FTA) between South Korea and the US, having insisted that it is "horrible" and "job-killing" for Americans. At Washington's demand, the two sides agreed early October to renegotiate the deal. While Moon opposed the FTA when he was in opposition six years ago, he is hardly in a position to give it up now, considering that South Korean businesses benefit greatly from the arrangement. {articleGUID} Despite disagreements, Moon has tried to sound in sync with the US leadership. He has been adamant to show support for stronger measures against North Korea and has repeatedly invoked the word "pressure," which he says is necessary to bring North Korea back to the negotiation table. The government announced on Friday that it was about to release a list of its own sanctions against Pyongyang, at the request of the Americans. And Moon has tried to downplay the looming FTA renegotiation, saying in August that it is not "some immediate, major crisis". Like Moon, South Koreans are not really enamoured with Trump, though they do value relations with the US. Most South Koreans - 78 percent, to be precise - have no confidence in Trump, according to a Pew Research Center survey released in June, but a similar number - 75 percent - express favourable opinions toward the US even at a time when the US's likeability is declining around the world. In a separate poll , conducted last November by Asan Institute, a domestic think tank, the percentage of respondents who said that US-South Korean relations would worsen jumped more than four times from 2015 (14.1 percent) to 2016 (64 percent). From 2014 to 2016, the percentage of South Koreans who thought US military presence in South Korea to be the most important issue for the two allies nearly doubled from 17.6 to 30. In other words, more South Koreans than not view Trump's intentions toward the Korean Peninsula with scepticism, and there is growing attention to whether the US should continue to guarantee South Korea's security. An ostensibly liberal politician that rose to power as part of a movement to oust a corrupt conservative government, Moon is trapped between an uncaring ally and an electorate that is psychologically dependent on it, and he knows it. His discontent surfaces in the media only through more talkative members of his circle, like special advisor Moon Chung-in, who caused a firestorm late September by saying that e ven if the US-South Korea alliance falls apart, war must be stopped. It was actually a good point: Why should South Korea beg for American protection when the US doesn't seem committed to peace in the Korean Peninsula? {articleGUID} Knowing that there are fundamental differences between Moon and Trump, South Korean conservatives have sought to exploit the visit as an occasion to fan the public's anxiety and undermine the president's popularity. Opposition lawmakers and conservative media are hounding the presidential office over why Trump is spending only one night in South Korea when he is spending two nights in Japan and China. They insist that the government is slighting the US president or hasn't done enough to win Washington's favour. Competing rallies, for and against Trump's visit, took place this weekend, and it's obvious that Washington has left Seoul with no choice but to lessen its dependence on the US. That's why the administration rightly - but carefully - has begun working to improve relations with China . On October 30, Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa announced that there would be no additional deployment of THAAD, a US-made missile defence system which was set up to protect South Korea from North Korean missiles but which has angered Beijing to no end. She also said that South Korea is working on establishing its own defence system. This has brought almost immediate relief for South Korean businesses that have been suffering from a form of unofficial sanctions imposed by the Chinese government over the THAAD deployment last year. On November 3, Moon gave an interview to Singapore's Channel News Asia in which he defined his policy as "balanced diplomacy". But, no doubt, Moon will need to explain to Trump during next week's visit what this pivot means. And if Trump is smart, he will get the message: Show that you genuinely care for the people of this country, or we can find another ally.

The US has dismissed North Korea's accusation that President Donald Trump has declared war against the country, calling it 'absurd' [Reuters] In the coming days, there are three possible triggers for war with North Korea that need to be carefully watched. The first possible trigger is a declaration of war by North Korea, especially since the United States has made clear it has not declared war . The idea that countries would formally declare war against each other, before commencing hostilities, is a relic of the early 20th century. Although remnants of the practice remain, it was largely outdated by the second world war as the military advantages of surprise as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour and the Nazi attack on Soviet Russia, made clear. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5588700659001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5588700659001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: North Korea accuses US of declaring war (1:46) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY After the second world war, the United Nations hoped that all members would refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state , to which Declarations of War by individual states would become redundant. However, when the North Korean armed forces advanced over the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950, without a declaration of war, it was shown how in vain this hope was. The response to this act of aggression by North Korea was the 84th resolution ( pdf ) of the Security Council (when the Soviet Union was absent from the vote) to defend South Korea under the UN flag but with the leadership of the US. Today, the situation is even more complicated as the North Korean rhetoric of declaring war is not uncommon. Following the 2013 sanctions ( pdf ) approved by the Security Council against North Korea for their nuclear test , Kim Jong-un promised a pre-emptive strike against the US with nuclear weapons . This was followed by a " Full War Declaration Statement " . This was all part of their assertions that North Korea had scrapped the armistice that ended the first Korean War in 1953. To show their determination in 2013, North Korea also cut the hotline that enabled direct communication between North and South Korea. Although the hotline was reconnected a few months later, when South Korea closed down the joint Kaesong industrial complex following Kim Jung-un's fourth nuclear test in early 2016, North Korea condemned the act as a Declaration of War, and then cut the hotline again . READ MORE: North Korea tensions - All the latest updates Cutting the hotline is more dangerous than the rhetoric. Hotlines prevent accidental war. South Korea, which has a hotline to China , has been trying to have its hotline to North Korea reconnected. However, the line that is really needed is one between North Korea and Washington. Such best practice has been evident since 1963 , following the Cuban Missile Crisis, when the two superpowers recognised the necessity to be able to talk directly, at short notice, whenever required so as not to stumble into nuclear war. Possible detonation of a nuclear device The second possible trigger to watch for is the North Korea threat of a possible detonation of a nuclear device in the atmosphere over the Pacific. Although the aesthetics of such an act would shock the world as humanity has not seen a nuclear airburst since that done by China in 1980, this would not be the beginning of hostilities. Such an act would violate international environmental law, not the laws of war and peace. Kim will start a war if he detonates his device over or within someone else's territory, including the ocean spaces that they control, such as with the American land and ocean territory of Guam. Kim will start a war if he detonates his device over or within someone else's territory, including the ocean spaces that they control, such as with the American land and ocean territory of Guam. However, if he exploded it in international territory, such as the high seas, he faces different rules, such as when Australia and New Zealand took France to the International Court of Justice ( pdf ) after French atmospheric testing caused radiation pollution to fall on them, downwind. It was for this reason of pollution that most of the global community concluded an international agreement prohibiting such atmospheric nuclear testing. Although North Korea is not a signatory to this agreement, the same international rules ( pdf ) about not causing significant environmental damage to other nations still apply. Shooting down an aircraft The third possible trigger to watch for is the North Korea threat to shoot down aircraft in international airspace (as in, mirroring the territorial sea, 12 nautical miles/22.2km out from the land). Previously in 1969, North Korea did shoot down an American spy plane ( pdf ), killing all 31 members aboard when it was operating in international airspace. At that point, President Nixon did not respond with violence due to a fear of how the Soviet Union and China would react. Today, as the over 60 times that Russian military aircraft have flown close to Alaska or down past the edge of Western Europe in the past 10 years have shown, no matter how unpleasant such acts may be, such planes may be intercepted and followed, but they may not be shot down if they do not cross into territorial airspace. To ensure that no mistakes are made in this carefully choreographed sabre rattling, certain rules need to apply - primarily, the planes should not be invisible. Where possible, transponders and radios should be on, and (as the US appears to be doing ) flight plans disclosed in advance. If Kim decides to take down one of the American planes flying in international airspace, as his grandfather Kim Il-sung did in earlier times, he would be gambling against the odds that President Trump will not respond with violence.

The win makes Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Japan's longest-serving leader [Toru Hanai/Reuters] Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has secured a big victory in Sunday's election, boosting his push to reform the country's pacifist constitution amid tensions with North Korea . At a news conference on Monday, Abe said that he would pursue "strong diplomacy" to pressure Pyongyang to halt its nuclear weapons programme. He also referred to Japanese citizens who were kidnapped and believed to be held captive in North Korea. "I will pursue decisive and strong diplomacy to tackle North Korea's missile, nuclear and abduction issues and put further pressure to get it to change its policy," he said. Super Majority The ruling coalition won a supermajority of 312 seats in the 465-seat parliament in the snap elections, enough to push through Abe's agenda. Japan's constitution limits the military to being a self-defence force after its defeat in World War II. Abe says the law is a relic of the past and having a super majority will help him reform the pacifist constitution and allow Japan's armed forces to play a more active role. The victory marks a remarkable turnaround for the Japanese leader. Plagued by corruption scandals, Abe and his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) were on shaky ground just last month. Japan snap elections: All you need to know The win makes Abe Japan's longest-serving leader. He says the results indicate that voters support his policies and want to see his political leadership continue. Abe also pledged to take measures that would tackle Japan's demographic challenges, as the country continues to struggle with an ageing and shrinking population. Tokyo's Nikkei Index on Monday reacted positively to the victory of LDP leader, who is seen as a pro-business prime minister.

1956,US hydrogen bomb over Bikini Atoll [AP] Former US President Jimmy Carter said he would be willing to travel to North Korea on behalf of the Trump administration to help defuse rising tensions, The New York Times reported on its website on Sunday. "I would go, yes," Carter, 93, told the Times when he was asked in an interview at his ranch house in Plains, Georgia, whether it was time for another diplomatic mission and whether he would do so for President Trump. Carter, a Democrat who was president from 1977 to 1981, said he had spoken to Trump's National Security Adviser Lieutenant General HR McMaster, who is a friend, but so far has gotten a negative response. "I told him that I was available if they ever need me," the Times quoted Carter as saying. Told that some in Washington were made nervous by Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un 's war of words, Carter said: "I'm afraid, too, of a situation." "They want to save their regime. And we greatly overestimate China's influence on North Korea. Particularly to Kim," who, Carter added, has "never, so far as I know, been to China. And they have no relationship. Kim Jong-il did go to China and was very close to them." Carter worried that if Kim thinks Trump will act against him, he could do something pre-emptive, the Times reported. "I think he's now got advanced nuclear weaponry that can destroy the Korean Peninsula and Japan, and some of our outlying territories in the Pacific, maybe even our mainland," Carter said. In the mid-1990s, Carter travelled to Pyongyang over the objections of President Bill Clinton , the Times report said, and struck a deal with Kim Il-sung, grandfather of the current leader.

Mattis, right, and South Korean Defence Minister Song Young-moo inspect a guard of honour on Saturday [Lee Jin-man/AP] The United States will never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea and any nuclear attack by Pyongyang will meet a massive military response, the US defence chief warned. James Mattis made the comments in Seoul, South Korea , on Saturday at a joint press conference with his counterpart Song Young-moo, a day after visiting the demilitarised zone that has divided the two Koreas since the 1950-53 war on the peninsula. "Make no mistake - any attack on the United States or our allies will be defeated," Mattis said. "Any use of nuclear weapons will be met with a massive military response. "I can't imagine a condition under which the United States will accept North Korea as a nuclear power… Our combined effort is to deter that sort of threat or to have military options - many different military options - that would realistically reduce that threat as low as possible. And yes, we do have those options," the defence secretary said. The North's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper accused the US and South Korea on Saturday of "crazily beating the drum of confrontation". Using the acronym for the country's official name, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, it added "no force can ever check the strenuous advance of the DPRK … demonstrating its dignity as a nuclear power." In a commentary on Friday, the official Korean Central News Agency warned the US, South Korea, and Japan against "militarist ambition". {articleGUID} The US "eggs its junior allies on to come out as cannon fodder", it said, adding the three countries "must clearly understand that retaliation of justice will ensue the reckless military action". Tensions on the divided peninsula have heightened in recent months after a flurry of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests and the North's sixth and most powerful nuclear detonation last month. The US fears Pyongyang's nuclear capabilities will soon reach the point where it can fire a nuclear-tipped ICBM that is able to hit the US mainland. President Donald Trump has warned the US will "totally destroy" the communist country if it attacks the US or its allies in the Asia-Pacific region. For its part, North Korea has condemned repeated US-South Korean military exercises off the peninsula, which it says are a prelude to a military strike aimed at decapitating regime of leader Kim Jong-un . Al Jazeera's Tony Birtley, reporting from Seoul, said despite Mattis' strong language on Saturday, the Pentagon chief did stress diplomacy was the preferred way forward. "He is working in a highly tense situation now. The ante has been upped considerably in the last few weeks," said Birtley. "With President Trump visiting on November 7-8, some people believe that will be a catalyst from some kind of response. The foreign minister of North Korea has intimated there could be an atmospheric nuclear test - maybe that could happen during President Trump's visit."

The war of words between Trump and Kim Jong-un has escalated recently [File photo/Reuters] North Korea's deputy UN ambassador has warned the situation on the Korean Peninsula "has reached the touch-and-go point and a nuclear war may break out any moment". Kim In-ryong told the UN General Assembly's disarmament committee on Monday that North Korea is the only country in the world that has been subjected to "such an extreme and direct nuclear threat" from the United States since the 1970s - and said the country has the right to possess nuclear weapons in self-defence. He pointed to large-scale military exercises every year using "nuclear assets" and said what is more dangerous is what he called a US plan to stage a "secret operation aimed at the removal of our supreme leadership". This year, Kim said, North Korea completed its "state nuclear force and thus became the full-fledged nuclear power which possesses the delivery means of various ranges, including the atomic bomb, H-bomb and intercontinental ballistic rockets". "The entire US mainland is within our firing range and if the US dares to invade our sacred territory even an inch, it will not escape our severe punishment in any part of the globe," he warned. READ MORE: Trump on North Korea: 'Only one thing will work' Kim's speech follows escalating threats between North Korea and the United States, and increasingly tough UN sanctions. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the North Korean crisis "will continue until the first bomb drops". Kim told the UN's disarmament committee the Democratic People's Republic of Korea - North Korea's official name - hoped for a nuclear-free world, but reiterated the country would never surrender its nuclear capabilities. "Unless the hostile policy and the nuclear threat of the US is thoroughly eradicated, we will never put our nuclear weapons and ballistic rockets on the negotiating table under any circumstances," Kim said. The US is not ruling out the eventual possibility of direct talks with North Korea, Deputy Secretary of State John J Sullivan said on Tuesday after Kim made his comments. "Eventually, we don't rule out the possibility of course of direct talks," Sullivan said in Tokyo after talks with his Japanese counterpart. "Our focus is on diplomacy to solve this problem that is presented by the DPRK. We must, however, with our allies, Japan and South Korea and elsewhere, be prepared for the worst should diplomacy fail."

The USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier is currently operating off the Korean Peninsula [File: Vincent Yu/AP] North Korea's official news agency described a US aircraft carrier patrolling off the Korean Peninsula as a "primary target" and said Washington should expect an "unimaginable" attack. The latest threat on Thursday came amid massive joint US-South Korean naval exercises off the peninsula involving the American aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan. North Korea condemned Seoul and Washington's move to mobilise nuclear strategic assets near the volatile peninsula. Pyongyang has slammed the warship manoeuvres as a "rehearsal for war". "The US is running amok by introducing under our nose the targets we have set as primary ones. The US should expect that it would face [an] unimaginable strike at an unimaginable time," said a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency. Tensions have skyrocketed because of North Korea's recent nuclear and missile tests and exchanges of heated rhetoric between US President Donald Trump and North Korea's leadership. The USS Ronald Reagan, a 100,000-tonne nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, patrolled in waters east of the Korean Peninsula on Thursday in a show of sea and air power. {articleGUID} The US Navy's biggest warship in Asia , with a crew of 5,000 sailors, launched almost 90 F-18 Super Hornet sorties from its deck, in sight of South Korean islands. It is conducting drills with the South Korean navy involving 40 warships deployed in a line stretching from the Yellow Sea west of the peninsula into the East Sea. "The dangerous and aggressive behaviour by North Korea concerns everybody in the world," Rear Admiral Marc Dalton, commander of the USS Reagan's strike group, said as warplanes taxied on the flight deck above. "We have made it clear with this exercise, and many others, that we are ready to defend the Republic of Korea." North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has vowed to take the "highest-level" measures against the United States and Trump threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea if the US is forced to defend itself and its allies from a missile attack. North Korea fired two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July and conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test last month. The US military manoeuvres come ahead to Trump's visit to Japan and South Korea starting on November 5.

An image of Kim Yo-jong shown on a TV screen in Seoul, South Korea [File: The Associated Press] North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has promoted his younger sister to a senior post in the one-party state, according to state media. Kim Yo-jong became an alternate member of the party's powerful Politburo, the decision-making body presided over by her brother, the official KCNA news agency said on Sunday. READ MORE: Meet the Kims - Who's who in North Korea's first family The promotion was announced along with those for dozens of other top officials at a meeting of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea on Saturday in the capital, Pyongyang. The Central Committee is one of the leadership committees of the party, consisting of the politburo - the highest executive organ - as well as the secretariat. Who is Kim Yo-jong? Kim Yo-jong , according to South Korean media , is 30 years old. Since inheriting power from his father in 2011, Kim has placed his younger sister in various positions in order to strengthen the position of the family within the country's leadership. She has frequently been seen accompanying her brother on his "field guidance trips" and other events and is known to have been involved in the party's propaganda operations. Both were born to the late former ruler Kim Jong-il and his third partner, former dancer Ko Yong-hui. The family has ruled North Korea since its creation in 1948. WATCH: Reality Check - What do we know about North Korea? Writing for Al Jazeera in February, Michael Madden, a visiting scholar at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, described Kim Yo-jong as one of the North Korean leaders "closest aides". Like her older half-sister, Sul-song, Yo-jong was a favourite child and expressed an early interest in North Korean politics," wrote Madden, who is also predicted that "Yo-jong will be a power player" in North Korean "for a long time to come as her career is just getting started". Her new position indicates she has become a replacement for Kim Jong-un's aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, who had been a key decision-maker when former leader Kim Jong-il was alive. In January, the US Treasury blacklisted Kim Yo-jong along with other North Korean officials over "severe human rights abuses". Since coming to power, Kim has overseen four of the country's six nuclear tests - most recently in September - while cementing his grip on power through a series of purges. An uncle, Jang Song-thaek, was executed in 2013 for treason and a half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, was killed by a toxic nerve agent in a Cold War-style assassination at an airport in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia , in February. Kim Jong-un and his sister Kim Yo-jong attend an opening ceremony of a newly-constructed residential complex in Pyongyang, on April 13, 2017 [File: Damir Sagolj/Reuters] Foreign minister promoted Kim Jong-sik and Ri Pyong-chol, two of the three men behind Kim's banned rocket programme, were also promoted. State media also announced that several other high-ranking cadres were promoted to the Central Committee, in what the South Korean unification ministry said could be an attempt by North Korea to navigate a way through its increasing isolation. "The large-scale personnel reshuffle reflects that Kim Jong-un is taking the current situation seriously, and that he's looking for a breakthrough by promoting a new generation of politicians," the ministry said in a statement. North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho, who named US leader Donald Trump "President Evil" in a bombastic speech to the UN General Assembly last month, was promoted to full vote-carrying member of the politburo. "Ri can now be safely identified as one of North Korea's top policymakers," Madden told Reuters news agency.

'Treasured sword' The announcements came as Pyongyang faces growing global pressure to curb its weapons drive following recent nuclear and missile tests. Tensions soared as Kim traded verbal threats with Trump, who tweeted on Saturday that " only one thing will work " to tame the isolated nuclear-armed state. During Saturday's party meeting, Kim acknowledged the country faced with "ordeals" under a "stern" situation, but claimed that its economy had grown this year despite ever-tighter sanctions. He described the North Korea's atomic weapons as a "treasured sword" to protect it from aggression. "The nuclear weapons of the DPRK (North Korea) are a precious fruition borne by its people's bloody struggle for defending the destiny and sovereignty of the country from the protracted nuclear threats of the US imperialists," Kim was quoted as saying.

James Mattis, centre, and South Korean Defence Minister Song Young-moo look into North Korea from the DMZ on Friday [Jung Yeon-je via AP] The United States does not want war with North Korea , the US military chief said on the demilitarised zone metres away from the communist state, as he warned Pyongyang to stop threatening "catastrophe" with its nuclear weapons. James Mattis made the brief comments standing next to South Korean Defence Minister Song Young-moo on Friday, describing Kim Jong-un's leadership as an "oppressive regime" that mistreats its people while its neighbour to the south offers a vibrant democracy. "Our goal is not war but rather the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula," Mattis was quoted as saying by South Korea's Yonhap news agency at Panmunjom village. The United States has about 30,000 American troops stationed in South Korea, a remnant of the 1950-1953 war on the peninsula that has never officially ended, with only an armistice agreement signed. Song said North Korea can never use its nuclear weapons. "If it does, it will face retaliation by the strong combined force of South Korea and the US," he warned. North Korea must to return to dialogue between the two Koreas, Song added. The threat of nuclear war has escalated in recent months as President Donald Trump has intensified his rhetoric against Kim's regime, including saying he would "totally destroy" North Korea if it threatened the US or its allies. Pyongyang responded by threatening to detonate a nuclear weapon in the atmosphere after its sixth and most powerful underground nuclear test last month.

Trump accused previous US administrations for not taking on North Korea [Yuri Gripas/Reuters] US President Donald Trump said that diplomatic efforts with North Korea have consistently failed, adding that "only one thing will work", without elaborating further. Trump has engaged in an escalating war of words with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un , trading insults amid rising tensions between the two countries rivals. "Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years, agreements made and massive amounts of money paid," Trump tweeted. It "hasn't worked, agreements violated before the ink was dry, makings fools of US negotiators. Sorry, but only one thing will work!"

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2017 Trump returned to the theme when he appeared on former governor Mike Huckabee's show on Trinity Broadcasting Network television on Saturday, blaming previous administrations for not having adequately addressed the issue before. This "should have been handled 25 years ago, it should have been handled 10 years ago, it should have been handled during the Obama administration," the president said, referring to his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama . The US has not ruled out the use of force to compel Pyongyang to halt missile and nuclear tests , and Trump has threatened to destroy the country. READ MORE: Trump threatens to 'destroy North Korea' if necessary The president also told journalists at a recent gathering with military leaders to discuss Iran , North Korea and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) group that the current period "could be the calm before the storm," declining to clarify his remarks. In recent days, as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson flew home from meeting with top Chinese officials, Trump tweeted that his envoy was "wasting his time" in trying to probe North Korea's willingness to talk. Insults and threats The message came after Tillerson had revealed there were backchannels between US and North Korean officials. James Mattis, the US d efence secretary, later expressed support for the diplomatic track in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, left, toasts with Donald Trump at a luncheon in New York City in September [Kevin Lamarque/Reuters] Tokyo, Japan - As US President Donald Trump arrives in Tokyo on Sunday, he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are expected to act in lockstep in terms of their messaging on North Korea - nuclear weapons and missile development are entirely unacceptable and "all options are on the table" in terms of how this threat may be met. The political phrase "all options on the table", of course, encompasses the possibility that the United States and Japan might jointly launch an aggressive military attack on North Korea, which they would portray as being "pre-emptive" in light of the many verbal threats that have already been issued by the regime of Kim Jong-un . At a personal level, Abe hardly needs Washington to push him into a hardline stance vis-a-vis North Korea (or China or even South Korea for that matter) because his hawkishness towards mainland Asian neighbours has been part of his political trademark throughout his career. At times, he has associated with even some of the more fringe elements of the Japanese hard right. As critics point out, support for " all options " including an attack on North Korea puts Abe in spiritual rebellion to the nation's constitution, which mandates that "the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes". Obviously, "all options are on the table" is precisely the sort of threat of the use of force that Japan's post-World War II constitution explicitly bans. Rewriting the 'Peace Constitution' {articleGUID} But Abe's antagonism towards his nation's " Peace Constitution " is hardly a new development. In recent years, he decapitated the independent bureaucratic agency that had traditionally guaranteed legislation's conformity to the national charter. In the summer of 2015, he went on to force passage of new security policy legislation that some 97 percent of independent legal scholars judged to be unconstitutional. Even expert witnesses handpicked by the ruling party itself shocked the Abe government by denouncing the unconstitutionality of the bills, which were, thereafter, enacted nonetheless. Finally, on May 3 of this year - the 70th anniversary of the Constitution - Abe announced his intention to revise the pacifist Article Nine in a video message to a meeting of the Nippon Kaigi (Japan Conference). The venue was significant. Nippon Kaigi is a controversial nationalist organisation seeking not only constitutional change, but also possessing a sweeping right-wing programme of Emperor-centrism, historical revisionism, opposition to female and LGBT equality, and a rollback of the entire Western conception of "rights" in favour of enhanced individual "obligations" to the state. While Abe has proven to be slow and methodical since returning to power in December 2012, there is not much doubt that groups such as Nippon Kaigi remain his fundamental political base. Fresh off his third major general election victory on October 22, which was pulled off mainly via the dramatic implosion of the opposition challenge led by Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, Prime Minister Abe is now in a position to move forward his lifelong goal of revising the Constitution.

First, he must get his own fractious Liberal Democratic Party and coalition partner Komeito to reach consensus on a specific word-for-word proposal for rewriting the national charter. That task alone may prove his undoing. But even if he succeeds on that difficult matter, he still must conduct an unprecedented national referendum in which a majority of voters approve the proposed constitutional change. The latest poll by Kyodo News finds 52.6 percent of the Japanese public are opposed to Abe's current proposal with only 38.3 percent in support of it. When one also considers the fact the opposition parties will fight a ferocious campaign against revision - as well as the reality that polling shows deep public distrust towards the prime minister personally - the smart money still suggests that Abe will ultimately fail to achieve his dream. However, Japanese politics are likely to be tied up by these fierce battles over the "Peace Constitution" for the next several years. Abe is expected to push forward this issue, even at the cost of his own political life, because he is on the record as a lifelong true believer. The North's abductions {articleGUID} One related matter likely to be highlighted during Trump's visit is that of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea between 1977-1983 - another Abe pet issue by which he initially rode to national prominence from 2001-2006. North Korea admitted in 2002 to kidnapping Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 80s to help train its spies in Japanese language and culture. North Korea has insisted it resolved this issue in 2004 when five surviving abductees and their families (10 people in total) returned from North Korea. Japan has insisted, on the contrary, that Pyongyang has yet to reveal the full truth and that other abductees may still be alive. Trump is expected to echo the Japanese line on this issue as a demonstration of his political solidarity with Abe. The broader trajectory of the North Korea crisis remains a question mark. Abe has repeatedly denounced "talks for the sake of talks" and called for tougher sanctions on Pyongyang. There has been no indication, however, that he has any realistic diplomatic objective in mind beyond these serial calls for punishment. Brad Glosserman, senior adviser to Pacific Forum CSIS, echoes many analysts when he observes, "Kim Jong-un will not give his nukes, period … Kim Jong-un sees them first as instrumental to his regime survival." He adds, "Without nuclear weapons North Korea is nothing." There are no serious analysts who believe that economic pressure will induce Pyongyang to disarm itself, even though that is what both the Trump and Abe administrations publicly claim is the objective of their current sanctions policy. The major wild card without a doubt is Trump. While all other players can be expected to behave in a manner in which they have long been behaving, the unpredictable US president is certainly the most dangerous element of instability. According to Koichi Nakano, professor at Sophia University, "for the first time in many years, the Japanese people are not sure whether the United States, and its president in particular, is a force for good - whether it really provides for the safety of the country and the region". None of these doubts, however, are expected to be reflected in the shows of mutual friendship and solidarity that Shinzo Abe and Donald Trump will perform for the cameras.

Two US Air Force B1-B Lancer bombers and fighter jets conducted an exercise over South Korea on Thursday [File: Christopher Quail/US Air Force via AP] North Korea has accused the United States of conducting a surprise "nuclear bomb dropping drill" on major targets in the communist country a day after two American B-1B warplanes flew over South Korean airspace. "The reality clearly shows that the gangster-like US imperialists are the very one who is aggravating the situation of the Korean Peninsula and seeking to ignite a nuclear war," the official Korean Central News Agency said on Friday. The report also highlighted that three US aircraft carrier strike groups are converging off the peninsula in advance of US President Donald Trump's visit to the region starting on Sunday. Trump's talks in Japan , South Korea, and China will focus heavily on the alleged threat posed by North Korea, which continues to progressively expand its nuclear and missile programmes. "The US imperialists are making last-ditch efforts to check the dynamic advance of the DPRK by deploying their nuclear strategic assets in succession, but its army and people are never frightened at such moves. The US imperialist warmongers should not act rashly," KCNA warned , using the acronym for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier is one of three strike groups heading towards the Korean Peninsula [File: Ha Kyung-min/Newsis via AP] North Korea needs nuclear weapons as a deterrent to prevent "invasion and plunder" by the United States , Pyongyang's official media says. The online commentary on Wednesday by the Uriminzokkiri website, part of the Korean Central News Agency, also condemned the US and its allies' "crazy escalation of sanctions, pressure, and military threats" against the communist country that "will get them nowhere". "The nuclear force of the DPRK has become a strong deterrent for firmly protecting peace and security of the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia and creditably guaranteeing the sovereignty and the rights to existence and development of the Korean nation," it said , using the acronym for the country's official name, Democratic People's Republic of Korea. North Korea is developing its nuclear weapons so it doesn't endure "the tragic situation of the war-torn non-nuclear countries which became the targets of invasion and plunder by the US", it added. The comments come before US President Donald Trump 's two-week visit to the Asia-Pacific region starting on Friday, where the threat of a military confrontation with North Korea will be high on the agenda in Japan, South Korea , and China. {articleGUID} Tensions remain sky high after North Korea's sixth and most powerful underground nuclear test in September, and a flurry of ballistic missile tests in recent months. The US has said it will never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea and Trump has threatened to " totally destroy " the country. In response, Kim Jong-un 's leadership said it may conduct an atmospheric nuclear weapons test. In advance of Trump's visit, three American aircraft carrier strike groups have been deployed to the region, a move military analysts have described as unusual. Stratfor, a US-based intelligence analysis company, noted in a report on Tuesday that the US Air Force also will send a dozen F-35A stealth fighter jets to a base in Japan in early November. "The gathering is a rare occurrence - the last time three US aircraft carrier strike groups convened for a combined exercise was in 2007 - and will give the United States a powerful force within striking distance of North Korea," Stratfor said. "Taken together, these developments suggest that the United States is preparing for a confrontation. But that doesn't necessarily mean that Washington is gearing up to start a war with Pyongyang," the report concluded . Michael T Clare, a professor of peace and world-security studies at Hampshire College in the US, wrote on Wednesday in The Nation : "There can be only two plausible explanations for this extraordinary naval buildup: to provide Trump with the sort of military extravaganza he seems to enjoy; and/or to prepare for a pre-emptive military strike on North Korea." {articleGUID} The Uriminzokkiri commentary denounced the military build-up near North Korea.

Trump has so far balked at entering into a dialogue with Kim Jong-un's regime over its nuclear programme [Reuters] Washington, DC - US President Donald Trump will seek to raise international economic and political pressure on North Korea as he visits Japan, South Korea , and China, amid nuclear tensions and rising calls for serious negotiations that the president so far has rejected. Legislators and foreign policy analysts in the United States are watching closely to see whether Trump, on a 12-day trip to the Asia-Pacific region, continues his threatening rhetoric at Pyongyang or pivots towards diplomacy, as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense James Mattis have advocated. "We need to support our diplomatic team in every way that we can, because short of us, collectively with China and few other countries being able to change the dynamic, we are heading to a very bad place," Senator Bob Corker , Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Al Jazeera. Trump has escalated US military deployments in Northeast Asia, sending F-35s, the US' most advanced fighter jets, to Japan . He also followed through with the deployment of a THAAD anti-missile system in South Korea, over China's objections, and sent three aircraft carrier strike groups to the Pacific.

Behind the scenes, the president is said to have effectively shut down US diplomatic efforts to talk to the North Koreans through the United Nations, the so-called New York channel, worrying US legislators. "The minimalist talks that existed are breaking down. He's made it pretty clear he has no interest in keeping open a dialogue with North Korea," Senator Chris Murphy , a Connecticut Democrat and Trump critic, told Al Jazeera. "No one has been authorised to negotiate by this administration. They need to start over with a strategy that gradually builds up political, economic, and military pressure - ultimately leading to negotiations they have been unable thus far to put together." Pyongyang has responded to Trump with threats to test a powerful hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean, and issued statements suggesting the president needs medication, calling Trump an "aged retard", famously translated in the US from Korean to English as "dotard". The back and forth has raised alarm worldwide and underlined both Kim and Trump's unpredictability - and relative inexperience on the world stage. South Korea President Moon Jae-in , who has sought detente with the north, has called on the US not to take any military action without South Korea's agreement. Trump has personally disparaged Moon and opened up the question of the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement, which has strategic implications. "The president wants to be in a position that the message that Kim Jong-un receives is that there is a solid front, with no cracks in the mutual security agreement of Korea with the United States," said Don Manzullo , president of the Korea Economic Institute of the US, which supports US-Korea trade. "Un has to realise that the world is united against him." {articleGUID} Trump will travel first to Japan on Sunday where he will meet with newly re-elected Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has taken a hawkish line on North Korea, advocating at the UN for tougher sanctions and at home for a more robust Japanese military posture. Trump and Abe will hold a bilateral summit and a press conference. "Abe seems to be a bit more of a hawk than South Korea. But ultimately, if the United States supports diplomacy, then everybody in the region supports it too because nobody wants a war," said Tom Z. Collina , director of policy for the Ploughshares Fund, a non-profit group that advocates the elimination of nuclear weapons. "This trip is an opportunity for Trump himself to pivot towards diplomacy as the main way to solve the North Korea crisis, but he may not take it," Collina told Al Jazeera. In advance of the president's trip, the White House announced moves designed to increase pressure on both North Korea and China. Chinese solution? Officials said Trump will use his meeting with China President Xi Jinping to take tougher measures against North Korea. The Treasury Department announced on Thursday it was cutting off the small Chinese Bank of Dandong from an international transaction network, alleging the bank had helped finance North Korea's missiles. "China is part of the solution to any coherent North Korea strategy, but the strategy needs to start with alliances, and the most concerning thing is the state of the US-South Korea alliance," said Brian Harding , director for Asia-Pacific security policy at the Center for American Progress and a former Defense Department adviser in the Obama administration. Back home in Washington, the US Congress is advancing additional financial sanctions while signaling legislators are prepared to rein in Trump's ability to launch a military attack. The key objective, they say, is getting North Korea to negotiate. {articleGUID} "It's important that we reassure our allies, South Korea and Japan, that we stand with them, that we are solid," Senator Chris Van Hollen , a Maryland Democrat and sponsor of a new bank sanctions bill, told Al Jazeera. "We will not accept a North Korea with nuclear weapons and we need to keep pushing. We have got to exert more pressure on North Korea." But sanctions and military pressure are unlikely to yield results without presidential leadership from Trump on negotiations, experts say. "You don't know what the North Koreans are up to unless you negotiate and talks are not the same thing as negotiations," said Leon V Sigal , director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project at the Social Science Resource Council in New York and author of the 1998 book, Disarming Strangers: Nuclear Diplomacy with North Korea. "The US needs to put a proposal on the table to address their security needs in return for a suspension of the nuclear programmes. That's the best you can do right now," Sigal said.

The two sides reached only a partial agreement in Cairo, addressing civil and administrative matters [Reuters] Nazareth - The announcement of an Egypt-brokered reconciliation agreement between Fatah and Hamas on Thursday raised hopes that a decade of bitter feuding between the rival Palestinian factions may finally come to an end. The early conclusion of the talks in Cairo hinted at how much pressure both sides were under to make progress. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas hailed what he called a "declaration of the end to division". He is expected to visit Gaza within the next month, for the first time since Hamas removed Fatah from the enclave in 2007. However, the two sides reached only a partial agreement, addressing civil and administrative matters. Far more contentious issues - such as national elections, reform of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the status of Hamas' armed wing - were set aside for consideration at the next meeting in late November. Ghassan Khatib, a former Palestinian Authority (PA) minister, said that after previous failed reconciliation efforts, the chances of success had been improved because both factions had accepted "a step-by-step approach". Most importantly, agreement was reached on allowing security forces under Abbas' control to oversee the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt . That should encourage Egypt to end its closure of the crossing, allowing goods and people to pass through and alleviating the enclave's humanitarian crisis. {articleGUID} Gaza's police force will be rebuilt to include 3,000 PA officers, and Hamas officials in Gaza are to be integrated into PA ministries. The sanctions imposed by Abbas since the spring to tightly limit the entry of fuel, cutting Gaza's electricity supplies to a few hours a day, will end. "The price of this kind of reconciliation-lite is affordable, even for Israel," Khatib told Al Jazeera. "As long as reconciliation deals only with humanitarian and environmental problems, and with the provision of services and the salaries of employees, it can succeed. "But the moment it addresses major security and political matters, it will fail." Egypt's role has proved crucial. Mouin Rabbani, a Palestinian analyst based in Jordan , said Cairo had exploited the humanitarian crisis in Gaza as leverage to resolve its own security concerns in Sinai. "Egypt wanted to prevent ISIS from enjoying the benefits of a safe haven in Gaza," he told Al Jazeera. In addition, Cairo feared that, if the crisis continued, it might lead to another round of fighting between Israel and Hamas, leaving Palestinians clamouring for entry into Sinai to escape the devastation. That risked shining a spotlight on Egyptian complicity with Israel in sustaining the siege of Gaza through its closure of the Rafah border crossing. National elections The US administration is reported to be eager to see the talks succeed too, as a way to sideline Hamas and improve the chances for President Donald Trump to sell his long-promised "ultimate" deal for peace. That is the one straw that Abbas, pursuing his diplomatic campaign for statehood, can still clutch at. "Reconciliation is something everyone wants now," Khatib said. "Abbas wants to extend his jurisdiction to Gaza. Hamas wants to be rid of the burden of the day-to-day governance of Gaza. The international donors want to be able to direct money into Gaza again. "Even Israel has an interest in a solution to Gaza's humanitarian problems. After all, Gaza's untreated sewage ends up on Israeli beaches, too." But the wider issues of reconciliation are likely to prove harder to resolve. Hundreds of PA officials from the occupied West Bank arrived in Gaza last week to start setting up a national consensus government. This administration of technocrats is intended as a temporary measure until Palestinian elections can be arranged and a representative government installed. The issue of elections is expected to be dealt with in the next round of talks. But it is hard to see how national elections can be conducted. It was Hamas' upset election victory 11 years ago that led to a civil war with Fatah that cemented Gaza's effective political and territorial separation from the West Bank . Polls indicate that Abbas or any of his likely successors would lose the presidential election to Hamas leader Ismail Haniya. In addition, Fatah would suffer in Gaza, where its vote would be weakened by support for Mohammed Dahlan , Abbas' rival who has been exiled to the United Arab Emirates . With the help of Egypt, Dahlan has been pumping Gulf money into Gaza to build his support base and challenge Abbas. Abbas' best hope may be that Hamas seeks to avoid the responsibility of running Gaza again and agrees not to contest the presidential election. Or, more likely, said Khatib, long-overdue elections will be deferred, and the current government of unelected technocrats allowed to continue in office. 'Reconciliation is doomed' Equally divisive is the question of whether or how to integrate Hamas into the institutions of the PLO. Hamas has in the past insisted that in return for sharing the governance of Gaza with Fatah, it expects to have a stake in a reformed PLO. {articleGUID} But including Hamas would be certain to undermine Abbas' diplomatic strategy of seeking Palestinian statehood, Khatib said. Israel and the international community would be likely to withdraw their recognition of the PLO as the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people". "The danger is that each side knows reconciliation is doomed and is waiting this out in the hope that developments will provide them with an opportunity to blame the other side for the inevitable failure," Rabbani said. Another major hurdle is finding an arrangement for Hamas' 25,000-strong security forces in Gaza. Abbas has said he expects Hamas' military wing to be subordinate to the PA security services in Ramallah. In an interview with Egyptian TV last week, he called for "one state, one regime, one law and one weapon". Further, the Trump administration may insist on this provision. A statement last week from Jason Greenblatt, the White House's envoy to the region, said the unity government would have to "explicitly commit to nonviolence". However, disarmament or limitations on Hamas' military wing would almost certainly be a deal-breaker, especially given the PA's long-standing "security coordination" with Israel. Hamas has spent years building a sophisticated network of tunnels under Gaza that it believes were the key to its success in withstanding the onslaught from Israel in the 2014 war. It is difficult to imagine it giving up either the tunnels or its weapons. Hamas' popularity also depends on its commitment, sanctioned by international law, to armed resistance. To concede control over its military wing would be to strip the movement of its very raison d'etre. Nonetheless, there may be a path out of this apparent deadlock. Egypt's role In response to Abbas' statements, Haniya told Egyptian TV that, while the movement would never cede what he called "weapons of the resistance", it would agree to joint decisions with Fatah about when and how they would be used. Egypt is reported to have proposed the creation of a joint security council in Gaza. Its representatives would be split evenly between Hamas and Fatah, and consensus needed to sanction armed actions. Crucially, Egypt would have oversight of the council, effectively giving it a casting vote if the two Palestinian factions could not agree. A former Palestinian government minister, who wished not to be named, told Al Jazeera he expected Egyptian intelligence officials to directly supervise Gaza's security forces. That would allow Cairo to monitor more closely connections between Salafist groups in Gaza and those in Sinai, which have been waging an insurrection against the Egyptian army. But it is not clear whether Abbas will agree to relinquish his powers as supreme commander of the Palestinian security forces. {articleGUID} Rabbani warned against ignoring "the elephant in the room": Israel. Palestinian and Egyptian sources reported that an Israeli delegation touched down in Cairo for a few hours on Tuesday, as the talks between Hamas and Fatah began. If those reports are right, it confirms how vital Egypt considers Israel's cooperation to be if reconciliation is to hold. The last unity government, established in summer 2014, was short-lived. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced it from the outset as a "vote for terror". Weeks later, after three Jewish youths were kidnapped and killed in the occupied West Bank, Israel stepped up attacks on Gaza, culminating in a war that killed more than 1,500 civilians in the enclave. The fighting sounded the death knell for the unity government. Rabbani said Israel might try to engineer another confrontation to sabotage the reconciliation process. "Statements from [Defence Minister Avigdor] Lieberman are that Israel is preparing for another war with [the Lebanese faction] Hezbollah," said Rabbani. "But he has said that such a war can't be contained to the northern border - it will include Hamas too." Gershon Baskin, a director of the Israel-Palestine Centre for Research and Information and one of the few Israelis to have regular contact with the Hamas leadership, said Netanyahu would be on the lookout for opportunities to damage the unity government. "For sure, he is keen to create disruptions," he told Al Jazeera. "He prefers that the West Bank and Gaza stay divided so that there is no pressure on him to negotiate. He can then say Abbas does not represent all Palestinians or have control over all Palestinian territory." Subversion by stealth But Baskin also believes Netanyahu will be reluctant to make his opposition to the deal too explicit. He noted that the Israeli army is also warning that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza risks triggering a new round of fighting with Hamas that would be better avoided. Netanyahu will also not want to be seen to be openly defying the White House when Trump has publicly stated that he wants a regional peace framework in which Egypt is likely to play a key role. Trump, it was recently reported, told Antonio Guterres , the UN secretary-general, at a meeting last month that he considered Netanyahu the bigger obstacle to a peace deal. And Netanyahu is likely to be wary of sabotaging too directly the handiwork of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi when the Egyptian president clearly regards Palestinian reconciliation as a pressing security interest for Egypt. But Netanyahu will do his best to subvert the unity government by stealth, said Baskin. Even before the reconciliation agreement was announced, Netanyahu had called on the unity government to disband Hamas' military wing and for Hamas to cut its ties to Iran - conditions designed to strain Hamas-Fatah ties. This week, in a reminder of how quickly a confrontation could escalate, Israel attacked Gaza to punish Hamas after a Salafist group fired a rocket into Israel after the arrest by Hamas of several of its members.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has passed anti-democratic legislation, writes Levy [AP Photo/Ariel Schalit] The Israeli minister of communication, Ayoub Kara, made me feel ashamed. He made me feel ashamed as an Israeli, as a journalist, and as a liberal human being. Ayoub Kara wants to put Israel together with Saudi Arabia, Egypt , Bahrain and the Emirates, declaring war on Al Jazeera. Minister Kara is perceived in Israel as a political joke. He was nominated to his office just when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had to give it up for legal reasons. Kara became Netanyahu's puppet in the communication ministry. All this does not make his decision to declare war on Al Jazeera less important, or less meaningful. On the contrary, Minister Kara tries to follow not only his master's political attitudes, but also the Israeli national sentiment that any critical voices in Israel and from abroad should be fought.

It is not clear if the Israeli government can close Al Jazeera's bureau; if Al Jazeera employees can be prevented from working as journalists; if the governmental press office can revoke their accreditations; and if the government can prevent Israelis from watching Al Jazeera. But those are minor questions. The main issue is the Israeli intention and the Israeli policy, which has a much broader context. It is the democratic face of the state of Israel and the attempt to curb freedom of speech and freedom of the press in Israel - "the only democracy in the Middle East". This process might start with Al Jazeera but it will never stop there; it will continue with BBC and CNN and it might end with closing down Israeli media outlets the government doesn't favour. And therefore, the Al Jazeera case should worry many more Israelis, Jews and Arabs alike. What we see are the growing cracks in the Israeli democracy, nothing less than this. It is an extremely dangerous path, in which other governments in the world have walked, which you know where it begins but not where it ends. It is the dangerous path that, for example, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is walking. Israelis are taught to think that democracy is the rule of the majority; that the minorities have no rights; and that any criticism of Israel, from inside or outside, is nothing less than treason or anti-Semitism. The current government of Israel is the most nationalistic, right-wing government Israel has ever had. Mr Netanyahu has been in office for almost 10 years, but it is only in this current term that he and his colleagues have gained enough confidence to start to change the face of Israel and even its rule of law. His government has passed anti-democratic legislation against NGOs , launched a political attack on the legal system, incited against the media and the left, and declared war on any critic of Israel overseas. It is putting the legal and political infrastructure for creating an apartheid system in Israel, attacking anyone that might become an obstacle to achieve this goal. In this framework, Israel has recently started preventing human rights activists, critics of Israel and supporters of BDS from entering Israel and the Occupied Territories. In this context, the prime minister, who is under police investigation, suspected of bribery and other crimes, is trying to incite against the left and the media in Israel. This policy has many supporters in Israel. Israeli democracy is very fragile and is threatened by a lot of ignorance and anti-democratic perceptions. Israelis are taught to think that democracy is the rule of the majority; that the minorities have no rights; and that any criticism of Israel, from inside or outside, is nothing less than treason or anti-Semitism. A declaration to close down the office of a media outlet with the ultimate excuse that it is supporting terror and violating the security of Israel is perceived in Israel as a patriotic and popular step. The closing down of Al Jazeera is yet another attack on Israeli Palestinians, who are the main viewers of Al Jazeera in Israel and who have been the target of a systematic campaign, led by the government and the prime minister himself. The Israeli Palestinians are the fifth column and Al Jazeera is their flag. There are commentators who suggested that the move against Al Jazeera in Israel has to be seen in the context of the new so-called coalition of "moderate Sunni states" in the Middle East, led by Saudi Arabia , which Israel is trying to be part of. I do not agree with this explanation. From Tel Aviv, it looks like Kara's initiative has much more to do with the fight against the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement (BDS), against Haaretz, my newspaper, against the social-justice-oriented New Israel Fund and against the NGO Breaking the Silence (created by Israeli veterans) - rather than with the secret relations with Riyadh and Cairo. If the decision of Minister Kara will not be cancelled or declared illegal by the Supreme Court, it will be clear that Israel is taking an extremely dangerous path. The Israeli journalist association already protested against the intention to close Al Jazeera down. It is now up to all Israeli democrats to tell their government: do not dare to curb free access to any source of information, whether critical of Israel or not!

Palestinians celebrate after Hamas said it reached a deal with Palestinian rival Fatah, in Gaza City [Reuters] The Hamas-Fatah reconciliation announced October 12 in Cairo surprised many observers, who understandably expected another failure after a dozen or so unsuccessful efforts at reconciliation in the decade-long rift between the two main Palestinian factions. Many of the details of the latest Cairo deal have not emerged, there will be further talks November 21, and there is plenty of time for the agreement to encounter problems before its scheduled implementation. But from what is known now, the two sides seem more optimistic than in the past, based likely on Egypt's strong push for an agreement. Certainly, weary and disgruntled Palestinians would welcome reconciliation, seen as essential to strengthening their hand vis-a-vis Israel as well as returning a semblance of normal life to battered Gaza . Fatah representative Azzam al-Ahmad and Hamas' Salah al-Arouri said during their joint press conference that this was not a new deal, but rather a new commitment to implementing previous agreements (of which there have been several, for example in 2011 , 2014 , and as far back as 2005 . The agreement reached this week appears to focus on concrete issues relevant to the local population, as well as to Egypt and Israel - specifically who pays for what and who runs what in Gaza. The initial phase would include the reopening of the Rafah crossing to Egypt under the control of Palestinian Authority (PA) Presidential Guards on November 1, the resumption of PA governance in Gaza starting on December 1, and the reintegration of Hamas officials into the PA ministries in Gaza. A joint committee would be established to implement the third point. As part of the resumption of PA authority in Gaza, President Mahmoud Abbas would end the sanctions he imposed on Gaza in August and resume funding of essential governmental functions, such as electricity and employee salaries. Perhaps the most intriguing question is whether Israel and the United States will take a more positive attitude toward Fatah-Hamas reconciliation now than they have in the past What the new agreement does not seem to include is implementation of broader, more political aspects of previous reconciliation deals, such as incorporating Hamas into the Palestinian Liberation Organization (the body that negotiates with Israel, dominated by Fatah ), reconvening the elected Palestinian Legislative Council, or holding general elections. And there does not seem to be even lip-service paid to the idea of Hamas arms and fighters being incorporated into a broader force under PA control. Despite a recent avowal by Abbas that he would not accept a " Hezbollah model " - a political movement with a separate militia and limited involvement in governance - in Gaza, that is what seems to be emerging. {articleGUID} In fact, a peculiar combination of weakness and invincibility on the part of Hamas is one of the factors that made this mini-breakthrough possible. Ten years after Hamas took control of Gaza from the PA, the Strip teeters on the edge of a humanitarian crisis . Electricity has been limited to a few hours a day, the Rafah crossing point to Egypt remains closed, and economic conditions remain bleak. Without greater assistance from somewhere - the PA in Ramallah, the Gulf, or the international community - Gaza could face a genuine human disaster for which Hamas would bear responsibility. At the same time, various attempts to eliminate Hamas from the equation, or at least disarm it, by Israel, Egypt, and the PA have come to nought. Abbas, likewise a political survivor against the odds, appears by participating in this reconciliation to have outflanked his Fatah rival Mohammed Dahlan , who was the focus of another recent reconciliation attempt. The regional power struggle is also driving Palestinian reconciliation, with Egypt and the UAE having to stretch their policies (and for the UAE, pocketbook) in order to reduce Qatar's influence in Gaza . While on the surface Egypt appeared to be playing its typical reconciliation role, upon closer inspection that role was actually rather different from episodes in the recent past - and in fact, al-Ahmad and al-Arouri even remarked upon that in their press conference . After President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi came to power via a 2013 military coup, he initially abandoned the pretence at even-handedness his predecessors had adopted and instead took an explicitly partisan approach, treating Hamas as a terrorist organisation affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood and also siding with Dahlan against Abbas. But Sisi had to revert to a more typical Egyptian realpolitik position of dealing with those actually in power in Hamas and Fatah in order to make the new agreement possible. The Egyptian shift in position towards Hamas, no longer treated as a terrorist entity but rather a security partner , appears to be based on a calculation that Egypt needed Hamas cooperation in order to curtail the flow of arms and fighters to the insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula . Perhaps the most intriguing question is whether Israel and the United States will take a more positive attitude towards Fatah-Hamas reconciliation now than they have in the past. Prime Minister Netanyahu began to answer that question with a statement on Facebook late on October 12. Netanyahu insisted that Palestinian reconciliation must be based on the three Quartet conditions: any Palestinian government must renounce violence, recognise Israel, and accept the agreements negotiated between Israel and the PLO since 1993. But Netanyahu also went further , demanding that Hamas must disarm and denouncing reconciliation with "mass murderers." The initial US reaction has been low-key; shortly after the announced agreement on October 12, US State Department spokesman Heather Nauert welcomed the creation of "conditions for the Palestinian Authority to fully assume responsibilities in Gaza". In the lead-up to the talks, the US also couched its public statements in more positive tones, but it has nevertheless maintained its support for the Quartet conditions as it has since 2005. Whether Abbas can persuade the US government (and more to the point, Israel and the US Congress) that Hamas' participation in the PA does not violate those conditions is unclear.

A Palestinian woman bathes her son with water from a tank filled by a charity inside their dwelling in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on July 3, 2017 [Mohammed Salem/Reuters] The announcement in July of a water prices agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) has been hailed as a model of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation as well as a major achievement of the Trump administration's efforts to broker a comprehensive peace deal in the Middle East . Both the agreement and the process that yielded it, however, reveal a very different reality. The water prices agreement is part of a larger Red Sea-Dead Sea conveyance project by Israel, Jordan and the PA to build a conduit to move Red Sea water over mountains and down into the Dead Sea basin, with three outputs: the generation of increased hydroelectric power, more desalinated water for the parties, and an increase in water for the Dead Sea. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5503736274001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5503736274001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: UN report: Gaza is 'de-developing' even faster than expected (5:27) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY For more than a decade, this conduit project has been the subject of tense and difficult negotiations among the three parties. From a Palestinian perspective, this negotiation process has been one of continuous fighting to be treated equally and fairly with the other two states, despite the fact that the Israeli army maintains overall control of occupied Palestine . Even when the parties were agreed in principle on a project, Israel used its power to force Palestinians to accept less than what is fair. For example, the three parties agreed in December 2013 to a Memorandum of Understanding on Regional Water Sharing, involving a desalination plant to be built at Aqaba, Jordan , coupled with a water swap between Israel and Jordan, and a sale of water by Israel to the Palestinians. For three years, Israel insisted on a price for the water that the PA considered unreasonably high and unfair. After the recent intervention by the US envoy, the PA found the price "acceptable" even though it was higher than prices it pays for other water from Israel. The PA's acceptance is understandable only in the context of the intense pressure Palestinians face from ongoing water shortages and an inadequate infrastructure throughout its territories, a direct consequence of Israeli control. Decision-making since Oslo Israel has been able to use its occupying power to extract well over its fair share of water from the main aquifer that lies below the West Bank . Using mechanisms imposed by its army and established by the Oslo agreements, Israel severely limits Palestinian access to that aquifer, and to the surface water of the Jordan River. While the diplomatic process remains largely frozen between Israel and the Palestinians, by moving forward together to solve our water problems we can chart a course forward that will safeguard the vital resource of water for the future of both peoples. The 1995 Oslo Interim Agreement established a joint water committee (JWC) to review and approve all water projects in the West Bank, with the stated objective to enhance cooperation. Unfortunately, the reality is that Israeli water experts have used this JWC process to delay or disapprove Palestinian water projects until Palestinians agree to approve water projects favouring Israel's expanded (and illegal) settlement programme. The effect: a "quid pro quo" policy, with the Palestinian water system held hostage to Israel's expanding settlement activity. Unequal Water Use In 2009, the World Bank issued a highly critical evaluation ( pdf ) of Israeli behaviour in the water sector in which it noted that Israel had seriously obstructed the Palestinian's ability to operate an effective water system. Another independent study ( pdf) conducted by Amnesty International in the same year came to a similar conclusion. Two years later the French National Assembly report ( pdf ) on its mission to the Palestinian territories concluded that Israel was exercising "water apartheid". Israel attacked these reports and the institutions that prepared them, but in a brief attempt to prove their conclusions wrong, rapidly approved a few Palestinian water projects. Within months, however, Israel returned to its delay/disapprove, quid pro quo approval strategy. It is the data comparisons of Israeli and Palestinian water use that are ultimately the most damning. The World Health Organization 's minimum standard for domestic water use is 100 litres a day. However, Israel has kept Palestinian water use in the West Bank and Gaza to well below that minimum, while providing significantly higher amounts for its own citizens and the Jewish settlers in the West Bank. On average, Israelis use 240-300 litres a day, while Palestinians living under Israeli military rule in the West Bank are limited to 20 (in some rural areas) to 79 (in urban areas), and in Gaza, the water supply is not fit for human consumption. The inequality is even more glaring when considering that Israeli settlers living next to Palestinians in the West Bank use an average of 400 litres/day. In many places, Palestinians struggle to get enough water just to survive, while illegal Israeli settlers living right next to them water lush green lawns and fill swimming pools. READ MORE: Water deal tightens Israel's control over Palestinians While I served as PA Minister of Water and PWA head, we launched a reform process that restructured the Palestinian water sector at all levels: managerial, regulatory and service provision. We expressed deep concern about the failure to provide fair access to the water resources in the Jordan River or those in the West Bank aquifer and opposed Israel's rigorous blockade of Gaza, including its bombing of water and wastewater facilities during its 2009 Gaza war.

This initiative would allow the PWA to complete most of its projects with useful Israeli advice, but without the threat of Israeli veto, and thus provide better access to water for Palestinian communities. I also announced that we would no longer cooperate with the quid pro quo system used by Israel to support its programme expanding illegal settlements. Israel responded by punishing all West Bank Palestinians by withholding approval of all PWA water projects. The continuing Israeli intransigence created serious water shortages and severe pressure on the PA to give in to Israeli demands, and by early 2017 the PA had returned to a JWC process only slightly modified in ways that allow some limited water projects – apart from drilling and rehabilitation of wells - to be implemented without prior JWC approval. Israel's occupation authorities and import restrictions still control the extent and pace of Palestinian water development. Steps towards Real Israeli-Palestinian Cooperation Despite these challenges, we in Palestine would like to enjoy a cooperative relationship with Israel on water issues. Israel and the Palestinian Authority could make a good start towards that cooperation by focusing on three joint initiatives. First, Israelis could work together with Palestinians to revise the operating rules of both the JWC and Military Civil Administration, with a goal of applying general international practice as occurs on shared aquifers and basins. Secondly, Israel could join the PWA in giving a high priority to implementing a respected 2011 study of the water crisis facing Gaza residents, including recommendations for a sequential programme to develop an effective water supply, distribution and use system in Gaza. The water supply in Gaza is currently more than 97 percent polluted, endangering the health of all Gazans and threatening the failure of the Gaza portion of the Coastal Aquifer. Israel could begin by providing the energy needed to support the proper functioning of all Gaza's water and wastewater facilities. OPINION: Celebrating water cooperation: Red Sea to Dead Sea Finally, Israel could join Palestine in accepting International Water Law standards for allocating water within the Jordan River Basin by signing the 1997 UN Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses. This action would signal Israel's acceptance of a fair and equitable process for allocating and managing joint water resources. Israel should not build and use its power by depriving the Palestinians it has occupied for the past 50 years of access to their fair share of their natural resources. While the diplomatic process remains largely frozen between Israel and the Palestinians, by moving forward together to solve our water problems we can chart a course forward that will safeguard the vital resource of water for the future of both peoples.

Yarmouk camp in southern Damascus remains under the control of armed fighters [File: Moayad Zaghmout/Reuters] Yarmouk camp remains open to the dead and closed to the living. This is the ironic reality in the southern Damascus camp for Palestinian refugees , which has been under partial or total siege since late 2012, barring most residents from exit and re-entry. Yarmouk has all but emptied since then, with multiple attacks causing mass displacements. Hundreds of Palestinians have died in and around Yarmouk in recent years, either as a result of starvation or a lack of access to medical supplies. But through a complex bureaucratic process, those who died outside of the camp have been able to secure burial within its borders. For nearly two years, Syrian and Palestinian officials have been helping to facilitate the process of returning bodies to Yarmouk for burial. In Damascus, the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) arranges for the bodies to be transferred to Yarmouk, while a Syrian security agency approves a permit allowing them to be brought across a checkpoint separating regime-held and rebel-controlled areas of Damascus. A local organisation, known as the Palestinian Civil Committee, then liaises with Syrian opposition groups in areas bordering Yarmouk to handle funeral arrangements. There have been several such burials in recent weeks, including that of a one-year-old girl. 'They need graves' "People are dying every day, and they need graves," Ibrahim, a Palestinian in Damascus who declined to give his last name for security reasons, told Al Jazeera. "Before, people were struggling to find cemeteries to bury their loved ones." More than 315 Palestinians have been buried in Yarmouk under this arrangement since the first burial in January 2016, according to local activists and relief workers. A manager with the civil committee told Al Jazeera that people insisted on returning bodies to Yarmouk for burial "because of the symbolism of the camp and also because of the high prices of graves in cemeteries in Damascus", with the cost for a grave in Damascus pegged at around 300,000 Syrian pounds ($580), compared with 10,000 pounds ($19) in Yarmouk. Bodies must cross front lines through areas controlled variously by regime forces, rebels and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) fighters. Ibrahim has had two relatives buried in Yarmouk, accompanying their bodies through the south of the city. "If you are in a regime area, you have to obey their laws, and the same in the opposition areas. In the camp, you have to follow ISIL's rules," Ibrahim said. Much of Yarmouk remains under ISIL's control after the group stormed the camp in 2015. Symbolic ritual The return to Yarmouk is suffused with symbolism. Palestinian-Syrians sometimes refer to the devastated camp as their piece of Palestine in lieu of Palestine itself. Some 4,500 civilians currently remain inside Yarmouk, compared with a prewar Palestinian population of around 150,000, according to aid agencies. "Everyone who has been displaced from Yarmouk has the hope and desire that one day they will go back ... alive or dead," local relief worker Obaydah al-Masri told Al Jazeera. "The people who are returned for burial in the camp were born there, raised there. They lived the best days of their lives there." With Yarmouk still besieged and under the control of armed groups, however, death is all too often the only way that displaced residents can return home. Recent clashes between rebels and ISIL fighters have resulted in fresh checkpoint closures and further access complications. Students and teachers have been refused entry to rebel-held southern Damascus, while civilians injured in clashes have been trapped inside the camp.

"It was easy because the PLO was there to help us, to the point that we buried my mother the same day that her body arrived to Damascus," Idrees told Al Jazeera. It can seem like a miracle of sorts that the passage of the dead involves so many groups active in the Syrian conflict: the regime, the PLO, opposition groups and armed fighters, who provide tacit permission for the process. 'Cemetery of the Palestinians' But local activists say that while the PLO might be honouring the dead, it is not doing enough to protect the living, either by helping to transfer emergency medical cases out of Yarmouk and the southern suburbs for treatment, or by pushing for better humanitarian access into and out of the camp. The status quo is still costing lives on a regular basis. In September, Palestinian refugee Mahmoud Daniel Fadel died of cancer in a neighbourhood next to Yarmouk. Activists and relief workers reportedly appealed to the PLO on several occasions to help get Fadel into Damascus for life-saving chemotherapy treatment, but to no avail. There are rare exceptions, and last week a handful of ill or injured Palestinians were transferred out of Yarmouk. But for most, the only route in and out of the camp is in a coffin. "Palestinians from Yarmouk aren't allowed to enter or leave the camp … except when they are dead and need to be buried," said former resident Muhammad al-Najmeh, who fled towards Germany in 2012. "Palestinians started calling the PLO the 'cemetery of the Palestinians.' It's supposed to be there to help Palestinians, but it can only help them once they've died."

Palestinian policemen loyal to Hamas stand guard as fuel tankers enter Gaza through Rafah border in June 2017 [File: Reuters] Hamas has handed over administrative control of five border crossings in Gaza to the Palestinian Authority. Wednesday's handover, the first in over a decade, is part of a deal agreed on in the latest round of Egypt-brokered reconciliation talks between Hamas and the PA-ruled Fatah political party in Cairo on October 12. Fatah spokesperson Osama Qawasmeh told Al Jazeera that no conditions were set by Fatah or Hamas for the handover. "The issue is simply a matter of restoring the status quo back under the Palestinian Authority's control, as was the case before the 2007 split," he said, referring to the political schism that ended with Hamas taking over the Gaza Strip after an attempted coup by US-backed Fatah strongman Mohammad Dahlan. The PA will take administrative charge of the three cargo crossings including the Karam Abu Salem crossing on the Egyptian border, as well as the Rafah and Beit Hanoun (Erez) crossings - the latter which is controlled by Israel in the north of the Strip. {articleGUID} In a statement on Tuesday, the PA minister of civil affairs, Hussein al-Sheikh, said the national unity government is prepared to work closely with Egyptian authorities to prepare the Rafah border crossing for operation by November 15, as specified by the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access . Rafah, the main border crossing in the south of the Gaza Strip, has been largely closed to Gaza's population of two million since Hamas took over. The other crossing, Erez, is located in the north of the strip and is run by Israel . The PA will also be in charge of the three cargo crossing points of Karni, Kerem Shalom (Karem Abu Salem) and Sufa. 'Better quality of life' Qawasmeh said that this handover would make the lives of Palestinians in Gaza "much easier". "This will no doubt help enable a huge part of people's lives to travel outside the Gaza Strip for whatever reason such as seeking medical treatment, undertaking a scholarship in a university, and leisurely travel," he said. "The movement of products will be facilitated quicker and will make it easier for import and export trade," he added. Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesperson, echoed his counterpart. "We hope that handing over control would lead to a better quality of life for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip," he told Al Jazeera. He stressed that handing over control was not a security issue, but rather a logistical one. Governing the 'mega-prison' However, Alaa Tartir, the programme director of the Palestinian policy network Al-Shabaka , said that the transfer of administrative border control "does not necessarily translate into a meaningful national reconciliation and unity". "Assuming that the mere replacement of personnel at the borders and crossings will lift the siege on Gaza is a naive and dangerous assumption," Tartir said. "It is a test to examine the fragility or durability of the recent reconciliation agreement." "It is crucial to acknowledge that Israel, as an occupying power, will remain the de facto holder of power over borders and crossings," he continued. "This will only change when the Israeli occupation ends. The Hamas-Fatah infighting about who will 'manage' the borders and crossings is merely a fight about who will 'govern' the mega-prison." Since Hamas took over in 2007, Israel has imposed an air, naval and land blockade on the Gaza Strip, a stretch of land measuring 51km in length and 11km in width. Earlier this year, the PA added pressure on Hamas' government by requesting Israel to cut off its electricity supply to Gaza. A matter of protocol Qawasmeh said that the closure of the border crossings was due to the absence of a "legitimate government" and that things are finally "going back to normal".

"The process of handing over control is just a matter of protocol," Qawasmeh said. "The real case is the decision of Hamas – which up until now has been positive – to completely transfer all powers to the national unity government as was stipulated in the latest reconciliation agreement." The next round of reconciliation talks will take place in Cairo on November 21, where Qassem and Qawasmeh said the discussion would focus on logistics of administration and security of the Gaza Strip. -Additional reporting by Farah Najjar SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Hamas Fatah Palestine Middle East

It was contained in a letter written by the then British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Lord Walter Rothschild, who was a leader of Britain's Jewish community. In the letter, Balfour expressed his support for "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people". The declaration, which is only 67 words long, is widely celebrated by Israelis. But Palestinians regard it as a betrayal which triggered the colonisation of their land.

British PM May plans to have dinner with Netanyahu to celebrate 100 years since the Balfour declaration [File: Maurizio Degl Innocenti/AFP/Getty Images] Thousands of Palestinian students have written letters to British Prime Minister Theresa May decrying the Israeli occupation, on the occasion of the Balfour Declaration centenary. Their messages will be submitted at the British consulate in Jerusalem on Thursday, November 2, 2017, exactly 100 years after Britain promised help in creating a "national home" for the Jewish people in Palestine . "The main goal is to give these high school students a chance to express themselves about the Balfour Declaration," Sadeq al-Khaddoor, Palestinian Authority Ministry of Education spokesman, told Al Jazeera. {articleGUID} "We want to show that we are able to express our views in a peaceful way, despite the injustice that has happened to our people." In the correspondence, some children question why that injustice has persisted and say they cannot live in peace like other children across the world. Some ask why the UK does not recognise a Palestinian state, and demand answers as to why the UK will not go back on its Declaration. The students also express gratitude to Britons who have demonstrated solidarity with the Palestinian people. One girl from Tubas wrote that her dying grandfather's only wish was that Britain take back its promise. For supporters of the Zionist cause, the Declaration marked the first milestone leading to the creation of Israel in 1948. {articleGUID} The Declaration was contained in a letter dated November 2, 1917, to leading English Zionist Lord Walter Rothschild from British Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour, promising British help in creating a "national home" for the Jewish people in Palestine. The letter conditioned British assistance on there being no "prejudice" against the rights of existing non-Jewish populations living in the area. After the defeat of the Ottoman Empire during the first world war, the UK became the dominant power in the region and established Mandate rule in Palestine. 'They're asking that their feelings are respected' In the letters, some students said that if it were not for the Declaration, their lands today would not be stolen. "They're asking for there not to be celebrations and that their feelings be respected," said Khaddoor. {articleGUID} Reports said that there are 100,000 letters in total. Meanwhile, PM May - who leads the ruling Conservative Party - will on Thursday join her Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, at London's Lancaster House for a dinner. The event is not being hosted by the government. In stark contrast, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a lifelong supporter of Palestinian rights, has reportedly declined the invite to the dinner with Netanyahu. Earlier in October, Palestinians celebrated Corby's refusal to attend a series of events in the UK celebrating the Balfour Declaration.

Subtitle of a poster of Crimea reads 'Love is stronger than hate' [Mariya Petkova/Al Jazeera] Two dramatic love stories, both featuring a Ukrainian and a Russian, have been making headlines in Moscow in recent weeks, albeit for different reasons. One of them enjoys the full sanction of the Russian authorities. About the other, they would rather not comment. Permissible love Alyona is a Ukrainian journalist from Kiev and a liberal; Sasha is a former marine from Sevastopol and a Russian patriot. They meet at the ruins of a medieval city in Crimea in the summer of 2013 and fall in love. As the anti-government protests in Kiev begin, Alyona joins them enthusiastically; Sasha does not approve. The two lovers argue over the Maidan; he thinks the protesters are "banderovtsi", that is, supporters of Stepan Bandera, leader of a radical nationalist Ukrainian movement during World War II; she thinks they are heroes. When the Russian army, or the so-called polite people , rolls into Crimea, he is happy because he thinks they will prevent an impending war. She is angry about it, and yet is unable to resist him and they spend a passionate night together. It then turns out that her Maidan friends are indeed "banderovtsi" who have been conspiring to start a war in Crimea. They kidnap Sasha, but she alerts the "polite people", who foil the plot heroically and save Crimea from a violent war. In the end, he goes to fight "against her own people", most probably in the Donbas, but she still loves him. This is, in short, the plot of the recently released Russian film Crimea. It is a Ukrainian love story with an official stamp of approval from the Russian defence ministry. The film was created at the initiative of Sergei Shoigu, Russian defence minister, and sponsored by the ministry which provided the military equipment and special forces for all its action-filled scenes. The director of the film, Alexei Pimanov, says he was in Crimea in March 2014 and witnessed the events presented in his film. "I consider Crimea not a governmental, but a national film," he told Russian media outlet MK. {articleGUID} Despite its patriotic flavour, the film was not much of a success. Kingsman: The Golden Circle, a Hollywood spy action film released just before Crimea, made double the profit and had double the viewership in Russia . Crimea's premiere was held in the Kremlin in late September amid a scandal: tens of thousands of accounts at Kinopoisk, one of Russia's main film websites, were found to have been hacked and used to boost its "anticipation" rating. After Kinopoisk discovered the hack and removed the fake votes, the film's rating fell from 60 to 21 percent. Currently, Crimea has an overall film score of 2.5/10; by comparison, Kingsman got 7.2/10. Forbidden love Tatyana is a 17-year-old Russian high-school student from Sochi and a big fan of 20th century Ukrainian history; Pavel is a 19-year-old philosophy student in Kiev and a Ukrainian patriot. Their love story starts in the Russian social network VKontakte in January 2017, where they discover they have a lot in common. They both are enthralled by the eventful life of Stepan Bandera and both like to read about Ukrainian nationalism. They soon fall in love and they start making plans to be together in Ukraine , to train as volunteers in a military camp and then go to Donbas. But when Tatyana applies for a passport, she gets a visit from the FSB. She is told that if she cooperates with them, meets Pavel and just asks him a couple of questions, she would be issued the passport. Tatyana tells her beloved everything and he agrees to the meeting, to be held in Belarus , which Tatyana visit without a passport. Under the supervision of Tatyana's mother, they meet in the Belarusian city of Gomel. The meeting is quick, they have enough time only to embrace each other and agree on future plans. It is the last time they see each other. Shortly after they part, Pavel is kidnapped and then transferred to Russia, where he now faces charges of "terrorism". {articleGUID} This love story is not a plot of a film. It is what Ukrainian media outlet Hromadskoe and Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta were able to uncover investigating the mysterious disappearance of a Ukrainian citizen in Belarus and his reappearance in detention in the Russian city of Krasnodar. The Belarusian authorities denied ever detaining Pavel but acknowledged that the Russians had put him on a "wanted" list. On September 13, almost three weeks after his disappearance, the Russian authorities finally acknowledged that Pavel was under arrest in Russia. The Russian government is yet to comment on Pavel and Tatyana's story. The Ukrainian government has handed an official protest note to Moscow and demanded that Pavel be released immediately, but to no avail. On October 18, the Krasnodar court extended his arrest until January 2018. Pavel has been charged with planning a "terrorist attack"; according to Russian media. The prosecution accuses him of encouraging Tatyana to plant a bomb in her school. Pavel is suffering from a life-threatening condition for which he was supposed to undergo surgery. According to his lawyer , the Russian authorities have refused to give him the medicine he needs and, as a result, his condition is worsening. Tatyana is also part of the court case: she told Novaya Gazeta that she has not received the passport she was promised.

Russian citizens carry a banner reading 'Great October Socialist Revolution' during a rally marking the anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution in central Moscow, Russia [Maxim Zmeyev/Reuters] Exactly one hundred years ago today, in the evening of October 25, 1917, the Winter Palace in Petrograd (today's St Petersburg) was stormed. This event marked the beginning of the Great October Revolution, one of the most significant political events of the twentieth century that shaped the course of history for decades ahead. Leading up to the events of October 25 was another revolution in late February 1917, which brought to power a group of leaders from bourgeois political parties that formed a provisional government headed initially by Georgy Lvov, a liberal reformer, and then by Aleksander Kerensky, a socialist. In early March of that year Tsar Nicholas II, who had ruled imperial Russia since 1894, abdicated. Five months later, Russia was pronounced a republic. Although the provisional government did introduce some reforms on the political front, prompting even Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin to declare Russia in April 1917 "the freest country in the world", it was the Red October Revolution that turned the old order completely upside down by inaugurating a socialist regime and making Soviet-style communism a global ideological and political force that lasted until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991. {articleGUID} Still, one hundred years later, the rise of the Bolsheviks to power continues to divide scholars, the chattering classes and even the educated public. There are several issues that are particularly divisive, such as whether the October Revolution was a popular insurgency or essentially a coup, and whether Stalinism evolved naturally from the basic principles and political strategies of Lenin or was an unexpected development. Likewise, there is still a great deal of ambiguity, disagreement and confusion over the nature of the regime that flourished in the Soviet Union after Lenin's death in 1924. For example, did the Soviet Union represent an "actual socialist society", a "degenerated workers' state", or simply a "totalitarian state economy" in which the communist ideology functioned as a mere instrument of political legitimisation and imperial rule? When it happened, the Great October Revolution produced global hysteria, untamed enthusiasm and hope about the possibility of the creation of heaven on earth (a new utopia) in equal measures. For the bourgeois classes everywhere, the inauguration of the Soviet regime was anathema to core values of the "western civilisation", while for radicals and communists it signified a natural culmination of the inevitable march of history towards human freedom and a social order devoid of exploitation. No room for mourning or celebration On the centenary of the Great October Revolution, an objective evaluation on socialism and the legacy of Soviet communism gives no room for mourning or celebration. It was essentially the epic story of an impossible dream that turned in due time into a political and historical nightmare because of the interplay of a vast array of factors that included "backward" socioeconomic conditions, outside intervention, an absence of democratic traditions, and misconceived notions about socialism and democracy. Hence, while you can easily romanticise about the October Revolution, the cold reality of history smacks you in the face. Dreams are surely renewable, and a new world is waiting to be born, but the possibilities available to create an equalitarian, socially just, ecologically friendly, and decent society lie outside the ideas, practices and policies of the October Revolution. For starters, the Great October Revolution was unlike the February Revolution which erupted as a result of spontaneous action by hundreds of thousands of hungry and angry men and women workers and militant troops. What happened in October 1917 was the outcome of a well-designed strategy on the part of the leader (Lenin) of a minority party (the Bolsheviks) to wrest control from the provisional government because of a strong ideological aversion to "bourgeois democracy" and desire for power. Unsurprisingly Lenin's call for "all power to the Soviets" ended up being something entirely different: all power went to the party and its politburo. The October Revolution was not a coup in itself, but neither was it a popular uprising that enjoyed the kind of mass support that the February Revolution had. In fact, it was not until the autumn of 1917 that Lenin's "land, peace, bread" slogan had been embraced by some workers in St Petersburg and Moscow. Yet, even this does not mean that the Bolshevik programme and Lenin's ideas of rule were accepted by the majority of the Russian people: In the November 1917 elections, the first truly free election in Russian history, Lenin's party received only one quarter of the vote, while the Social Revolutionaries managed to receive over 60 percent. Lenin had stomach neither for parliamentary democracy nor for sharing power with any other political organisation. His unwavering intent to establish socialism in Russia, regardless of the ripeness of the social and economic conditions, and his firm conviction that only the Bolsheviks represented the true interests of the workers, would compel him to adopt strategies and policies that would soon deprive the Revolution of whatever potential it had originally had for the establishment of a new social order based on workers' control of the means of production and democracy (which Lenin, sadly enough, associated with the "dictatorship of the proletariat"). {articleGUID} Indeed, not long after the November elections, Lenin would ban several opposition newspapers and unleash a campaign of "Red Terror" against all class enemies (with the Social Revolutionaries being the first victims following their uprising in Moscow in early July 1918). The orchestration of the "Red Terror," which lasted until the end of the Russian civil war, was assigned to Cheka (a Bolshevik police organisation that reported to Lenin himself on all anti-communist activities), thereby laying the foundations for the emergence of a full-fledged police state under Stalinism. The clearest illustration of how far to the "right" the Bolsheviks had moved following the outbreak of the October Revolution is the brutal repression of the Kronstadt rebellion in 1921 by Red Army troops. Disheartened by the Bolsheviks' dictatorial tendencies, a garrison of the key fortress of Kronstadt revolted in March 1921 against the communist government and the ideas of "war communism" - even though the Kronstadt sailors had been, back in 1917, among the strongest supporters of the October Revolution and the idea of "Soviet power". To be sure, they were, until then, in Lev Trotsky's own words, "the pride and joy of the revolution". With the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion, it became clear that Lenin's concept of the "vanguard party" and his understanding of the "dictatorship of the proletariat" did not permit dissent of any kind and that a socialist political order was to be based on one-party rule. As for the policy of "war communism", it ended a complete disaster. Lenin himself admitted as much in a speech on October 17, 1921, when he said, "we made the mistake of deciding to go over directly to communist production and distribution". But this did not mean that all Bolsheviks shared Lenin's views on "war communism" or that they embraced the policy that was followed in the 1920s by a partial return to the market system of production and distribution. The soon-to-be "new Tzar" Joseph Visarionovich Stalin, regarded the New Economic Policy as the betrayal of the October Revolution. His "revolution from above", launched in 1928 with the policy of collectivisation and dekulakisation (a campaign of political repressions, including arrests, deportations, and executions of millions of the more "well-to-do" p easants ) reopened the gates of hell and converted Soviet socialism once and for all into a barbarous and murderous regime. {articleGUID} Stalinism did not merely formalise the worst aspects of Leninism but became, in reality, an actual stumbling block for the transition into socialism both inside the Soviet Union and throughout the rest of the world where the ideas of social justice and equality continued to move the minds and hearts of millions of decent people. Hence, the end of Stalinism and the collapse of Soviet communism (which in the course of its 74 years did manage to turn a "backward" country into an industrialised nation that was able to defeat Nazism and make undeniable advances on several economic, cultural, and social fronts) mark simply the end of a dream turned into a nightmare. In this context, the legacy of the Russian Revolution obliges, one hundred years later, neither celebration nor mourning. Dreams are surely renewable, and a new world is waiting to be born, but the possibilities available to create an egalitarian, socially just, ecologically friendly, and decent society lie outside the ideas, practices and policies of the October Revolution.

Supporters of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny walk with a picture depicting President Vladimir Putin during a rally in St Petersburg, Russia [Anton Vaganov/Reuters] In Oscar Wilde's story, Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, the main character wanted to blow up one of his relatives. Because he didn't know anything about bombs, he decided to turn to someone with experience. Who in London could he ask for advice? A Russian nihilist, of course! In the late 19th century, Russians were always thought to be associated with revolutionary struggle and political terrorism. There is nothing surprising about that. Crowds of Russian anarchist intellectuals living in exile filled European cafes, while in Russia , revolutionaries periodically attempted assassinations of the Tsar (sometimes successfully), plotted big terror attacks and organised underground networks of banned groups and parties. What is more, practically all Russian cultural production of the 19th century was created by rebels. One of the biggest Russian poets, Alexander Pushkin, was openly sympathetic to the anti-serfdom rebellion of 1925. Fyodor Dostoyevsky was sentenced to death for participating in a revolutionary circle (the sentence was rescinded at the last moment and this unpleasant episode appeared in his novel, Idiot). Lev Tolstoy, while denouncing violence, was one of the most uncompromising critics of the tsarist regime and the Church; his writings were so radical that, if published today, would certainly be banned. {articleGUID} When, in the end, a revolution did happen in Russia, the democracy it established lasted a bit more than half a year, from February to October. With the Bolshevik October coup and the subsequent foundation of a totalitarian system, the revolution turned from a radical idea of free-thinking people to a repressive state cult. Streets, squares, and cities were named after revolutionaries, but in reality, Soviet citizens could not even think about a revolution, much less doubt the righteousness of the communist party. The regime, while preaching about the revolution as something good, physically destroyed people's ability to think critically and resist. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia breathed the air of freedom again, but not for long. Today, 100 years after the revolution, the country has gone back to its starting point. It again suffers from an economic crisis; the authorities again are trying to mobilise support among the population using the spectre of foreign enemies. And like 100 years ago, the patriotic upsurge amid war has exhausted itself; people have started worrying about domestic issues more and more. Just like 100 years ago, the State Duma doesn't do anything; the courts are not independent; and the authorities are actively using censorship, propaganda and the "secret police". Just like 100 years ago, a major part of the Russian intelligentsia is denouncing the Russian government-in-exile; the points of their criticism have not changed much. Putin's rule looks much more tsarist than Soviet. There is no Soviet "collective rule", no all-powerful party or a clear ideology and no strong repressive apparatus. But just like the monarchy, it grooms a bureaucratic aristocracy which has the liberty to distribute high-level positions at state-owned banks and corporations to its own children. The only difference is that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not have a son to be his successor (unlike his Azerbaijani and Belarusian counterparts). But in monarchies too, power is not always inherited; what is important is that there is no problem when its transfer happens - and that we already observed in 2008 when Dmitry Medvedev took up the presidency and then gave it back in 2012. Regardless of the economic situation, there will be a growing number of protests before the presidential elections. It is also important to point out that unlike the Soviet regime, Putin's rule does not rely so much on repression as much as what psychology calls "learned helplessness". In the 1960s, American psychologist Martin Seligman investigated this concept; during his experiments, he found that a dog in a cage receiving electric shocks at random would eventually learn that nothing it does can stop them and would not try to avoid them any more, falling into depression. This is a very good illustration of the psychology of a significant part of the Russian population. Over the past decades, Russians got used to the idea that they have no way of pressuring the authorities and stopped even trying to show any type of resistance. Unlike Soviet times, today the "cage" is open; the authorities are hardly able to suppress a mass protest. Recent protest experiences in the former Soviet republics and Arab countries show that even if the security apparatus is ready to use gunfire on protesters, that does not guarantee regime survival. In this sense, it's not just Vladimir Putin staying in the way of another revolution in Russia, it is the scepticism and melancholy of the general population. And this is the main difference between today's Russia and Russia of 1917. The main revolutionary factor back then was an active citizenry. The revolution erupted spontaneously and unexpectedly, but not without a prior history: it was preceded by mass labour strikes, the work of various political parties and movements, critical publications in the press (even if at times censored), and even the efforts of members of the State Duma who even if largely stripped of any power, continued to deliver fiery speeches (the likes of which have never been heard in today's Russian parliament). {articleGUID} Does this mean that there will not be a new Russian revolution? Of course, it doesn't. We know plenty of examples of revolutions happening in countries with much less developed civil societies and much more authoritarian regimes. What currently guarantees stability is the low unemployment rate (thanks to the government sector) and an average income that somewhat provides for a normal standard of living (around $600 at the moment). But there are also factors that the Russian government cannot control - like lower oil prices or harsher sanctions from the West - which could destroy the Russian economy. But regardless of the economic situation, there will be a growing number of protests before the presidential elections. The youth, the backbone of this protest wave, have not had the time to find out what "learned helplessness" means. Whether their spirit could spark a revolution is difficult to say, but chants "Down with the Tsar!" already rang loud and clear at the last protest in Moscow, which by the way, happened just a few hundred metres from Revolution Square.

Up to 4,000 Russian nationals could have joined ISIL, Russian President Putin has said [File: Reuters] Moscow, Russia - Abdulmajid Abakarov, a 12-year-old boy from Russia's troubled province of Dagestan, had not seen his mother in three years. Zagidat Abakarova, 34, and her two younger children were "forcibly held" in Syria by her husband, who had joined ISIL, Russian officials said. On October 21, the boy waited for her at the airport in Grozny, the capital of neighbouring Chechnya , in an agitated crowd of civilians, security officers and journalists. Days earlier, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov announced the arrival of seven "rescued" wives and 14 children of Russian ISIL fighters who had been killed, sentenced to death or jailed in Syria or Iraq . Kadyrov, who rules war-scarred Chechnya and cultivates an image of Russia's top Muslim leader , guaranteed the women's safe return. The most common charge fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) face in Russia is "organisation of or participation in an illegal armed group". It is a crime punishable by up to 10 years in jail, but the charge can be dropped if suspected fighters give themselves up to police. Abdulmajid knew exactly what he would do when he saw his mother. "I will kiss her, tell her I'll never let her go," the lanky, almond-eyed boy said shyly, in an interview with local media. But shortly after her arrival, Zagidat and another returnee, Muslimat Kurbanova, were detained by police who drove from Dagestan to apprehend them. On October 24, they were arrested for two months and are awaiting trial. Zagidat is not even allowed to breast-feed her three-month-old daughter. The arrests "undermine further policies of North Caucasus authorities, [federal] Russian authorities, to return Russian nationals from conflict zones," Galina Tarasova of the Memorial human rights group told Al Jazeera. '4,000 Russians fight for ISIL' "Soon, very soon, blood will spill like a sea." This is the chorus of a nasheed, a religious chant released in Russian by Al-Ajnad Media, ISIL's propaganda branch, in 2015. The lyrics mention the "return" to Islamic law-based rule of Russian regions where up to 20 million Muslims dominate demographically or form a sizeable minority: the North Caucasus, Tatarstan, the Urals Mountains and annexed Crimea. Almost 3,500 Russians fight for ISIL, making Russia the largest source of recruits - ahead of Saudi Arabia and Jordan, the Soufan Center, a US-based think-tank, said on October 24. {articleGUID} As ISIL is nearing collapse, the think-tank warned that the fighters' homelands face a " huge challenge " of returnees who are battle-hardened, indoctrinated and angry. The Soufan Center said some 400 fighters have so far returned to Russia. In 2015, Tunisia was the number one source of ISIL recruits (6,000) with Saudi Arabia (2,500) and Russia (2,400) trailing behind, the group said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on October 25 that he "doubts the figures" from groups, but did not specify whether the official figure was lower or higher. He added that monitoring the returnees is "one of the priorities" of Russia's security agencies. But Russian President Vladimir Putin said in February that "up to 4,000" Russian nationals fight for ISIL. In June, he said that ISIL is "preparing plans to destabilise" ex-Soviet Central Asia and Russia's southern regions. Between January and July, 190 suspected fighters were sentenced to jail for "organisation of or participation in an illegal armed group", the charge Zagidat is facing, according to the Supreme Court's statistics. Last year, the figure was 245, in 2011 - 133. There are no figures on how many of them are linked to ISIL, and rights groups often doubt the accusations. "In many cases, a formal accusation is presented without any veritable proof that the people have really been there," Memorial's Tarasova said. "The accusations are rather vague, and, as a rule, are based on confessions of individuals" that are often received under pressure or in return for promises to leave their families alone, she said. The Caucasus conundrum Most of the Russian ISIL fighters come from the North Caucasus, a southern region that lies close to Iraq's Baghdad or Syria's Raqqa than to Moscow. More than 100 ethnic groups co-exist there amid unemployment, corruption and feuds over resources and power. One of the North Caucasus provinces is Chechnya, where a secular separatist uprising of the 1990s morphed into the "Caucasus Emirate", an armed group that conducted hundreds of attacks, killing thousands of civilians, security officers, officials, pro-Kremlin imams and even owners of alcohol stores. In 2012, 700 people were killed and 525 wounded in the region making it the hotbed of Europe's "most violent conflict", the International Crisis Group think-tank said. The conflict "is being constantly fuelled by a string of various factors starting from gravest human rights abuses to corruption, clanship, injustices, very strong social stratification, badly functioning government institutions that have essentially been privatised", Ekaterina Sokirianskaia, director of the Conflict Analysis and Prevention Centre, a Moscow-based think-tank, told Al Jazeera. Security forces stoke the conflict with abductions, torture and extrajudicial killings of Muslims merely suspected of joining "radical" groups, Human Rights Watch said. Even if a young man is blacklisted by mistake, interrogations, beatings and threats force him to join the "radicals", the group said. Last December, seven suspected fighters were killed in Chechnya, and four of them were wounded, Memorial said. One of the wounded was 18-year-old Madina Shakhbieva; her relatives were security officers that killed and buried her secretly, the rights group alleged. Since 2013, North Caucasus fighters started pledging allegiance to ISIL and other groups in Syria and Iraq - and flocked there in droves. Security agencies forced them out of Russia before the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, experts claimed, and the number of killings and attacks plummeted. "The departure of militants, cuts in [foreign] funding, a split among Caucasus Emirate leaders, most of whom pledged allegiance to ISIL and were killed later, decreased the activity of the Islamist underground," Varvara Pakhomenko, one of Russia's leading Northern Caucasus experts, told Al Jazeera. ISIL declared war on Moscow and took responsibility for at least a dozen attacks, including the 2015 bombing of a passenger plane over the Sinai Peninsula that killed 224 mostly Russian tourists returning from Egypt. It became the largest air crash in Russia's history, and Moscow stopped flights to Egypt altogether. A whipping girl Although most of ISIL recruits come from North Caucasus, an exemplary A-student from Moscow became the poster child of religious "extremism". Varvara Karaulova, a 21-year-old philosophy student, converted to Islam after falling in love with an ISIL fighter she met online. Turkish police detained her in 2015 as she was trying to cross into Syria to marry him, and her odyssey generated enormous media buzz back home. Charges against her were dropped, and Russian security officers used her social network accounts to identify ISIL recruiters. But Karaulova was later sentenced to four and a half years in jail last December in a trial her father described as a "show" aimed at frightening other potential ISIL recruits. "What I regretted was that after her return I let them communicate with recruiters on behalf of Varvara, and that [communication] was what she was accused of," Pavel Karaulov told Al Jazeera. After a month in a training camp, I realised there was no religion; we were just being used. For them, we were cannon fodder, expendable material Rakhman Bagbekov, 20-year-old returnee fighter now in jail Given all the pressure returnees face back home, most ISIL fighters opt to stay out of Russia trying to settle in Ukraine , Turkey or Middle Eastern nations. "Few real combatants return," said Sokirianskaia, of the Conflict Analysis and Prevention Centre. "The returnees are those who have left recently and quickly got disappointed." One such returnee was Rakhman Bagbekov, a 20-year-old theology student who was sentenced to 15 years in jail for spending a month at an ISIL training camp in Syria. "After a month in a training camp, I realised there was no religion; we were just being used. For them, we were cannon fodder, expendable material," Bagbekov told the Argumenty i Fakty weekly, speaking from prison.

"There is no danger yet, and those who return have not manifested themselves," Alexey Malashenko, a senior expert with the Moscow-based Institute for the Dialogue of Civilizations, told Al Jazeera. "But if ever there is a crisis, some trouble, and the protest is only expressed in an Islamic way, then these guys who have not had enough of war, who are filled with 'mujahideen' energy, will have their say."

Trump and Putin during G20 summit [Carlos Barria/Reuters] President Donald Trump has said that Russia was hurting United States efforts to disarm North Korea of its nuclear weapons, while China has been helpful. In an interview with Fox Business Network, Trump said it would be easier to resolve the North Korea nuclear issue if the US had a better relationship with Russia . "China is helping us and maybe Russia's going the other way and hurting what we're getting," Trump said of the North Korea situation. Although North Korea signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1985, it has since then been found by the International Atomic Energy Agency in noncompliance. Pyongyang asserts it will keep building up its nuclear arsenal in "quality and quantity". US officials estimate it has 60 nuclear weapons, whereas independent experts estimate it has enough uranium to produce six new nuclear bombs a year. In total, the US is in possession of 6,800 nuclear warheads. A partial test ban treaty was ratified by the US in 1963, but the Senate has since rejected ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty. "At the beginning of 2017, the US Defense Department maintained a stockpile of an estimated 4,480 nuclear warheads for delivery by more than 800 ballistic missiles and aircraft," reported the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. In recent days, a series of weapons tests by North Korea and a string of increasingly combative exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have ratcheted up tensions. Trump has negotiated with China to help rein in North Korea's nuclear program. China, North Korea's sole major ally, accounts for more than 90 percent of trade with the isolated country. Trump said in a tweet that he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday and raised the issue of North Korea. US-Russia relations have been strained over allegations that Russia had meddled in the 2016 US presidential election, Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and its backing of the Syrian government. "I think we could have a good relationship" with Russia, Trump said. "I think the North Korean situation would be easier settled." Trump said during last year's campaign that he hoped to improve relations with Moscow. SOURCE: Al Jazeera and news agencies Asia Pacific US & Canada Donald Trump Kim Jong-un Russia
RenderPagesVideo('5630548021001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); The former campaign manager of US President Donald Trump and another aide have been charged with conspiracy against the US and money laundering, the first charges stemming from an FBI probe into alleged Russia meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. Paul Manafort and his former business associate Rick Gates surrendered to the FBI early on Monday. The Department of Justice announced the pair were being charged on 12 counts, including conspiracy against the US, money laundering and other financial charges. These are the first charges in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential elections and collusion with Trump's team. Both Manafort and Gates pleaded not guilty to the charges, according to the Associated Press. Manafort was released on a $10m bond, while Gates' bond was set at $5m. They were both placed on house arrest. There were no charges related to specifically to the Trump campaign. According to the indictment, Manafort and Gates hid "tens of millions of dollars" from their work in Ukraine from 2006 through at least 2016 by laundering "the money through scores of United States and foreign corporations , partnerships and bank accounts". The news comes after reports last week that a grand jury had approved the first criminal charges in Mueller's investigation. The charges had been expected since August when the FBI seized documents from Manafort's home. Trump steps in Despite charges that relate to dealings in 2016 and 2017, Trump tweeted on Monday that "this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign". He added that there "is no COLLUSION!" - a statement he has repeatedly said in reference to the probe into Russia's alleged meddling. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters that Monday's announcement "has nothing to do with the president, has nothing to do with the president's campaign or campaign activity". The Kremlin has repeatedly rejected allegations that it tried to influence the US presidential election. The Department of Justice also said on Monday that George Papadopoulos, who served on the Trump advisory team during the 2016 campaign, pleaded guilty on October 5 to "making false statements to FBI agents". 'The beginning of a process' Al Jazeera Kimberly Halkett, reporting from the White House, described the charges as "pretty significant". "We've known for some time that Paul Manafort was the focus of Robert Mueller's investigation," she said. Laura Brown of George Washington University, told Al Jazeera that these charges mean the investigation is "moving from a political story into a legal one". "It is very disconcerting for anyone who is involved in the Trump presidential campaign in terms of what was done to make sure that President Trump could secure the nomination," Brown said. "What we have to realise is that this is a beginning of a process starting with Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, but it certainly could extend to some of those we have heard throughout the summer and over the year that Robert Mueller is investigating." Who is Paul Manafort? Manafort served as Trump's former campaign manager from March 2016 until he was reportedly forced out in August 2016 after coming under fire for allegedly taking millions of dollars of undisclosed payments for lobbying efforts on behalf of a pro-Russia Ukrainian political party. He became a key figure in the investigations into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election. He has denied any wrongdoing. Manafort has been cooperating in the investigations surrounding the Russia probe. Much of the media attention on Manafort focuses on a meeting he had with Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and a Russian government lawyer, who claimed to have incriminating information against Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic challenger in the last year's election. According to the Associated Press, Manafort has been a subject of a long-standing FBI probe into his dealings in Ukraine and the work he has done for the country's former President Viktor Yanukovych .

A Syrian opposition leader said the proposed conference would be akin to a dialogue between the regime and itself [Mukhtar Kholdorbekov/Reuters] The Syrian opposition attending the latest round of peace talks in Astana has rejected the Russian call for a Congress in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi. The "Syrian Congress on National Dialogue" proposed by Moscow during the two-day talks in the Kazakh capital is expected to discuss the reconciliation between all of the warring parties, political reform and discuss the proposed new Syrian constitution. "This is a Russian deception," said Fateh Hassoun who headed the Syrian opposition military delegation to the 7th round of Astana talks to end six-year-old Syria war. "We don't trust the Russians because they are part of the war and they are fighting on behalf of the regime on the ground," he added. {articleGUID} The Astana talks were attended by the Syrian opposition, the Syrian regime, Turkey , Iran and Russia to discuss the implementation of past agreements. The Russian delegation said the conference would be held on the 18th of this month and can be held either on the Russian Hmeimim military base in Latakia or in Sochi. But the Syrian opposition accused Moscow of trying to divert and eventually control the peace process in Syria by shifting the venues from Geneva and Astana to a Russian-controlled Hmeimim-Sochi process. Syrian opposition leader Mohamad Alloush said the proposed conference would be akin to a dialogue between the regime and itself. Sticking point Ahmad Ramadan, a spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition, one of the main Syrian opposition groups participating in the talks, said the Coalition would not participate in any negotiations with the regime outside the Geneva venue or without UN sponsorship. We don't trust the Russians because they are part of the war and they are fighting on behalf of the regime on the ground Fateh Hassoun The talks in Astana however, made some progress in terms of getting Russia to commit to maintaining and expanding the de-escalation zones. The opposition has worked to cement the agreement on de-escalation zones in Idlib province and in and around Damascus. However, the issue of prisoner exchange between the regime and the opposition remained a sticking point during the talks. The opposition contends that they succeeded in advancing the issue with the help of the Kazakh government, the American and the French delegation, but the Iranian delegation objected to it. {articleGUID} "The Iranians have been evasive and tried to obstruct the agreements throughout the talks in Astana," Ayman al-Asemi, a member of the Free Syrian Army's military council, told Al Jazeera. "The Iranians are doing in order to prevent any future investigation of their role in committing war crimes inside Syria," he added. Ahmad Kamel, a Syrian journalist based in France and a supporter of the opposition, said the Russians want complete surrender of the Syrian opposition. "They are practically repackaging the same old Baath regime of President Bashar al-Assad," he said. "But what we are offered here is a 100 percent, inflexible and total control of the same old regime. It would be a betrayal of hundreds and thousands of victims who lost their lives and their homes."

Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman photographed in Riyadh on October 24 [Fayez Nureldine/AFP/Getty Images] Was Saturday a "Red Wedding" moment for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia? As the plot thickens in Riyadh, here's a roundup of the chatter on the streets. It started off with the resignation of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, a clearly orchestrated move produced and executed by his paymasters in Riyadh. Hariri announced on a Saudi-owned channel, from the Saudi capital, that he was resigning his post in protest at foreign intervention in Lebanon's domestic affairs. The irony was lost on him. The ostensible reason he gave, as he invoked his late father's name, was that he too is threatened with assassination. As the day turned into evening, there were reports of explosions being heard close to the King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh. It transpired that Houthi rebels (linked to Iran and allied with former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who is partially linked to the United Arab Emirates) had fired at least one ballistic missile from Yemen towards Riyadh. It put an exclamation point on the fact that the war in Yemen is far from over - more than two years since Saudi Arabia launched operation "Decisive Storm." As the clock inched to midnight another bombshell was dropped; this time by the Saudis: A royal decree ordering the arrest of several princes, billionaires, and notable figures , as well as the sacking of senior government officials. Some were the sons of the late King Abdullah. One was the head of the Saudi National Guard. All three of these developments will have seismic implications, not just on Saudi Arabia, but on the region and beyond. {articleGUID} The resignation of Hariri, or sacking by his Saudi sponsors, should sound the alarm bells for any government that doesn't want to see another war erupt in the region. A lot of chatter involved Israel. It's no secret that Israel has been conducting military exercises on its northern front for several months now. While Hezbollah has been busy helping prop up the Assad regime in Damascus, Tel Aviv has been developing its missile defence systems. Sooner or later, it will want to test those in real-life scenarios, as the logic would have it. Forcing Hariri to quit the government would help Israel frame any aggression against Lebanon as an attack on Iranian proxies. With Gaza politically neutralised for now, following Hamas' handover of power to the Palestinian Authority, Israel could very well see this as an optimal time to strike. Such an attack would also provide a perfect opportunity for the West to test the new Saudi leadership's "moderate" credentials: Would it cheer Israel on? In Yemen, the war has cost the Saudi economy hundreds of millions of dollars. This war launched by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman to restore Sanaa's legitimate government and put Iran in check has failed to do either. But it has succeeded in killing thousands of innocent people, displacing millions, and helping Tehran position itself as the defender of the oppressed in the Middle East. The targeting of Riyadh could push the young prince to be even more reckless and destructive in his ongoing expedition in Yemen. What's not so clear is the motive behind the mass arrests and sackings that took place in the wee hours of Sunday morning. Removing the head of the National Guard and a one-time contender to the throne is an obvious play to consolidate power by Bin Salman. {articleGUID} However what's more puzzling is the detention of billionaire prince Alwaleed Bin Talal. On paper, Bin Talal and Bin Salman are a match made in heaven: Both want to transform Saudi Arabia into a "secular" society, both detest the idea of democracy and liberalism, and both are equally willing to hand over the kingdom's wealth and sovereignty to the United States. Earlier I spoke to a contact who used to work for the billionaire prince. He told me that a possible reason for his detention was Alwaleed's refusal to put up money to help prop up Saudi's staggering economy. The message from Bin Salman to the country's wealthy elite is: Pay up or get locked up. In the Saudi version of Game of Thobes, the 32-year-old Bin Salman shows that he is willing to throw the entire region into jeopardy to wear the royal gown. His actions have already all but destroyed the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC); Yemen can no longer be referred to as a functioning state; Egypt is a ticking time bomb; and now Lebanon may erupt. There's a lot to worry about.

RenderPagesVideo('5460763226001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Qatar-Gulf crisis What is the GCC? When did the crisis start? Why are they cutting ties? Qatar's response Consequences for people living in Qatar Flight routes Four months since Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt imposed a blockade on Qatar, little progress has been made towards a resolution. On May 23, Qatar woke up to news of a hack attributing false statements to the emir of Qatar. The fake news was aired on several UAE and Saudi-owned networks in the Gulf, sparking a diplomatic breakdown. The Saudi-led group imposed an embargo on Qatar, with air, sea and land borders shut down, and Qatari diplomats and residents were expelled from the blockading countries. Despite calls for a resolution, the countries remain at an impasse. Here is a breakdown of how the diplomatic crisis has unfolded and what it entails for the region. READ - Qatar diplomatic crisis: All the latest updates When did Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt cut ties with Qatar? The announcements came in the early morning (5:50am local time, or 02:50 GMT) of June 5, 2017. Bahrain was the first to announce the severing of ties, followed shortly after by Saudi Arabia , the UAE and Egypt . A few days later, Jordan also announced that it would scale back its diplomatic ties with Qatar and shut down the Al Jazeera bureau in Amman. Why did these countries cut ties with Qatar? The four countries have claimed that Qatar works to support "terrorism", maintains cordial relations with Iran and meddles in the internal affairs of their countries. What has Qatar's response been? The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Qatar responded to the initial announcements by saying that there was "no legitimate justification" for the actions taken by the four countries to sever diplomatic relations. It added that the decision was a "violation of its sovereignty" and that it would work to ensure that it would not affect the citizens and residents of Qatar. Throughout, Qatar has strongly rejected the accusations levelled against it, viewing the campaign as an attempt to impose custodianship over the tiny nation. Both the emir of Qatar and the country's foreign minister have reiterated that Qatar is willing to negotiate with the boycotting countries, and have welcomed calls from international leaders for the parties to sit down around a table. "The countries who imposed the blockade on the state of Qatar interfere in the internal affairs of many countries, and accuse all those who oppose them domestically and abroad with terrorism. By doing so, they are inflicting damage on the war on terror," Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in September. "We have refused to yield to dictations by pressure and siege." READ MORE: Who is Qatar's emir? What are the roots of this conflict? There was a previous diplomatic rift in 2014 between Qatar and other Gulf countries. Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain pulled out their diplomats, claiming that Qatar supported armed groups. However, the border remained open and Qataris were not expelled. Tensions with Qatar have generally revolved around its alleged support for political Islamic movements, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, as well as complaints about the Al Jazeera Media Network, which is based in Doha. These tensions were possibly exacerbated by the Arab Spring in 2011, when Saudi Arabia and Qatar were seen as backing different sides. On June 7, the Saudi foreign minister said that Qatar must cease its support of groups such as Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. "We want to see Qatar implement the promises it made a few years back with regard to its support of extremist groups, to its hostile media and interference in affairs of other countries," Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters in Paris in June. What does the cutting of ties entail? The severing of ties as a diplomatic concept usually entails a recall of diplomatic representatives and the closing of diplomatic missions by the country that is taking the step. The country initiating the move can also ask the diplomatic representatives of the other party to leave their country. This is usually utilised by governments at times of serious complications in relations between states. OPINION: The GCC will ride out the storm In the case of the current Gulf crisis, several other dimensions have been added. Bahrain and Egypt both gave Qatari embassies 48 hours to implement their respective departure orders, while recalling their own diplomats and charge d'affaires. The UAE and Saudi Arabia gave Qatari citizens who were residents in or visiting the UAE two weeks to depart and ordered their citizens in Qatar to return. Saudi Arabia went further, withdrawing Qatari troops from the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have also closed land, air and sea passage to all vessels and vehicles coming from or going to Qatar. The blockade has disrupted business, education and transport links among Qatar and its neighbours, while also tearing apart families whose members held different passports. By mid-September, Qatar's National Human Rights Committee had received 3,346 complaints, 620 of which were from families affected by the measures.

Nobody knows how long the land, air and sea boundary closures will remain in effect, as they have been implemented by Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt. Qatar has not reciprocated. Several world leaders have called for the parties to this dispute to begin a process of negotiations in order to end the stalemate. Diplomatic efforts have abounded, including by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and French President Emmanuel Macron, who has appointed a special envoy to address the crisis. Kuwait's emir has been an active mediator from the beginning of the crisis, travelling from one Gulf capital to the next in an attempt to bridge the gap between the blockading countries and Qatar. What is the GCC? GCC stands for Gulf Cooperation Council. This is a political and economic alliance of countries in the Arabian peninsula including Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman , Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It was established in 1981 and its aim is to enhance cooperation and close relations among its members. Is the GCC going to survive? Kuwait's emir has been mediating between the GCC countries involved in the current dispute. According to Giorgio Cafiero of Gulf State Analytics, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Washington, both Kuwaitis and Omanis believe that an escalation of the conflict could be detrimental to the future of the GCC. PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY What are the economic consequences for Qatar? With Qatar's estimated $335bn of assets in its sovereign wealth fund, along with its newly expanded port that allows it to continue exporting natural gas and importing sea goods, the small Gulf nation appears poised to weather the sanctions. Due to their heavy reliance on oil and gas exports, the GCC states maintain weak trade and investment ties with each other, limiting the economic effects of their dispute. Are flight routes affected? Qatar Airways flights initially had to take an easterly route to fly only over airspace that was open to them. However, in August, the International Civil Aviation Organization approved some new routes for Qatar Airways that would allow it to cut through Emirati and Bahraini airspace. This was based on an application presented by Qatar to the international aviation body. According to Alan Peaford, editor-in-chief of Aerospace Magazine , Qatar Airways' flight routes would be the most disrupted if Gulf airspaces were closed off. He noted that there were two main air routes in and out of Qatar - over Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, with the latter controlling most of the Gulf airspace. "The real problem would be if airspace closes. Not just for Qatar Airways passengers, but also for cargo, like food and fresh fruit that is flown into the country." How is the Trump administration involved? The GCC rift followed US President Donald Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia in May, where he met leaders of the Arab world. The night before Trump's visit, the former US defence secretary, Robert Gates, offered a scathing assault on Qatar, criticising its support for "Islamists". The speech was delivered at a high-profile Washington conference, where Gates said: "Tell Qatar to choose sides or we will change the nature of the relationship, to include downscaling the base." After the dispute, the White House stated that Trump wanted to help sort out the diplomatic rift. Is Israel involved? // <![CDATA[ // ]]]] > Israel Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the split between the Gulf countries "opens possibilities for cooperation in the battle against terrorism" as it shows "that even in the Arab states they understand that the danger is not Zionism, but terrorism".

The Saudi-led coalition has managed to deepen political divide in Yemen, according to a confidential UN report [File: EPA] Saudi Arabia's military intervention in Yemen proved to be a "strategic failure", but a full and official withdrawal from that country is unlikely, analysts say. Last week, a series of leaked emails revealed that Saudi Arabia 's crown prince and defence minister, Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud , expressed a desire to end the war in Yemen during talks with former US officials. In the leaked emails, Mohammed bin Salman said that he '"wants out" of the two-year war he started in Yemen and that he was not against US rapprochement with Iran to end the conflict. Adam Baron, a Yemen analyst, says that a Saudi pull out is not going to be "complete" since the kingdom's security is largely reliant on Yemen's security. "Yes, the Saudis would like out of the war-but only on their own terms," Baron said. "What's broadly necessary would be a deal that ensures Saudi interests are preserved in Yemen, that heavy weaponry is handed over, an end to cross border attacks, and that any incipient Iranian influence is not allowed to gain permanence, let alone expand," Baron told Al Jazeera. "It's in the kingdom's interest to prevent Yemen devolving further into the chaotic abyss." The conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and has injured more than 40,000 to date. On Wednesday, an air strike on a hotel near the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, has killed at least 35 people, a local medic said.

Inflation was worsening and unemployment rates soared prior to the 2011 uprising. Money from the country's dwindling oil reserves has been wasted or stolen during overthrown President Ali Abdullah Saleh's 33-year reign. A 2015 UN report exposed Saleh's accumulated fortune of up to $60bn from corruption , extortion and embezzlement. Following Saleh's overthrow, a bloody civil war had erupted between Houthi rebels and supporters of Yemen's internationally recognised government. In September 2014, Houthi fighters took control of the capital, Sanaa, and pushed towards Yemen's biggest city, Aden. In response to Houthis' advances, a coalition of Arab states led by Saudi Arabia launched a military campaign in March 2015 to drive out the Houthis from Sanaa. The war has left various areas in dire need of humanitarian assistance and has enabled al-Qaeda to grow amid a security vacuum. Yemen, home to more than 27 million people, is on the verge of famine and in the middle of an " unprecedented " cholera outbreak. Referring to the Saudi-led war in Yemen, the UN has warned that the country is heading towards "total collapse." Currently, more than seven million people are on the verge of starvation due to border blockades and impoverishment from years of war, while about 80 percent of the population are reliant on some form of humanitarian aid. According to the UN, the world's largest humanitarian crisis is in Yemen. READ MORE: Who benefits from a weak and divided Yemen? Saudi Arabia's involvement has contributed to the country's humanitarian crisis , damaging Mohammed bin Salman's image both internationally and regionally, says Luciano Zaccara, Gulf politics researcher at Qatar University. A retreat means a defeat. It also means the collapse of the goals that the coalition came to achieve in Yemen. Yaseen al-Tamimi , Sanaa-based political analyst "The increasing criticism worldwide against the coalition attacks - considered the main reason behind the cholera epidemic that is killing thousands of civilians, the obscure situation of detainees, and the blockade of Sanaa airport and Hudaida port that is preventing humanitarian supply to arrive to the blocked areas controlled by the Houthis, are making this war very unpopular," Zaccara told Al Jazeera. "Allowing Sanaa airport to operate may help ease the critical humanitarian situation, even though it is still in the hands of the Houthis. Opening the airport will also allow thousands of people to leave the country to receive specialised treatment," he said. Similarly, a confidential UN report conducted by a UN Security Council panel of experts, has determined that the coalition continues to have "little operational or tactical impact on the ground". Although one of the Suadi-led offensive's main objectives was to reinstate Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi , the internationally recognised president who was exiled for 11 months, the political reality on the ground succeeded in dividing Hadi's supporters - some of whom are now fighting for legitimacy, according to the report. The south has formed a "competing political council ... with a stated goal of an independent South Yemen," the report pointed out. "It [the council] includes key officials and members of the legitimate government." The report goes on to examine how proxy militia groups, armed by members of the Saudi-led coalition, are pursuing individual agendas - the result of which has further weakened Hadi's position. If a Saudi "total or partial" pull out were to happen, says Zaccara, Saudi Arabia would ensure that an appropriate political solution would be implemented to preserve its image internationally. "Even though the Houthis may benefit from this, there is still strong criticism on their [Houthis] role in their controlled area that should be addressed," he added. INTERACTIVE: Yemen conflict - Who controls what But Sanaa-based political analyst, Yaseen al-Tamimi, does not anticipate a Saudi pull out, describing the possibility of a Saudi exit from Yemen as "dangerous". "A retreat means a defeat," Tamimi said. "It also means the collapse of the goals that the coalition came to achieve in Yemen. The coalition's withdrawal will not help the Saudi Kingdom in maintaining safe borders [with Yemen]," he told Al Jazeera. "There is no readily available solution that can fill the vacuum in this war-ravaged nation. The legitimate government of Yemen does not have the sufficient resources to continue the war or win it," Tamimi added. According to the report, both Houthi-Saleh forces, and the United Arab Emirates - a member of the coalition - "continue to engage in detention practices that violate international humanitarian law and human rights norms." The report references cases of prolonged disappearances that infringe on Yemeni people's individual liberties. While Houthi fighters continue to suppress voices of discontent, Yemenis say a Saudi exit will only strengthen the Houthis' grip. "The beneficiaries of the Saudi exit are the Houthis who want to rule Yemen," Halah Mansr, a Sanaa-based university student, told Al Jazeera. "We do not care how it will end and who will be at the helm of the country. Peace is all what we want." "Even the areas which were liberated by the coalition are unstable … This is not a success. It is a setback for the coalition - they haven't succeeded militarily, or diplomatically [by bringing stability to Yemen]," Mansr added. But some believe that an end to the war should be followed by other steps. "Yemenis are suffering here and abroad. When they [the coalition] pull out, life will change for the better," Leila Saleh, a university student, told Al Jazeera. "I want the coalition to pull out, and at the same time push the parties of the conflict to peace negotiations. This will be in the interest of Yemenis."

RenderPagesVideo('5588901708001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Al-Ruwais, Qatar - After more than 20 hours at sea, some 200 tall and gangly passengers are anxiously getting off a ship at Qatar's northern tip. Led ashore in the middle of the night, they kick and pull their ropes. They are racing camels that got caught up in a diplomatic crisis after Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt imposed a blockade on Qatar three months ago. Caretakers with sticks impatiently usher them onto trucks to take them to stables near the Shahaniya race track, where the racing season has just begun. Soon they will be running for thousands of dollars of prize money with robots on their backs. In total, 600 camels owned by Qataris and kept in the UAE have been brought back at the expense of the Qatari government. They were banned from competing in the UAE after the four Arab countries cut ties with Qatar in a dispute over foreign policy. Qatar, Kuwait and the UAE alternate as hosts for racing tournaments [Cajsa Wikstrom/Al Jazeera] Neutral territory The quartet expelled Qatari citizens and barred them from visiting, accusing Doha of supporting "terrorist groups". With borders closed and Saudi territory off limits to Qataris, transporting the camels from the UAE by land was not an option. So they were brought to Oman, which has stayed neutral in the crisis, and then put on ships. Kuwait, the UAE and Qatar alternate as hosts of the Arab Gulf region's camel-racing tournaments, and the four-legged participants are normally transported by trucks between the countries. This season, the sea will also be the only route open for Qataris bringing their camels to compete in Kuwait. OPINION: GCC crisis - Why is Kuwaiti mediation not working? The Qatari racing committee says no retaliatory measures will be taken against the UAE, with competitions in Qatar open to Emiratis should they wish to join. Sultan bin Saad al-Muraikhi, Qatar's minister of state for foreign affairs, alluded to the fate of Qatari camels in his speech at an Arab League summit in Cairo earlier this month, lashing out at the boycotting quartet. "Even the animals were not spared, you sent them out savagely," Muraikhi said, referring to thousands of livestock caught up in the crisis as Saudi Arabia closed its border with Qatar in June. Thousands of camels were brought back to Qatar when Saudi Arabia closed the border [Cajsa Wikstrom/Al Jazeera] Sweltering summer heat Camel owner Mohammed Abu Salem al-Marri told Al Jazeera that his animals had to walk in the sweltering summer heat for six days from deep inside the Saudi desert to reach the Qatar border. When his camels, together with thousands of other ones, arrived at the collection point, Marri said, they were dehydrated and exhausted and still had to wait for three days for the opening of the border. When that finally happened, crowds of camels pushed through, some tripping on each other and getting crushed. "It was hot, and there were a lot of camels. They were all trying to cross at once," Marri said. "We lost a baby camel. Others lost more. I saw many dead camels." Hundreds of camels are reported to have perished in the border stampede and as a result of the hardships arising from their rushed return. The reason many Qataris kept their camels in Saudi Arabia is that in the vast deserts there, they could roam around freely. In Qatar, which is tiny in comparison, they have to be kept fenced in. The government has banned herding to protect trees and plants. Marri now keeps his camels, some 70 of them, in pens in the rocky desert near the border. He hopes that the Qatari government will change regulations and establish a zone where herding of camels will be allowed. "Just like humans, camels need to move," he said. "They can't live fenced in." SOURCE: Al Jazeera ABOUT THE AUTHOR Cajsa Wikstrom Cajsa Wikstrom is a former online editor with Al Jazeera English. Middle East Qatar Saudi Arabia GCC
Saudi Arabia and Russia are now preferring pragmatic cooperation to costs from ideological confrontation, writes Issaev [Reuters] The Russian leadership has been waiting for Saudi King Salman to visit Moscow for a very long time. An official visit was first mentioned in the first half of 2015, when President Vladimir Putin , during a telephone conversation, invited the newly crowned monarch to Russia . Since then, the king's visit has been scheduled and postponed several times. In the past six months, the date of Salman's visit was reviewed three times: first, he was expected to be in Moscow in the middle of July, immediately after the G-20 summit in Hamburg, then in early August and, finally, in October. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5590853595001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5590853595001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > INSIDE STORY: Is Saudi Arabia on a reform path? (25:00) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY When the dates for Salman's visit to Moscow was finally confirmed, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubair called the visit "historical". This was a fully justified description as the history of Russian-Saudi relations is very dramatic. The Soviet Union was the first country to recognise the independence of the state created by King Abdulaziz. It established diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd (the name of the Saudi state until 1932) in 1926. However, when in 1938 the Soviet leadership executed its envoy to Riyadh, Karim Khakimov, who was a close friend of the Saudi king, the diplomatic relations between the two countries broke down. Relations were only re-established after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the establishment of the Russian Federation in 1991. As a result of this long pause in diplomatic relations, and the very difficult period of normalisation that followed, a Saudi king never visited the Soviet Union or the Russian Federation, until today. Faisal visited Moscow when he was still the foreign minister, Abdallah went there when he was the crown prince and even Salman himself visited the country when he was the emir of Riyadh, but today marks the first Saudi royal visit to Russia in history. OPINION: The Russian-Saudi rapprochement and Iran However, we should not expect any "breakthrough" decisions or agreements at the end of this "historic" visit. The limits of Russian-Saudi cooperation are obvious, as the two countries do not see eye to eye on many fundamental issues. They have developed economic ties over the last few decades, but these ties are not strong enough to transform the limited cooperation between the two countries into a partnership or alliance. Moreover, the export markets of Russia and Saudi Arabia are very similar, which makes it difficult for them to increase the volume of trade between the two countries any further. In many respects, the relative normalisation of Russian-Saudi relations that we are witnessing today is the result of extreme pragmatism and willingness to repress ideological differences on both sides. Yet, Saudi Arabia's young Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman was still right when he said during his last trip to Moscow in May 2017 that "the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia is going through one of the best moments." In the last two years, the crown prince personally worked towards ameliorating relations between the two countries and had a certain level of success. He regularly engaged in dialogue with Moscow, and he kept the communication channels open even when Russia began its military campaign in Syria and Saudi Arabia bogged down in the Yemeni crisis. From this point of view, the current easing of tensions between the countries, in spite of their conflicting regional interests, is largely due to Mohammad bin Salman's efforts. The crown prince factor In many respects, the relative normalisation of Russian-Saudi relations that we are witnessing today is the result of extreme pragmatism and willingness to repress ideological differences on both sides. Both Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman and the Russian leadership have personal interests in developing the relations between the two countries. First of all, the Saudi crown prince needs to strengthen his political position at home and he views Russia as an actor that can help him achieve this goal. When Mohammed bin Salman initiated the " Vision 2030 " reforms, he signalled a change in the traditional way of life in Saudi Arabia and an exit from the country's economic "comfort zone". By doing this, the young crown prince risked alienating not only the Muslim clergy and the Saudi elites, but also broad sections of the Saudi population, who feared that they would bear the costs of these unpopular economic reforms. Therefore, securing a painless transfer of power from King Salman to his son, Mohammad bin Salman, is a key issue for the kingdom at this point in time. King Salman's authority is respected among the members of the dynasty, but it is hard to make the same claim for the crown prince, who built his political career on striking not fully established or accepted rules and reforms. As a result, the crown prince desperately needs foreign policy victories to win domestic support. So far, he failed to achieve this in the war in Yemen or in the confrontation with Qatar , but he is now hoping to show his diplomatic talent by increasing the kingdom's cooperation with Moscow. OPINION: Russia and the GCC crisis Undoubtedly King Salman and Vladimir Putin will be discussing the conflict in Syria during their meeting in Moscow. Russia has repeatedly stated that it highly appreciates the role Saudi Arabia played in the signing of the Cairo agreements which foresaw the establishment of a full ceasefire in Eastern Ghouta. In this regard, it is likely that at the end of this meeting, Riyadh will be able to convince Moscow to guarantee seats for opposition representatives loyal to Saudi Arabia in the future Syrian government. Such a guarantee would help the crown prince to strengthen his diplomatic credentials at home. Yemen, where Saudi Arabia still counts on Moscow's loyalty, is no less important for Muhammad bin Salman. Since the beginning of the Saudi military operation in Yemen in March 2015, the Russian leadership has tried to refrain from categorical comments on Yemen, supporting, de facto, the efforts undertaken by Riyadh. It is now being argued that, following the meeting in Moscow, the Russian leadership will confirm its intention not to prevent the Saudis from taking further steps in resolving the Yemeni conflict, once again helping the crown prince to claim a foreign policy victory. Moscow's financial interests In turn, Moscow is interested in strengthening the financial component of Russian-Saudi relations. The Russian leadership has repeatedly expressed its dissatisfaction with the fact that most of the agreements affecting economic, as well as military-technical cooperation remain at the Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) level. The only exception to this rule is the agreement reached within the framework of OPEC on the reduction of oil production and stabilisation of oil prices . In Moscow, it is expected that King Salman's visit will put an end to the era of non-committal agreements.The parties are expected to sign the first contract for the supply of Russian arms to Saudi Arabia. The general terms of this $3.5bn contract were agreed upon this summer. Another project in which the Russian authorities are interested, maybe the participation of Russia's Rosneft in the partial privatisation of the Saudi Aramco, which was announced to take place in 2018. King Salman's Moscow visit may also mark a turning point for the desired influx of Saudi investment into Russia. This summer, the Saudi ambassador to Russia, Ibrahim al-Rassi, visited a number of North Caucasian republics, where he assessed their investment attractiveness for the kingdom. Moreover, it is expected that the Saudi Public Investment Fund would launch its representative office in Russia following the results of the meeting. Howbeit, Russia and Saudi Arabia are beginning to value relations with each other more, preferring pragmatic cooperation to costs from ideological confrontation.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabi''s King Salman attend a welcoming ceremony before their talks at the Kremlin in Moscow on October 5 [Reuters/Yuri Kadobnov] Last week, Saudi King Salman was greeted in Moscow with a lot of pomp and media attention. The 81-year-old monarch arrived with a 1,500-strong delegation amid high expectations for major political and trade deals. The first visit of a Saudi king to Russia was rich in diplomatic courtesies, but it lacked in substance. What came out of the three days of meetings was much more modest than expected. The two countries signed only a handful of agreements, most of which were memoranda of understanding. An agreement was reached to establish a $1bn energy investment fund and a $1bn hi-tech investment fund. The two sides also negotiated the sale of S-400 defence systems. But against the backdrop of the $15bn-worth of arms contracts the US recently approved for Saudi Arabia , the Moscow-Riyadh agreement seems quite modest. It very much seems like the high-level meetings in the Kremlin failed to create an appearance of a political and economic breakthrough in relations. This shouldn't be all that surprising given that Russia and Saudi Arabia had a 54-year break in relations, during which the US became Riyadh's dominant partner and security guarantor. Perhaps the outcome of King Salman's visit could have been very different, if it weren't for an incident that spoiled Russian-Saudi relations 80 years ago and caused the break. It is a little-known fact that Riyadh and Moscow used to enjoy remarkably warm relations in the 1920s and 30s. The Soviet Union was, in fact, a diplomatic pioneer in Saudi Arabia: It was the first state to recognise Abdulaziz Al Saud (King Salman's father) as the King of the Hijaz and the Sultan of Nejd in February 1926. King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud in 1930 [AP] The Soviet charm offensive in the Arabian Peninsula in the 1920s was the culmination of numerous attempts by Moscow to gain a foothold in the region prior to that. As early as 1900, Russian imperial military vessels started frequenting the Gulf and making port calls in Kuwait among other destinations. The famous Russian Varyag cruiser visited Kuwait in December 1901 and its captain was greeted by Emir Mubarak Al Sabah despite his agreement with Great Britain not to receive foreign military guests. It was during this visit that the Russians were first introduced to Abdul Rahman Al Saud who was exiled in Kuwait at that time, along with his elder son Abdulaziz, who a year later retook Riaydh from their rivals, the House of Rashid. As the House of Al Saud was seeking international backing, London looked at young Abdulaziz with a lot of scepticism, which is why he came in contact with the Russian consul in the Persian city of Bushehr inviting him for a visit. The consul visited Kuwait in 1903 accompanied by a Russian military vessel, which caused an outcry in London. But it wasn't until after the Bolshevik revolution that Moscow decided to seriously focus on the Gulf. Just like the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union saw the value of diplomatic presence in the region as a way to stand up to Britain. Apart from pursuing relations with the House of Al Saud, the Soviet Union looked at the Kingdom of Hejaz whose ruler Sharif Hussein controlled Mecca and Medina as a way to reach out to the entire Muslim world. Being at odds with London, Hussein was on the lookout for strong foreign allies, which is why his representative in Rome engaged in talks with the Soviets. Karim Hakimov in traditional Arab dress [Wikipedia] Extensive diplomatic communication between Georgy Chicherin, the Soviet People's commissar for foreign affairs, and Soviet diplomats reveals just how important his vision of the Arabian Peninsula and its role in the Muslim world was. Advocating the appointment of a Soviet Muslim as envoy to Hejaz, Chicherin noted in his memo to Joseph Stalin that "Getting into Mecca is of crucial importance to us because it would increase our influence in Arabia and beyond." He recognised that the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, the Hajj, was a perfect opportunity to reach out to thousands of Muslims from the British and French colonies and flare up anti-colonial sentiment. In August 1924, Soviet Consul General Karim Khakimov, a Soviet Muslim of Tatar descent, arrived in Jeddah. Soon after Khakimov's arrival in Jeddah, Abdulaziz launched his campaign to take over Hejaz, which left newly arrived Soviet diplomats with a dilemma of whom to side with. Diplomatic dispatches from the Soviet commissar for foreign affairs ordered Khakimov to position himself as an ally of all Arabs without openly showing a preference for either side. "If Ibn Saud pursues a policy of uniting the Arabs, this will be in our interests, and we will also have to try to get closer to him, as we did with respect to Hussein, who tried to unite Arabia," Chicherin wrote to Khakimov. The Soviet Union saw the unification of Arabs as the first step towards empowering Muslims in the region and undermining British rule over them. By December 1924, Abdelaziz took Mecca and Khakimov was convinced that the time was right for him to try to introduce himself to Ibn Saud. In April 1925, when Jeddah was under siege, he was allowed to perform Umrah, a pilgrimage to Mecca, where Ibn Saud was based, thus getting a chance to meet him - something that no Western non-Muslim diplomat had been allowed to do. Khakimov's letters to Moscow reveal that his meeting with Abdulaziz went exceptionally well and that even his idea of Soviet mediation between Hejaz and Nejd was perceived positively by Ibn Saud. By the end of 1925, Ibn Saud controlled Jeddah, and in February 1926 he declared himself King of Hejaz and Sultan of Nejd. As soon as the Soviet mission learned the news, Khakimov did what ultimately earned him the respect and friendship of Ibn Saud. On February 16, Karim Khakimov drove his personal car mounted with a Soviet flag through gunfire from Jeddah to Ibn Saud's residence in the desert to hand over a formal note recognising his status as the king. The Soviet Union was the first state to recognise his new title. Abdulaziz responded with a letter thanking the Soviet Union for its neutrality during the war with Hussein and expressed readiness for "relations with the government of the USSR and its citizens". Soviet-Saudi relations improved further when the Pan-Islamic Congress of Mecca was called in June 1926, whose objective was to resolve the dispute over Mecca and Medina. At the time, Ibn Saud's control over these holy sights had many opponents among Islamic notables, which is why it was paramount for the king to earn recognition at the congress. Karim Khakimov and Emir Faisal in Moscow in 1932 [Wikipedia] Realising this, the Soviet Union did what contradicted the fundamentals of its atheistic ideology: it sent six Soviet Islamic scholars to take part in the congress. Moscow with its 30 million Soviet Muslims threw its weight behind King Abdulaziz, providing the votes for him to be elected the president of the congress. What is more, as a result of Khakimov's efforts, a Soviet delegate was elected the vice-president of the conference. Having established full diplomatic relations with King Abdulaziz, the Soviet Union dispatched, in 1928, a new head of mission to the kingdom, Nazir Bey Turyakulov. London's key concern about the Soviet influence in Jeddah was that it was spreading Communist propaganda among Muslims during the Hajj. Indeed, this was one of the ideas that Moscow had for its diplomats in Jeddah, but in reality, the Soviet mission had a hard time reaching out to both locals and pilgrims. Faced with a lot of resistance, Soviet diplomats decided to focus on the creation of trade links between Soviet Black Sea ports and Hejaz. Khakimov managed to convince King Abdulaziz to lift restrictions against Soviet goods that existed in the kingdom due to London's lobbying. In 1929-1930, Soviet goods poured into the kingdom from the port city of Odessa. The biggest achievement of Soviet diplomats in Jeddah was entering the kerosene and benzine market that was almost entirely dominated by the British. The Soviet Union also sent a group of medics to the kingdom to take care of pilgrims during the Hajj. As a result of Khakimov's efforts to further develop his ties with Ibn Saud, his son Prince Faisal (who became king in 1969) visited the Soviet Union during his extensive European trip in 1932. Moscow went out of its way to impress Faisal and his entourage by introducing them to the achievements of the Soviet industry, forgiving the Saudi debt that had accumulated by then and, most importantly, offering one million British pounds in financial aid that King Abdulaziz badly needed. While visiting Soviet Azerbaijan, what was going through an oil boom of its own, Prince Faisal was impressed with the country's oil industry expressing a desire to employ the same technology in the kingdom. King Faisal meets US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Riyadh on March 19, 1975 [AP] The 1932 visit to the Soviet Union was the highlight of the Saudi-Soviet relations. King Abdulaziz used Moscow's offer of financial aid to push London to provide aid and never accepted the USSR's offer. From that point on, the relations between the two states stagnated. As the power of Joseph Stalin was growing stronger, the relationship between the communist regime and Islam was becoming uneasy. In 1932, the Soviet Union unofficially banned its Muslims from performing Hajj. Soviet medics continued to work in the kingdom and the diplomatic mission continued to function spreading Soviet propaganda among Saudis. In 1937, the wife of the Soviet consul, a doctor herself, even stayed with the favourite wife of Prince Faisal for several months. After spending a few years in Yemen and Moscow, Karim Khakimov returned to Jeddah as the Head of Mission in 1935, hoping to revitalise the relationship that during his absence gradually came to a halt. Khakimov tried negotiating new trade contracts with the king, but Moscow was no longer interested. It was the time when Hitler was growing stronger in Europe and Stalin, who was sceptical about the USSR's presence in the Gulf from the beginning, no longer saw the partnership with King Abdulaziz as beneficial. In fact, dropping any political ambitions for the Gulf was a gesture that Moscow thought would help it partner with England, whose support the Soviet Union sought against Hitler. The career of the Soviet Lawrence of Arabia ended abruptly when he fell victim to Stalin's political terror in 1937. In September that year, he was recalled to Moscow for a routine visit to the foreign ministry, but upon his arrival, he was arrested on suspicion of being a spy. His colleague Turyakulov who worked with him on the Saudi file was executed in October 1937. Khakimov was executed in January 1938. King Abdulaziz was outraged at the news that the two Soviet diplomats whom he considered his friends were killed. Two months after Khakimov was executed in Moscow, American geologists discovered the world's largest deposits of crude oil in Dhahran. This prompted the Soviet Union to appoint a new head of mission in Jeddah in 1938. King Abdulaziz, however, turned the appointment down saying that he does not wish to see anyone other than Khakimov or Turyakulov in Jeddah. He accused Moscow of inciting a revolution in the Muslim world and broke diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union. In September 1938, all remaining Soviet diplomats left Jeddah and the mission was shut down. With the USSR eliminated as a rival, Britain and later the US took over the development and exploitation of Saudi oil.

A real advance in the project of empowering Muslim women and recognising their right to equality can never come from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, writes Zakaria [Susan Baaghil/Reuters] The royal decree came on a Tuesday during the month of Muharram, while many of the world's Muslims were mourning . Announced simultaneously on Saudi state television and via a live media event in Washington, DC, King Salman's directive granted Saudi women, eternal passengers until now, the freedom to drive. They would be able to apply for and obtain driver's licenses, and when they had them, they could drive around the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia without the presence of a male guardian. The news, eagerly disseminated via Twitter, engendered great jubilation just about everywhere. "This is a huge step for us," one Saudi woman breathlessly exclaimed; the lifting of the ban was not just about driving, she gushed, it was a metaphor for Saudi women taking control of their own lives. Western women lavished their congratulations, their public praise underscoring a covert recognition of their own advanced freedoms; their luck at not being born in Saudi Arabia. READ MORE: Saudi women driving ban lifted - Euphoria and sarcasm It is no surprise that the driving decree was greeted with such profuse praise. The world loves simple solutions and here was a particularly appealing one, basic and binary, black and white, easy to applaud. Now that Saudi women could drive it suggested; a constricted society, proudly patriarchal until now, had been transformed into the venue for a feminist victory.

The Saudis did just that this past Tuesday, utilising the simplicity of the driving-as-freedom metaphor as a front to distract from the real complications of faith and gender and long-denied equality. The proof is in the pronouncement itself, its glib grant of the freedom to "drive" without a male guardian covering up its smug silence on the larger issue of guardian-free travel itself. The detail is just the sort to be overlooked by all those unfamiliar with the whims and fiats of the Kingdom, an oversight the architects of this Tuesday's ban-lifting spectacle were counting on. The grant of an almost freedom thus stood in for a promise of actual change or any real recognition of equality. A real advance in the project of empowering Muslim women and recognising their right to equality can never come from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The reason is simple: championing as it does literalist and de-contextualised readings of Islamic holy texts, the Kingdom and its clerics will never support the teachings of Muslim feminists who are pushing for just that. These women, who include scholars such as Dr Amina Wadud and Dr Asma Barlas among others, have used textual analysis of Muslim religious sources to argue that the Holy Quran enshrines gender equality as a central tenet of faith. Barlas, author of "Believing Women in Islam," shows how only six out of six thousand verses in the Holy Quran have been used by male scholars to impose male-dominated readings on Muslim women. It is just these sorts of male-dominated readings, intent as they are on discounting the patriarchal context of the men who first produced them, that are the mainstay of the Saudi understanding of gender, their insistence that gender equality is antithetical rather than inherent to Islam. READ MORE: Saudi Arabia should stop 'bloody execution spree' Saudi intransigence towards Muslim feminism and the project of recognising gender equality could be ignored were it not for the fact that the Kingdom and its scholars claim the provenance of defining true Islam for the rest of the Muslim world. It is on just this basis that they insisted the driving ban (and all other restrictions on women's autonomy and leadership) was grounded in Islamic teachings. Driving may be off the list of forbidden acts for females, but everything else remains on it. The intrigues of strategic manoeuvring should not detract from the truth that the Kingdom's orientation towards the position of women within Islam is diametrically opposed to those who are pushing for a gender-egalitarian understanding of Islam. The lifting of the Saudi driving ban is not motivated out of concern for women's rights but rather strategic interest. The story proceeds thus; for as long as it served their purposes, the Al Saud monarchs of old refused to budge in their insistence that women could not be permitted to drive. Then came the pressing prerogatives of the present moment; the lifting of the driving ban now had the potential to be just the feel-good smokescreen that could detract from more noxious issues such as the suppression of dissent within the Kingdom and the slaughter of Yemeni civilians just beyond it. In the interest of rescuing brand Saudi Arabia, a shred of misogyny was thus sacrificed; that the lifting of the ban was telecast not only in the Kingdom but also via a live media event in DC explains all the rest The intrigues of strategic manoeuvring, however, should not detract from the truth that the Kingdom's orientation towards the position of women within Islam is diametrically opposed to those who are pushing for a gender-egalitarian understanding of Islam. In still insisting that women can never lead, must beg guardians for permission to travel, to open a bank account, to enroll in university, must be subservient to husbands, to fathers and even to sons, Saudi clerics deny outright any possibility of equality between the sexes, discarding the precept as a foreign imposition. Viewed under this overarching lens, the lifting of the driving ban is best understood as an allowance of convenience, instituted not because it is likely to have wide and far-reaching implications, but precisely because it will have few or none. The reality of Saudi Arabia substantiates this reading; a majority of Saudi women (none of the kingdoms millions of migrant workers are included in this designation) are able and willing to afford chauffeurs, and driving for many will be a matter of sport or spectacle, an opportunity to have his and hers editions of fancy new cars. Jaguar and Cadillac know this and have already begun advertising to them. The precept that the lifting of Saudi Arabia's driving ban suggests a new and different future for Muslim women disregards the work of Muslim feminists who have actually been working towards this goal. Jubilation at the lifting of an arbitrary edict, an example of how the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has used Islam to cover up its misogyny, is to recognise the legitimacy of the use of faith as a cover-up for laws and edicts that have nothing at all to do with it. Muslim women can do better than that; Muslim women are doing better than that. As long as the rights of millions of Muslim women remain subject to the whims of male monarchs, driving around is at best a fake freedom.

"Our sovereignty is a red line. We don't accept anybody interfering our sovereignty," Sheikh Tamim told US television programme 60 Minutes. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain cut ties with Qatar on June 5 and imposed a land, sea and air embargo, accusing it of supporting "terrorism". Doha has repeatedly denied the allegation. "They don't like our independence, the way how we are thinking, our vision for the region," he told host Charlie Rose in a wide-ranging interview that aired on Sunday. "We want freedom of speech for the people of the region and they're not happy with that, and so they think that this is a threat to them." When people took to the streets across the Middle East and North Africa in protests that would become known as the Arab spring, Qatar "stood by the people," Sheikh Tamim said. "The difference between us and them during the Arab Spring is that we stood by the people. They stood by the regimes. "I feel that we chose the right side when we stood by the people." 'It was a shock' The months-long diplomatic dispute began about two weeks after a late May Arab-Islamic-American summit in Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh, which was attended by US President Donald Trump and representatives of 55 Arab and Muslim-dominated countries. Among them was both the Qatari emir and the leaders of the countries that subsequently blockaded Qatar.

"It was a shock," said Sheikh Tamim, referring to the blockade. "A few weeks before that, we were meeting, all of us together, in one room, including President Trump," he told CBS News' 60 Minutes. "We were discussing terrorism, financing terrorism, and nobody brought any concern from those countries. Nobody told me anything." When asked about the presence of Taliban in Qatar, Sheikh Tamim said that they were asked and allowed to set up offices in the Qatari capital of Doha at the request of the United States . "The reason why they came here, it's not because we asked them to come," he told 60 Minutes. "America asked … They wanted to have dialogue so they asked us if we can host them here and have the dialogue. So we hosted them here, this is the reason why they're here," added Sheikh Thamim. "When they [blockading countries] talk about terrorism, absolutely not. We do not support terrorism." Al Jazeera's Mike Hanna, reporting from Washington, DC, said that this was the " first public statement from the emir since this crisis began back in June. "He made it very clear his belief that the charges by the other Gulf states and Egypt are completely baseless ... and rejected out of hand the claims by the boycotting states that Qatar is backing terrorism in any form," added Hanna. 'We want it to end' In the interview, the emir also said he is willing to attend US-hosted direct talks to put an and to the diplomatic crisis, but added that he has yet to hear a response to Trump's offer to hold a meeting at his retreat in Camp David.

If they going to walk one metre toward me, I'm willing to walk 10,000 miles towards them." On June 22, the quartet issued a 13-point list of demands, including the shutdown of Qatar-based media network Al Jazeera, limiting ties with Iran, and expelling Turkish troops stationed in the country as a prerequisite to lifting the blockade. Doha rejected all the demands, denouncing them as attempts to infringe Qatar's sovereignty. During the interview, the Qatari emir reiterated that the fate of Al Jazeera, which was launched in 1996, was not up for discussion. "We're not going to shut down Al Jazeera," he said. {articleGUID} "When you tell me to close a channel like Al Jazeera, history will write one day in 50, 60 or 70 years how it changed the whole idea of free speech in the region."

It was "obvious" that the Saudi-led quartet is trying to force a change of leadership in Qatar, Sheikh Tamim said. "History as well tells us, teaches us, they tried to do that before, in 1996 after my father became the emir." Sheikh Tamim became emir in 2013 at the age of 33, after his father, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, transferred power to him. The 60 Minutes interview took place in Doha in early October, shortly after the emir's return to the country after his first foreign trip since the start of the crisis. In a major show of unity, thousands lined up the streets of Doha to welcome back Sheikh Tamim following the trips to Europe and the United General Assembly in New York, where he denounced the "unjust siege" imposed on Qatar. When asked by Rose if he thought that the Saudi-led group had underestimated him, Sheikh Tamim replied: "I think they underestimated the Qatari people. I'm so proud of the people."

Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi meets Saudi King Salman in Jeddah in June [Saudi Press Agency via AP] A recent warming of ties between Saudi Arabia and Iraq could signal a move away from Iran's influence over Baghdad, analysts say, but with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi arriving on Wednesday in Tehran, that remains to be seen. On Sunday, Saudi Arabia and Iraq inaugurated a coordination committee and signed a number of agreements. The developments come after years of tension between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Al-Abadi visited Riyadh for the second time in four months, as part of a regional tour that also included stops in Egypt and Jordan. In a statement addressing the inauguration of the committee, King Salman of Saudi Arabia said the body presents the two countries with a "historic opportunity to build an effective partnership to achieve common aspirations". The coordination committee includes a range of political, security, economic, trade and development deals. As part of the agreements, Saudi Arabia will open a consulate in Iraq, relaunch airline flights between the two countries, open the border, and jointly develop ports and highways. The two nations also agreed to allow Saudi investment in Iraq, study a trade exchange area, and review customs cooperation agreements. For his part, al-Abadi expressed his optimism and "deep satisfaction" with the recent developments between the neighbouring countries. {articleGUID} What has changed? Since the fall of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's government in 2003 during the US-led invasion , Iran has advanced its influence in Baghdad. Iran has helped Iraq in the fight against ISIL (also known as ISIS) while supporting powerful Shia militias in the country. The fallout in Saudi-Iraqi relations began after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Following the demise of Hussein's regime, incoming Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's administration in Baghdad did not offer much optimism to solve the myriad of post-war problems. Since 1990, Saudi Arabia has had its embassy in Iraq shut down and borders closed. However, the first signs of easing tensions between the two countries started in 2015 when Saudi Arabia reopened its embassy in Iraq. In February, Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, visited Baghdad marking the first visit by a Saudi foreign minister to the Iraqi capital in almost 27 years. "Abadi's tenure has contrasted somewhat starkly with that of Maliki, who was a much more divisive figure, populist, and sectarian in his outlook and rhetoric," Ranj Alaaldin, a visiting fellow at Brookings Doha Center, told Al Jazeera . "Since the arrival of Abadi, Iraq has been presented with an opportunity to open a new chapter with the region." {articleGUID} Iran challenged With Iraqi elections coming up less than a year from now, Saudi Arabia is attempting to establish new alliances in Iraq to ensure its interests and relations with Baghdad remain secure, according to analysts. One of the goals is to "sideline and challenge Iran's alliances in Baghdad", Alaaldin said. "The US backs Abadi and sees him as a counterweight against Iran-alliances - including Maliki and Shia militia groups that aligned with Iran," he said. Another common interest between Saudi Arabia and al-Abadi's government is to "reconstruct and rehabilitate Arab Sunni cities in northern Iraq - financially and politically", Alaaldin said, in order to enhance Arab-Sunni political participation with elections around the corner. In July, Iraq's nationalist Shia leader Muqtada al-Sadr made a surprise visit to Saudi Arabia's Jeddah, where he met Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 'Balanced approach' How effective the Saudis can be in containing Iran's influence in Iraq remains unclear. Marwan Kabalan, an associate political analyst at the Doha Institute, said it is unknown if the Saudis can succeed "given their poor foreign policy performance vis-a-vis Iran". Al-Abadi will maintain a "balanced" approach in his regional relations, he said, with the Iraqi prime minister arriving in Tehran for talks on Thursday. "[al-Abadi] would most probably assure the Iranians that his visit to Saudi Arabia is not against them," Kabalan told Al Jazeera. "All he is trying to do is to invite much [needed] investment money to rebuild Iraq's destroyed cities, something the Iranians cannot offer. This is important especially for his Shia base of support, which is very sceptical about Saudi Arabia."

On June 5, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a land, air and sea blockade on their Gulf neighbour, accusing it of financing "terrorism" and maintaining too close of ties to their regional rival, Iran . Doha denies the allegations. {articleGUID} While in the kingdom, the inaugural Coordination Council meeting between the governments of Saudi Arabia and Iraq will also be on Tillerson's agenda. After Riyadh, the secretary of state is due to travel to Qatar's capital, Doha, on Sunday, where he will meet Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. Tillerson offered little optimism about a solution to the Gulf crisis in advance of his Middle East tour, blaming the Saudi-led group of countries for the lack of progress. "I do not have a lot of expectations for it being resolved anytime soon," he said in an interview with financial news agency Bloomberg on Thursday. "There seems to be a real unwillingness on the part of some of the parties to want to engage ... It's up to the leadership of the quartet when they want to engage with Qatar because Qatar has been very clear - they're ready to engage," added Tillerson. Marwan Bishara, Al Jazeera's senior political analyst, said the Qatar crisis "is becoming an embarrassing topic" for Saudi Arabia and the UAE "simply because Washington has already moved on". "It's no longer taking their arguments seriously and the whole bit about Qatar supporting terrorism and instability in the region is, of course, proving false," Bishara added. "Clearly, Tillerson has other bigger issues in mind, especially the containment of Iran, and reckons the Qatar crisis is simply a distraction and counterproductive of the overall policy that the US is seeking in the region." 'Renewed hope' Tillerson last visited the Gulf states in July. Despite an intense round of shuttle diplomacy that also took him to Kuwait , which has led the mediation efforts, tensions have remained high between the Gulf neighbours. {articleGUID} "He tried before, he tried to be nice with everyone but this took him nowhere and produced no results so I think he has probably realised that the time has come to use some leverage," Ibrahim Fraihat, foreign policy expert at the Center for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies in Doha, said. Analysts say there is renewed hope the blockading countries might be more willing to engage this time around. "The president [Donald Trump], for example, has tried to put pressure on the Saudis and the UAE to be willing to meet to resolve some of the sanctions that they put on Qatar," Lawrence Korb, senior fellow at the Centre for American Progress, told Al Jazeera. Korb also cited Trump's recent push to decertify the Iran nuclear agreement as a factor that could make Saudi Arabia more willing to "work with the US to deal with the situation with Qatar". After the stops in the Middle East, Tillerson will go to Pakistan and India, and then to Switzerland on his way back to the US.

Sam Walton, a Quaker activist, and Daniel Woodhouse, a Methodist minister from Leeds, are facing charges of criminal damage [Courtesy of Sam Walton] Two British activists could face jail terms of up to 10 years after attempting to "disarm" BAE fighter jets heading to Saudi Arabia , where they would have been used to support the kingdom's ongoing bombing campaign in Yemen . Sam Walton, a Quaker activist, and Daniel Woodhouse, a Methodist minister, were arrested in January after breaking into a BAE Systems airbase in Warton, Lancashire, with hammers and crowbars as they tried to "prevent a war crime" in the Arabian Peninsula state. The pair managed to get beyond fences, closed doors and CCTV camera at the site, which they claim was housing 13 fighter jets scheduled to be sent to Saudi Arabia. "We brought a hammer and a crowbar and were intending on disarming the jets by hammering their noses, which houses the radars, as well as the side panels and the cockpits," Walton told Al Jazeera. "We got within five feet of them ... but as we started to go at a door with our crowbars, we alerted security, and they found us." {articleGUID} PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Walton said the duo were scheduled to appear at Burnley Magistrates Court on Tuesday on charges of criminal damage and could face up to 10 years in prison. The duo entered the base 21 years after four women - known as the Ploughshare Four - caused more than 1.5 million pounds ($2m) in damage to a Hawk fighter jet destined for Indonesia . The women argued the jet would likely be used to kill civilians in East Timor and were later found not guilty of criminal damage under the Genocide Act. "This could have been one of the largest conspiracies to commit criminal charges cases in UK legal history," Walton said. "There was close to a $1bn worth of planes in that hanger, but we've been charged with 1,000 pounds (around $1,300) worth of damage - a mickey-mouse offence - because BAE wants this case to go away." BAE did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment on the case. Since Saudi Arabia launched its military intervention in Yemen, UK weapons companies, including BAE systems and Raytheon, have earned revenues exceeding $8bn, generating profits estimated at almost $775m. 'Conflict as a business opportunity' The UK has approved sales of the Tornado aircraft, which is partially manufactured by BAE systems; BAE's Tactica armoured vehicles, valued at $580,000; vehicles and tanks; and $1.48bn worth of grenades, missiles and bombs. Andrew Smith, a spokesperson for the Campaign Against Arms Trade, told Al Jazeera that the "real crime" was the UK government's decision to keep arming and supporting Saudi Arabia. "While aid organisations have done everything they can to help the people of Yemen, BAE has seen the conflict as a business opportunity and a means to sell more fighter jets," Smith said. "What Sam and Daniel did was to try and stop those jets, something they should have never had to do in the first place. The government should have done that." The war in Yemen has killed more than 10,000 people and injured more than 40,000 to date, according to the United Nations . The country is also facing a deadly cholera outbreak, a direct consequence of the war, that has claimed about 2,000 lives and affected more than 500,000 people since late April. "The UK can't continue building its economy on the bodies of the innocent," Walton said. SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Saudi Arabia Yemen Middle East War & Conflict

Trump's comments to the press echoed his tweet earlier on Saturday, which said: "Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange. Important to the United States!" Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange. Important to the United States! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 4, 2017 Aramco is the world's largest company in the oil business and the backbone of the Saudi economy. The Aramco IPO deal is at the heart of an ambitious economic reform programme, Saudi Vision 2030, which aims to reduce the country's reliance on oil. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman shrugged off speculations of shelving the IPO last month, telling Reuters news agency that the deal was on track for 2018 and could value the company at some $2 trillion. Saudi shake-up On Saturday, Saudi Arabia dismissed a number of senior ministers and detained nearly a dozen princes in an investigation by a new anti-corruption committee, state media reported. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a billionaire businessman who owns investment firm Kingdom Holding, was among those held, according to Reuters news agency, citing an unnamed senior official. The senior ministers who were dismissed include Prince Meteb bin Abdullah, the head of the National Guard, and Adel Fakeih, the economy minister. {articleGUID} Abdullah al-Sultan, commander of the Saudi navy, was replaced by Fahad al-Ghafli. In a statement on the official Saudi news agency SPA, King Salman alluded to the "exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to illicitly accrue money" for the creation of the anti-graft committee.

More than 10,000 Yemenis have been killed since Saudi Arabia intervened in the country's war [Courtesy of Al Masirah] At least 29 Yemeni civilians have been killed after a Saudi-led air strike "decimated" a busy market in the impoverished north of the country, witnesses and rebel media say. Local residents told Al Jazeera the raid targeted the Alaf market in the northern province of Saada shortly after midnight on Wednesday, killing 29 men and wounding at least nine others as they slept. Rescue workers were continuing to search for seven missing people late into the evening, but videos from the scene showed the area completely destroyed by the attack with fires still burning from the charred frames of the shops. The bodies of the victims, many of their faces disfigured beyond recognition, were laid out on white body bags for families to identify in the courtyard of a hospital morgue. Anything that moves is at the threat of being bombed. Nowhere is safe from these criminals. Abdulrahman, local resident Al Masirah, a TV channel run by the Houthis - a group of rebels who control Saada province, the capital Sanaa, as well as other parts of central Yemen - confirmed the death toll. Abdulrahman, who declined to give his surname, said there were no Houthi fighters in the area when the attack happened. "The air strike completely decimated the market," he told Al Jazeera. "Because of repeated air strikes and mortar fire from the Saudi border, many Yemeni workers have resorted to sleeping in their shops as it's too dangerous to be on the roads at night. "Anything that moves is at the threat of being bombed," he added. "Nowhere is safe from these criminals." A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition did not respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment. {articleGUID} Saada, a Houthi stronghold, has been repeatedly targeted by Saudi-led aerial bombardment since a coalition of Arab states joined the war in March 2015. "We are deeply saddened to hear of the reports coming from Saada today and our UN partners are verifying the incident," Shabia Mantoo, a spokesperson for the UN's refugee agency in Yemen (UNHCR), told Al Jazeera. "With the conflict prolonging in Yemen, we are seeing hostilities intensify, humanitarian needs accumulate and civilians bearing the brunt." The war in Yemen, the Arab region's poorest country, started in 2014 after Houthi fighters seized control of Sanaa and began pushing south towards the country's third-biggest city, Aden. Concerned by the rise of the Houthis, believed to be backed by regional rival Iran , Saudi Arabia and a coalition of Sunni Arab states launched an intervention in 2015 in the form of a massive air campaign aimed at reinstalling President Adb-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government. According to the United Nations , the number of air raids per month is now three times higher than last year, and monthly reports of armed clashes are up 50 percent. More than 10,000 people have been killed and at least 40,000 wounded, mostly from Saudi-led air strikes. The Saudi-led air campaign and subsequent land, air and naval blockade have created a humanitarian disaster. Cholera is on the rise and nearly 70 percent of the population is dependent on aid. "A peaceful political solution is required more than ever to protect civilian life and to mitigate suffering," Mantoo said.

RenderPagesVideo('5635970654001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Saudi Arabia has dismissed a number of senior ministers and detained nearly a dozen princes in an investigation by a new anti-corruption committee, state media reported on Saturday. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a billionaire businessman who owns investment firm Kingdom Holding, was among those held, according to Reuters news agency, citing an unnamed senior official. The senior ministers who were sacked include Prince Mitaab bin Abdullah, the head of the National Guard, and Adel Faqih, the economy minister. Abdullah al-Sultan, commander of the Saudi navy, was replaced by Fahad al-Ghafli. In a statement on the official Saudi news agency, SPA , King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud alluded to the "exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money" for the creation of the anti-graft committee. Anti-corruption probe Saudi-owned Al Arabiya news channel reported that at least 11 princes, four current ministers and several former ministers had been detained in the anti-corruption probe. Saudi officials, businessmen reportedly detained: Alwaleed bin Talal, owner of Kingdom Holding group Prince Mitaab bin Abdullah, minister of the National Guard Prince Turki bin Abdullah, former governor of Riyadh Prince Turki bin Nasser, former head of meteorology, environment Waleed al-Ibrahim, chairman of MBC media group Khaled al-Tuwaijri, former president of the Royal Court Adel Faqih, minister of economy and planning Amr al-Dabbagh, former president of the General Investment Authority Saleh Abdullah Kamel, chairman of Dallah al Baraka Group Saud al-Tobaishi, head of Royal ceremonies and protocols Ibrahim al-Assaf, state minister and executive of Saudi Aramco Bakr Binladin, owner of construction company Saudi Binladin Group Saud al-Dawish, former CEO of Saudi Telecom Company Khaled al-Mulhem, former director general of Saudi Arabian Airlines Saudi authorities have not confirmed the names of those detained. However, 14 former and current ministers, officials and businessmen were mentioned on social media as being among those held. One of those mentioned is Waleed Ibrahim, the chairman of the Middle East Broadcasting Center (MBC), under which Al Arabiya operates. According to Al Arabiya, the new committee, which is headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is looking into the 2009 floods that devastated parts of Jeddah, as well as the government's response to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus outbreak . King Salman issued a statement saying that the committee shall "identify offences, crimes and persons and entities involved in cases of public corruption". The committee has the power to issue arrest warrants, travel bans, disclose and freeze accounts and portfolios, track funds and assets, and "prevent their remittance or transfer by persons and entities, whatever they might be", according to the statement. 'Accelerated change' The shake-up of the Saudi government comes just months after King Salman replaced his nephew Mohammed bin Nayef with his son Mohammed bin Salman as the kingdom's crown prince . Mohammed bin Salman has been responsible for pushing through a number of changes both at home and abroad since he became first in line to the Saudi crown. Ian Black of the London School of Economics said the move fit a "pattern of accelerated change" since Mohammed bin Salman became heir. "We've seen since June this year, very far-reaching changes," he said, adding: "That was when Mohammed bin Salman, the son of King Salman, was appointed crown prince. "Since Mohammed bin Salman became the crown prince in June, we've seen a lot of upheaval. We've seen the announcement of this very ambitious Saudi plan to transform the country the Saudi economy, Vision 2030." The dismissal of Mitaab bin Abdullah as National Guard minister came shortly after a missile attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels on Riyadh's King Khaled International Airport. However, Black said the two were probably not related as the sacking came bundled with changes to other ministerial portfolios. In recent weeks, Saudi Arabia has announced an end to its long-standing ban on allowing women to drive, and Mohammed bin Salman has also promised to return the country to a "moderate" form of Islam. Since 2015 Saudi Arabia has been at war against Houthi rebels , who control much of northern Yemen on the kingdom's southern border. What does this mean? Al Jazeera's senior political analyst Marwan Bishara explains: "There have been signs over the last two and a half years that more of this is coming. [Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman] is raising the leverage of power in Saudi Arabia. He certainly has the blessings of his father King Salman and he's determined to make all kinds of changes in Saudi Arabia itself and in Saudi foreign policy, which led to the war in Yemen and the Gulf crisis. But internally this is new. Not only do we have a new chapter opening up in Saudi Arabia, we have a whole new book, a whole new political alphabet with one exception: it's still all done in secrecy. Why those 11 princes, why those four standing ministers? Is it really just to consolidate power or is there more to it? Why isn't there more transparency and sharing of evidence about the setting up of the committee? We really are on the brink of dramatic changes. In 2015, Mohammed bin Salman became minster of defence. Just a few months ago, he became the head of all the internal security forces because they got rid of the Mohammed bin Nayef, then crown prince. Now he's taken control of the third most important security apparatus within the country, so he has defence, he is in control of interior and now he is in control of the guards. Clearly he has the stage set. Clearly all the heads of all the major media networks, newspapers, and commentators were all already groomed, set in motion in order to defend the crown prince and his policies. There are already new songs for the crown prince and his glory, so internally they are definitely setting the stage in terms of the three security apparatuses, the media and so on. President Trump has given his blessings and support to the crown prince with the hundreds of billions of dollars of promised contracts, so he's certainly supporting his various ambitions in the region, most importantly that of the confrontation with Iran in the region. This is something that Trump really wants as well as apparently a promised rapprochement with Israel. In the tradition of Saudi Arabia, revolting against the royals is not a good idea. It's never been recommended. But does it all end with this or will it lead to more? I think it will lead to more, but will it then lead to discontent among Saudis. It just might."

Mourners gather around the grave of Russian Lieutenant-General Valery Asapov who was killed in Syria, during his funeral at a military cemetery outside Moscow, Russia on September 27, 2017 [Reuters] The first thought that crossed Mark Isaev's mind when he heard of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria on September 30, 2015 was that it would be like Afghanistan . "And here goes Syria as well. They will be sending Russian troops to Syria, I thought," says the 53-year-old Afghan war veteran. "Politicians take decisions, and we, the military men, follow orders." In 1987, as the war was raging on in Afghanistan, Isaev - then a fresh military college graduate - was waiting to leave for Libya , where he was to work as a military instructor. Just weeks before his departure, the military administration discovered a problem in his papers: He was not a member of the Communist Party. Isaev says he refused to join the party and as a result was sent to fight in Afghanistan. His deployment lasted until the Soviet army withdrew in 1989. "According to official statistics, 13,400 [Soviet troops] died [in Afghanistan] and I consider that they died in vain," he says. "We did not need this war." Isaev feels the same way about Russian interventions abroad in general, including the war in Syria. "Russia should not participate. During the Great Patriotic War [World War II], people died for their country, they defended their own country. Now [in Syria], who are we defending?" At the same time, Isaev says that Russia should be fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS ), which he considers a threat. It is Russia's duty, he says, and air raids on ISIL are a good thing. Public opinion Isaev's attitudes towards the Russian intervention in Syria, while seemingly contradictory, reflect popular opinion in Russia. According to a poll conducted by independent polling centre Levada in October 2015, some 72 percent of Russians approved of Russia's "air strikes on ISIL", which is how the Kremlin framed its intervention in state media at that time. The military deployment was necessary in order to stop the threat from ISIL reaching Russian borders, the government rhetoric claimed - although within the first days of Russian bombardment, the Syrian opposition reported that its positions were targeted. Two years into Russia's military operation in Syria, Levada Center conducted another poll which showed that almost half of the respondents wanted the intervention to end. Part of the public concern has been over the deaths of Russian troops in Syria. Currently, the official number of Russian army personnel who have died in Syria is 40, but media reports have claimed that the number could be higher, as the military reportedly pressures families of dead soldiers not to speak out. The official number also does not include Russian mercenaries currently fighting in Syria. More recently the opposition has also started discussing the war in economic terms, claiming that within the current economic crisis, Russia cannot afford to spend so much on a foreign war. "A lot of money from the state budget is being spent on this war, while 17-20 percent of the population live below the poverty line," says Elena Slesareva, press secretary for the presidential campaign of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Opposition party Yabloko has estimated that the war has cost the Russian federal budget at least $2.4bn, a number that does not include some costs, including funding for Russian mercenaries. While there appear to be signs of war-weariness among the Russian public, they have not translated into strong anti-war rhetoric or reaction. There has been no public interest in discussing civilian deaths caused by Russian aerial bombardment in Syria, which within the first four months of the intervention had reached at least 1,000 , according to monitoring groups. The official narrative that Russia uses "precision" air raids and therefore does not cause a significant number of civilian deaths has been widely accepted. Unlike the war in Ukraine, which provoked public outrage and large antiwar rallies in 2014, the military intervention in Syria has not drawn any comparable condemnation. Buying into the state narrative While Russians have protested against the war in Ukraine, there has been no comparable public outrage over the military intervention in Syria [Getty Images] According to human rights activist Sergey Davidis, who participated in a small anti-war protest in October 2015, the general attitude of approval of the Russian intervention persists. He points out that the majority of Russians, including part of the opposition, have bought into the state narrative of the war as an anti-terror operation against ISIL. "A society in which Islamophobia and fear of Islamic terrorism and migration are well spread does not really worry so much about a war waged far away against unpleasant and dangerous people," he said. In his opinion, the opposition, which overwhelmingly rejected the war in Ukraine , perceives the situation in Syria as "bad Putin fighting some other bad people" and has not been so vocal in its condemnation. At the peak of international attention over the siege on Aleppo in November 2016, a group of activists, including Davidis, sought to hold a protest but the Russian authorities banned it. Davidis says the ban was unlawful and he has taken the state to court over it. Russia's 'new Afghanistan' At the same time, official rhetoric continues to portray the intervention as largely successful and many have agreed. "In my opinion, two years into Russia's anti-terrorist operation in Syria, the results have exceeded expectations," says Elena Suponina, a Moscow-based Middle East researcher. "Russia managed to achieve a lot of its goals in Syria at no serious cost or losses." She says that Levada's opinion poll does not necessarily mean less support for the Russian army fighting in Syria. Russians wanting the end of the operation does not mean they want it "quickly", she says. Yet the possibility of a prolonged conflict is something that does worry some part of the Russian public. In the same Levada survey, some 32 percent of the respondents agreed that Syria could become Russia's "new Afghanistan". According to Suponina, no one knows how long Russia's operation in Syria will continue, but the Russian army will continue fighting until "the sovereignty of Syria has been restored".

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab forces backed by the United States , have announced the capture of Raqqa after a four-month operation to drive out ISIL . SDF spokesmen announced the takeover of the strategic Syrian city on Tuesday after a final battle at a sports stadium where Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) fighters made their last stand. Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Antakya, Turkey, said clean-up operations were now under way after the bloody battle. "Hundreds of SDF fighters, waving yellow flags, are now entering the city of Raqqa. They have killed dozens of fighters. They are deploying more troops in the city to try to clear mines, explosives," Ahelbarra said. The SDF launched its offensive on Raqqa on June 6. Intense aerial bombardment and land operations by the US-led international coalition had cut the city off from the rest of the territories held by ISIL. {articleGUID} More than 3,000 bombs have landed on Raqqa since January, devastating schools, hospitals and residential buildings. In mid-October, the humanitarian REACH initiative estimated that less than one percent of Raqqa's 300,000 prewar population remained in the city. The city has no electricity or potable water, and its last functioning bakery was destroyed recently. According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, since the start of the operation, more than 900 civilians have been killed in the violence, including at least 570 in coalition air raids. Destroyed and depopulated, Raqqa also faces an uncertain political future. The US and SDF have pledged to hand over the city to civilian rule, but the shape and political make-up of this civilian entity remain unclear. Various ethnic, tribal and geopolitical factors will complicate the handover. A member of the Syrian Democratic Forces holds up their flag at the iconic Al-Naim square in Raqqa [Bulent Kilic/AFP/Getty Images] Two competing councils Two councils are asserting the right to take over the city: the Raqqa Civilian Council (RCC), founded in April and backed by the SDF; and the Raqqa Provincial Council (RPC), backed by the main Syrian opposition body based in Turkey, the Syrian National Coalition (SNC). The RPC claims to be a successor to the civilian council that began administering Raqqa in 2013 after the Free Syrian Army and Islamist armed groups took the city from the Syrian regime. It rejects the RCC's legitimacy over its links to the People's Protection Units (YPG), a Kurdish armed group at the core of the SDF. Along with its political arm, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), it dominates most of northeastern Syria and is a close US ally. As the YPG and Arab allies pushed into Raqqa province, the Syrian opposition accused it of carrying out ethnic cleansing against Arabs - an accusation YPG officials have denied. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5614448121001,0,0,300,462, "bcvid_5614448121001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > Syrian fighters capture ISIL's self-proclaimed capital in Syria PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Like other SDF-sponsored councils, the RCC has joint Arab-Kurdish leadership. The Arab co-chair is tribal leader Mahmoud al-Borsan, and the Kurdish co-chair is Layla Mohammed, the former co-mayor of her hometown of Tal Abyad on the Syria-Turkey border. Al-Borsan heads the Walda tribe, which was forced to move to Hassakah province from the area near the city of Tabqa in Raqqa province after their lands were flooded during the construction of the Euphrates dam. According to Abdel Aziz al-Hinnedi, a Syrian activist from Raqqa who fled to Germany after ISIL took the city in 2014, the RCC is not representative of the people of Raqqa, but its main strength is that it functions on the ground and provides services, as opposed to the rival RPC, which is in exile in Turkey . {articleGUID} In late September, the US made an effort to reconcile the two councils and create a joint one. Council members and Syrian civil society activists were invited to Rome to meet European Union government representatives. According to Noah Bonsey, a senior researcher at the International Crisis Group, EU countries have been reluctant to engage with the RCC, since they have worked with the SNC in the past few years. The reconciliation attempt failed, however, when the Turkey-based RPC refused to attend the meeting. The RPC's dependence on Turkey, combined with the RCC's affiliation with the YPG - which Turkey deems a "terrorist" organisation - make a merger between the two impossible, Bonsey said. The handover of Raqqa to the RCC could be rocky if the YPG maintains significant influence over the council. "In YPG-held areas, a lot of times the local officials with major roles on paper; in practice, don't actually have a lot of influence, and we've seen aspects of governance basically managed by cadres within the YPG and the PYD. That has been a source of tension in some areas," Bonsey said. Where does the Syrian regime fit in? Another contender for post-ISIL legitimacy in Raqqa is Qamishli-born Ahmad Jarba, a former president of the SNC and a member of the Shammar tribe of eastern Syria. In 2016, backed by Saudi Arabia , he founded the Tomorrow Movement and its military arm, the Syrian Elite Forces. In February, Jarba announced that his 3,000-strong US-trained armed group would participate in the Raqqa battle, but according to al-Hinnedi, the SDF was not comfortable with its presence, and the group withdrew. Jarba has been trying to recruit young men from Raqqa's tribes to join his Tomorrow Movement and the Elite Forces. Although he does not currently enjoy much popularity in Raqqa, he may have a role to play in administering Raqqa, al-Hinnedi said. Yet another potential player on the political scene in post-ISIL Raqqa is the Syrian regime. The SDF has not sought to openly fight regime forces, although more recently there have been deadly confrontations. According to Bonsey, while it is unlikely that the regime would have a military presence in Raqqa after its capture, it may pay for some services or state employee salaries, as it has done in other areas under YPG/PYD control. The RCC has already agreed to use regime-printed textbooks in schools in the areas under its control. Fighters of Syrian Democratic Forces in Raqqa [Rodi Said/Reuters] The tribes The province of Raqqa has been traditionally inhabited by a number of Arab tribes, which various sides in the Syrian war have tried to coopt. In 2011, as protests spread across the country, President Bashar al-Assad sought the reassurance of tribal leaders in Raqqa that the province would stay quiet, and he received it. Three years later, one of ISIL's Syrian leaders, Abu Loqman, is said to have used his connections as a member of the Ajeel tribe to facilitate ISIL's takeover of Raqqa.

(25:00) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Members of different tribes have also fought under the SDF's flag, including Daham Hadi Jarba, head of the Sanadid Forces, leader of the Shammar tribe and cousin of Ahmad Jarba. According to al-Hinnedi, however, tribes are not necessarily unified and can easily change loyalties. "You would not find a tribal leader who carries the national interest and that of the Syrian people," he said. "They seek power and money and personal protection." Will Raqqa be part of Rojava? It is unclear whether Raqqa, with its SDF-backed council, would become part of the Kurdish autonomous project of Rojava, which has worried Turkey. Ankara has been embroiled in a bloody conflict with the Kurdistan Workers' Party ( PKK ), in which more than 1,700 people were killed between 2015 and 2016. The PKK considers the YPG its sister organisation. In March, Saleh Muslim, the former PYD co-chair, told Reuters it was "likely" that Raqqa would join Rojava. Responding to a question on the subject, Mustafa Bali, the SDF's head of media relations, told Al Jazeera in July, "Raqqa is part of Syria and Rojava is also part of Syria … The councils formed in those [liberated] regions will decide what form their administration will take." According to Bonsey, the YPG has thus far not incorporated into Rojava certain Arab-majority areas it has taken from ISIL, such as Manbij. More than 3,000 bombs have landed on Raqqa since January [Rodi Said/Reuters] Policing and rebuilding Raqqa To help secure Raqqa, the US has been training the Raqqa Internal Security Forces (RISF). A statement by the international coalition's Operation Inherent Resolve, sent to Al Jazeera in July, said that the RISF consisted of 500 coalition-trained and vetted officers, and their number was expected to grow to 3,500. In June, Reuters reported that a Kurdish man had been appointed as head of the RISF. The force has already started policing liberated areas around and inside the city of Raqqa, Bonsey said. In the coming weeks, these forces, along with the SDF, will face the challenging task of demining Raqqa. ISIL is known for placing booby traps and mines not only in strategically significant positions during the fighting, but also in civilian housing and farm fields. A much bigger challenge will be the reconstruction of Raqqa. According to al-Hinnedi, the city today is unlivable and will remain so for years. It remains unclear who will foot the bill for the massive destruction caused by the thousands of bombs the US-led coalition dropped on Raqqa. While the coalition is spending about $13m daily to run Operation Inherent Resolve, it has not officially allocated funds for the reconstruction of areas it bombed in Syria. In March, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told a meeting of the 68-nation coalition: "As a coalition, we are not in the business of nation-building or reconstruction." In August, Brett McGurk, special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, said that the US would perform what he called "stabilisation" in Raqqa. Apart from demining, "stabilisation also means rubble removal so that trucks and equipment can get into areas of need. It means basic electricity, sewage, water, the basic essentials to allow populations to come back to their home," he explained. Whether that will be enough for the close to 300,000 Raqqa residents to return to their city remains to be seen.

A counter-protestor makes his voice heard as immigration activists march through New York to mark World Refugee Day on June 20 [Drew Angerer/AFP] It is indescribably devastating to watch as the international community intensifies its push to normalise the occupied, murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad . Major players in Syria are using Syrian lives as leverage and to signal they've had enough of Syrians and their "crisis". Recently, the UNHCR made an odd, somewhat troubling, statement . Based on figures from aid agencies, their spokesman said that 440,000 internally displaced Syrians - meaning Syrians already in Syria - have supposedly returned to their homes since the start of 2017 and that this was a "notable trend". Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5520927069001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5520927069001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: Hezbollah's Syria offensive on agenda of Lebanon-US talks (2:30) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY He then went on to say that despite this, the agency wouldn't recommend or sponsor refugee returns given multiple risks that remain, and that Syrians seeking asylum in other nations needed to be given safe havens. There are two levels of frustration that come with such statements: first, that 440,000 IDPs are being presented as a "notable trend" in the context of over six million Syrians displaced internally and over five million living as refugees in other countries; and second, such statements carry very little weight with an international community that has shown not only is it content with letting Assad and his allies continue creating refugees, but is also willing to join the " war on terror " perpetuated by Assad and his allies. When Syrians 'go back' When the UNHCR says conditions are not ideal for return, it means that Syrians, refugees or not, face risks with any movements they attempt to make, starting from the moment they stand in line at any given border to re-enter their country. Syrians I've spoken to tell me about abuse and corruption at the borders of neighbouring countries. One told me they had to pay bribes to border officials in Jordan to ensure safe passage back to Syria. Several have told me their passports were confiscated in Jordan and they were told to check in with Syrian intelligence branches upon their return to their hometowns. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5520885554001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5520885554001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > Syrian government targets Eastern Ghouta despite safe zone announcement PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Others returning to Syria through Lebanon have waited for hours to be let back into Syria, fearing the worst as Lebanese and Syrian regime officials humiliated and berated them. That's aside from the money they've had taken from them at the borders, which is particularly painful given that most of these Syrians are already suffering financially. Then, there are those whose sons over 18 are immediately whisked off to forced conscription with the regime's army. This problem of forced conscription, faced mainly by young men, is a major risk not only at the borders, but also in areas under the control of the regime and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces . The Assad regime's ministry of defence has recently imposed new laws for punishing any men who attempt to evade mandatory service in the regime's army. Once Syrians make it back into Syria, they have to pass through checkpoints, risking detention at the hands of the regime or various armed militias. Syrians, both refugees and IDPs, tell stories of being questioned for hours by the regime's militias and seeing fellow countrymen killed at these checkpoints. OPINION: Xenophobia will not solve Lebanon's refugee crisis In liberated areas, IDPs also face incidents of harassment and extortion and fall victim to infighting between armed groups. That is beside the continuing air strikes by the Syrian regime, Russia and the US-led international coalition that have killed, maimed and displaced thousands of innocent civilians. Refugee dodge ball On World Refugee Day last month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan gave a speech in which he spoke about Turkey's generosity to refugees, telling the international community Turkey could help advise on how to permanently solve the Syrian refugee crisis. Earlier this year, Turkey and Russia, despite backing opposing sides in Syria, agreed to work together (with Iran ) to establish de-escalation zones across Syria - a plan that never really worked. In one way or another, all of these major players have contributed to Assad and his allies clinging to power and have obstructed the Syrian revolution. Yet, they now have the audacity to resent the presence of Syrian refugees within their borders. And despite the fact Turkey is host to the most Syrian refugees , it has sealed off its Syrian border with a massive wall built for security purposes and to stem the refugee flow . There has also been a growing number of incidents of Turkish border guards shooting at Syrian refugees trying to cross the border. NGOs operating in Turkey - some working with Syrian refugees - are also facing a crackdown by the Turkish government. As isolated incidents, these occurrences wouldn't mean much. But examined as a whole, it is clear refugees are paying the price as Turkey deals with its own internal affairs and attempts to clear out anyone it deems a threat. In Lebanon, three refugee camps were destroyed in a matter of days, two of them destroyed by fires and one of them raided by Lebanese authorities. Dozens of Syrian refugees were arrested in the Arsal camp raid in the name of "fighting terrorism", and at least five of them were returned as bodies , tortured to death in custody. In the days after these incidents, Lebanon's prime minister, Saad Hariri, published a series of tweets, including in them a call to put pressure on the Assad regime to allow the UN to build camps on the Syrian side of the shared border as a means to better protect Lebanese interests. Hezbollah , a backer of the Assad regime and abuser of the Syrian people, is now brokering deals with various actors in Syria to force refugees back over the border from Arsal. Tension in Lebanon is at all-time highs, as is anti-Syrian refugee sentiment. And it is not just Syria's neighbours. In the West, the United States and France have been the loudest about their willingness to acquiesce to Russian demands in Syria. Furthermore, the US has already reached the 50,000 refugee resettlement cap set by the Trump administration, meaning that not only is it allowing abuses to be committed on its behalf in Syria, it is also actively blocking victims of its crimes in Syria from seeking refuge in the US. Syria is also one of the six countries included in Trump's travel ban , which is now being battled in the courts . In one way or another, all of these major players have contributed to Assad and his allies clinging to power and have obstructed the Syrian revolution. Yet, they now have the audacity to resent the presence of Syrian refugees within their borders. Malak Chabkoun is an independent Middle East researcher and writer based in the US.

Fighters of Syrian Democratic Forces walk past the ruins of destroyed buildings near the National Hospital after Raqqa was liberated from the Islamic State fighters [Reuters/Erik De Castro] The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) celebrated winning the battle for Raqqa by recreating the " tank doughnuts " that ISIL did when they seized the city back in 2014. They also secured access for the international media to document that the black flag has been taken down and that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) is no more. What these journalists saw in Raqqa was utter urban destruction on a scale unseen in recent history, worse even than that of west Mosul or eastern Aleppo. Initial estimates suggest that some 1,800 civilians died in the battle and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates that over 80 percent of the city has been damaged or destroyed. All of Raqqa's prewar population of 300,000 Syrians had fled. So what next for this beleaguered city and who will bear the responsibility for its future? According to the monitoring group Air Wars, US-led forces dropped 5,775 bombs, shells and missiles in Raqqa in August alone. Such was the intensity of the attacks that the UN even made the rare call for operations to be eased. The use of explosive weapons in densely populated areas have devastating effects and, unfortunately, Raqqa is a clear illustration of that. Raqqa's electricity and sewage systems have been destroyed, its schools and hospitals decimated. If residents were to return they would find no clean drinking water, no markets, no life as it was before. Those who were in the city during the intensive bombardment will suffer from disabilities and mental health damage for years to come. But Raqqa residents cannot yet think of returning because those responsible for destroying it do not seem that willing to foot the bill for its reconstruction. Back in March US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned that while his country has led operations against ISIL, stabilisation and reconstruction will "require more from all of you". There can be little argument that, in this particular corner of Syria, the Colin Powell doctrine of "you break it, you own it" will be applied. Yet, it will be ridiculous to see the US and its allies willing to spend $13.6m a day to bomb ISIL, but unwilling to spend a dime on reconstruction efforts in those iconic cities that have been "liberated". {articleGUID} Another problem is that it is still unclear how Raqqa will be governed. The UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, has called on parties to the conflict to use the fall of the city to restart stalled attempts to find a political process forward. The SDF has boldly asserted that Raqqa will be part of a decentralised federal Syria, but with the conflict forever unpredictable and with forces loyal to the Syrian regime only some 15km away , it would seem hard to make concrete plans for reconstruction. What is more, while the SDF has repeatedly promoted itself as a mixed Arab-Kurdish force, their raising of a giant banner of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan has already led to concerns about how the new authority plans to govern the city. In terms of practicalities, it may be easier, safer and cheaper to rebuild a new Raqqa next to the old one rather than attempting the laborious and dangerous task of removing explosives, rubble and contaminated materials from the current site. Whatever strategy is adopted it is not going to be cheap and the SDF have already called for the international community to stump up for its costs. Interestingly, reports have suggested that Saudi officials have already visited Raqqa and promised that the country will play a "prominent" role in its reconstruction. Other members of the US-led coalition should also be stepping up and demonstrating the required international leadership and ownership of Raqqa's future, otherwise, the former ISIL capital could become another Middle East "ghost city", symbolic of the absence of a post-ISIL vision. {articleGUID} Earlier this year the UN Humanitarian Chief described the battle for Mosul as " hell on earth " and early estimates of repair costs easily top $1bn "just to restore water, electricity, sewage and schools". As with past post-conflict planning, much hope for resources for Mosul and the other post-ISIL cities in Iraq has been placed on the upcoming Kuwait donor conference in 2018. Raqqa is more complicated as there is no agreement to restore Syrian state authority over the city which remains dependent on the uncertainty as to how the conflict concludes. Yet without the coming together of global players at a conference or moment that can unite around a vision for Raqqa, as well as provide the critically needed funds and urban planning expertise, the concern is that the destroyed city will remain in limbo with most of its residents counting time living in refugee camps. The people of Raqqa have witnessed and paid the ultimate price for years of conflict, occupation and displacement. Today the city, its people and its politics are at a crossroads that will determine if the former capital of the ISIL "Caliphate" can be reborn and restored or whether it will be doomed to decades of neglect.

Key players in Syria's war are meeting in the Kazakh capital, Astana, for talks aimed at implementing a lasting ceasefire agreement and potentially paving the way for a political settlement. Representatives of the Syrian government and some armed opposition groups will be holding talks on Monday and Tuesday. The meeting was organised by Russia and Iran, who support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad 's regime, and Turkey , which backs the opposition. The talks are aimed at finalising a plan for four so-called "de-escalation zones" across eight of Syria's 14 provinces. The zones will include certain areas of Idlib, Latakia, Aleppo, Hama, Homs, Eastern Ghouta, Deraa and al-Quneitra. {articleGUID} The plan, which calls for a halt to regime air raids in these areas, would last for a period of at least six months and be extended if necessary. Sources have told Al Jazeera that the Astana talks will also discuss the release of hostages and prisoners, food and aid delivery to besieged areas, the transfer of dead bodies and the search for missing persons. "Wether they get these prisoner exchanges and anything else they want is likely up to the Russians, the Iranians and the Turkish and the talks they have with the Syrian opposition", Al Jazeera's Imran Khan said from Astana. Russia, Turkey and Iran, who have monitored the talks, will act as guarantors of the de-escalation zones. Khan also said that while it was a closed-door meeting, the fractured Syrian opposition had already relayed their concerns over the role that these countries would play. "Syrian rebels have accused them of instigating violent clashes, with civilians being affected," Khan said. "The Russians have said they're going after Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham [an alliance largely controlled by Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, a former al-Qaeda affiliate] and ISIL fighters, but rebels have accused them of attacking civilians." The talks mark the beginning of the latest diplomatic initiative to put an end to nearly six years of war that have left much of Syria in ruins, killed nearly half a million people, and displaced half of the population. Besides the key players in the war, the United Nations and Jordan will also attend the talks.

Representatives of some of Syria's armed opposition groups attending talks in Kazakhstan say they are hopeful of achieving a lasting ceasefire agreement in eight of the country's 14 war-ravaged provinces. Ayman al-Asemi, a member of the Free Syrian Army's military council attending the talks in Astana, said while the meetings would not produce a final settlement to the war, they could see a final agreement to the set-up of four so-called "de-escalation zones". The Astana talks are aimed at finalising a plan for the four zones, which will include certain areas of Idlib, Latakia, Aleppo, Hama, Homs, Eastern Ghouta, Deraa and al-Quneitra.

(24:59) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The closed-door meetings are also seeing discussions on the release of detainees held by the government of President Bashar al-Assad, as well as about the delivery of food and aid to besieged areas. "This war is far from over," al-Asemi told Al Jazeera. He said while the situation on the ground did not bode well for Syrians, regional and international powers were to blame having exposed themselves as spectators to the violence being perpetrated. "We will not compromise our freedom and our ultimate goal of removing Assad and his regime from power," al-Asemi said. He added that the opposition had submitted several "secret files" to the UN delegation in Astana, with "solid evidence" of crimes committed by the regime. According to al-Asemi, the crimes include the use of chemical weapons, the torture of detainees inside Homs central prison, forced expulsion of residents based on their ethnic and religious affiliations and war crimes committed by Iranian revolution guards against civilians. 'Astana eclipses Geneva' The seventh round of negotiations on the war in Syria was brokered by Russia and Iran, who support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, and Turkey, which backs the opposition. Joshua Landis, a professor at Oklahoma University and editor of the Syria Comment blog, told Al Jazeera that although there have been several international initiatives aimed at bringing the war to an end, "Astana has turned into the real venue for Syria negotiations. He added the talks in Afghanistan had eclipsed "Geneva in importance", referring to the separate UN-sponsored negotiations held in the Swiss city. {articleGUID} Landis said Astana has practically replaced "years of fruitless grandstanding in Geneva" achieving tangible results on the ground in the form of "de-escalation zones", which brought about some reprieve to the affected population. Talks in Geneva had failed to put an end to more than six years of war that left much of Syria in ruins, killed nearly half a million people, and displaced half of the population. Landis said that backers of the Syrian opposition - mostly Gulf Arab states, the US and Turkey - had come to terms with the end of the "revolution". On Monday, former Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Al Thani said that "Qatar, along with Saudi Arabia and the US, had jointly coordinated the arming and funding Syrian opposition groups". Landis said Saudi Arabia and the UAE were now preoccupied with the conflicts in Yemen and Libya and their diplomatic dispute with Qatar. Colonel Fateh Hassoun, who heads the opposition military delegation to the Astana talks, said that he still had faith in the "Syrian revolution." "The aim of the Syrian opposition is still to reach a political solution to the war and lead to a transition period without the regime of Assad."

Representatives of the Syrian government and some armed opposition groups are meeting in the Kazakh capital, Astana, on Monday for talks aimed at implementing a lasting ceasefire agreement. Though there have been several international initiatives aimed at bringing the war, now in its seventh year, to an end, the latest round of Astana talks is aimed at establishing four so-called "de-escalation zones" in mainly opposition-held areas of the country, with Russia, Turkey and Iran acting as guarantors. The meeting is expected to call for a cessation of hostilities between anti-government groups and forces fighting on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad , for a period of at least six months. The plan, which has not yet been published, will call for all aircraft to be banned from flying over these areas , rendering them no-fly zones . Sources have told Al Jazeera that the October 30-31 meeting will also discuss the release of hostages, prisoners, delivery of food and aid to besieged areas, the transfer of dead bodies and the search for missing persons. What areas will be 'de-escalation zones'? The zones will cover four areas of Syria : Zone 1: Parts of Idlib province, as well as parts of northeastern Latakia province, western areas of Aleppo province and northern areas of Hama province. There are more than one million civilians in this zone and its rebel factions are dominated by Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an alliance largely controlled by Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, a former al-Qaeda affiliate. Zone 2: Eastern Ghouta, in the northern Damascus countryside. About 690,000 civilians live there. Jaish al-Islam, a major rebel faction in eastern Ghouta, is participating in the Astana talks.

(24:59) Zone 3: The Rastan and Talbiseh enclave in northern Homs province. There are approximately 180,000 civilians in this zone and its network of rebel groups includes HTS. Zone 4: The rebel-controlled south along the border with Jordan that includes parts of Deraa and Quneitra provinces. Up to 800,000 civilians live there. According to Syrian opposition sources, checkpoints will be positioned within the "de-escalation zones" to facilitate the free movement of unarmed civilians and humanitarian access to the areas. Who will be attending? Russia , an ally of Assad, has repeatedly stated that the "de-escalation zones" will only apply to the "moderate opposition". This excludes Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as al-Nusra Front , and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group. Delegations from the Syrian government and some armed opposition groups have so far confirmed they will be in attendance. The rebel factions that will be represented in Astana include Ahrar al-Sham, Jaish al-Islam, the Sultan Murad Brigade, the Al-Sham army and the Central Division. The discussions will be led by Alexander Lavrentiev, the Russian president's special envoy to Syria; Sedat Onal, Turkey's deputy foreign minister; and Hossein Jaberi Ansari, Iran 's deputy foreign minister. According to Syrian opposition sources, Turkey, which has played a key role in the conflict in recent months by actively supporting rebel forces near its border, will play an intermediary role between the Syrian opposition and others. Also helping to organise the talks is Iran, whose fighters have been battling on the side of Syrian government troops. Delegates from the United Nations and the United States will also be in attendance. However, representatives from Gulf countries, which have supported opposition groups, will not. What's different about these talks? The zones could mark a potential breakthrough towards calming the fighting that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, wounded more than a million, and forced at least 12 million Syrians - half the country's prewar population - to flee their homes. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the set up of "de-escalation zones" could resolve the conflict by as much as "50 percent". Vladimir Sotnikov, a Russia-based Middle Eastern policy analyst and senior research fellow at the Institute of Eastern Studies, told Al Jazeera that the Astana meeting represented a crucial moment for the armed opposition.

"Assad is in a position of strength heading into the talks. The rebels have no option but to sit with the government and negotiate for a better tomorrow." But Colonel Fateh Hassoun, who heads the Syrian opposition delegation to the talks, told Al Jazeera that the aim of their negotiating team is "to reach a political solution that will lead to a transition period without the regime of President Bashar al-Assad". Nizar Al Hiraki, the ambassador of the Syrian Coalition to Qatar, told Al Jazeera he was boycotting the talks as rebels were continuing to fend off a Russian-backed military onslaught. "We don't trust the Russians, and never have. "The Russians and Iranians have been violating their own agreements by continuing the shelling and bombing of areas that were a part of the de-escalating zones," he said. What can we expect six months from now? It remains unclear whether there would be any international monitoring of the " de-escalation zones" , but Sotnikov told Al Jazeera that "international peacekeepers could be an outcome of the talks". "Critics have described the de-escalation plan as the de-facto partitioning of Syria. However, only if some of the rebel groups continue to be stubborn and fight, this could lead to the fragmentation of Syria and the break-up of the country," he said. The establishment of the zones has been received with mixed reactions by residents of the affected areas. Yousef al-Bostani, an activist based in the besieged area of eastern Ghouta, told Al Jazeera that the previous agreements in Astana to lift the siege of eastern Ghouta had failed. "The siege was never lifted and the sick, especially children, are dying from a lack of treatment and medicine," he said. "Unfortunately, people are losing hope in those talks, so in my opinion perhaps it is better to withdraw from the talks," he added. Moreover, the Syrian government has said that while it will abide by the agreement, it will continue fighting "terrorism" wherever it exists. "The situation is worsening by the day," Mazen al-Shami, an activist in eastern Ghouta, said. "The prices of food, commodities and medicine have skyrocketed. "Our campaign to lift the siege of eastern Ghouta will continue until the Russians, the guarantors of the Syrian regime, force their client to end its inhumane siege on innocent civilians."

Backed by Russia, Assad's forces have been fighting to retake Deir Az Zor [G Ourfalan/AFP/Getty Images] A Syrian military source has announced the recapture of three neighbourhoods of Deir Az Zor after eliminating the last remnants of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) group from the eastern city . The army units, in cooperation with supporting forces, simultaneously regained control over the city's al-Hamidya neighbourhood, the official SANA news agency said late on Thursday. The source said that army units continued their operations against ISIL, also known as ISIS, on the southwestern outskirts of Deir Az Zor , inflicting heavy losses on the ranks of the fighters and their equipment. SANA quoted the source as saying army's engineering units started sweeping operations to demine the newly secured neighbourhoods. Earlier, army units tightened encircled ISIL fighters in al-Hamidiya, Sheikh Yasin, al-Hawiqa and al-Rashida neighbourhoods in Deir Az Zor, amid a collapse in their ranks, a SANA reporter said. The reporter said the army units restored control over the Public Park, Nour Hospital after violent clashes with ISIL fighters. Assad's campaign Backed by Russian air raids, the forces of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad have waged a sustained campaign to retake areas in Deir Az Zor province. Meanwhile, a US-led international coalition has provided air support to a Kurdish-Arab alliance, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), also fighting ISIL in Deir Az Zor.

Mourners say good-bye to their beloved king who ruled Thailand for decades [Reuters] Bangkok, Thailand - The day most Thais have been dreading has arrived with the capital adorned in mourning black, as a final farewell is said to the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The funeral ceremony lasts for five days and is full of Buddhist and Hindu traditions, interspersed with the sound of jazz and classical music, written by the late monarch. On Thursday, tens of thousands of people were on the streets directly outside or near a funeral site that artisans have crafted over the past 10 months, transforming an area known as Sanam Luang from a public green space into an elaborate collection of buildings and symbols of King Bhumibol's reign. The centrepiece is a purpose-built crematorium that towers some 50 metres into the air. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(3925061147001, 0, 0, 330, 186, "bcvid_3925061147001"); brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: Thai king credited for fighting opium menace (2:10) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The funeral is taking place just outside the gates of the Grand Palace, where the King's body has rested for the past 12 months. In that time, it became the focal point for grieving Thais wanting to pay their respects. The Palace says that since he died in October last year, around 12 million people took the opportunity to enter the hall where his body lay to pray in front of the royal urn. The palace was expecting around 250,000 people to fill the streets around Sanam Luang, but the number of people lucky enough to be alongside the procession was strictly controlled and those entering the area were subject to security checks. Everyone was clad in black, and with the sun beating down upon them, many succumbed to the heat, having to be assisted by the hundreds of medical staff dotted around the area. For those who can't get close to the procession and funeral site, big screens were been set up alongside replica crematoriums and large portraits of the King where mourners can lay flowers. Lese-majeste controversy This is also proving to be a time of reflection for Thais on how far the country has, or hasn't, come and what's around the corner under a new king, Bhumibol's only son Maha Vajiralongkorn, who ascended the throne soon after his father's death. Freedom of speech has become increasingly curtailed during this sensitive time, with well over a hundred people in jail for allegedly insulting, criticising or defaming the monarchy - a crime punishable by up to 15 years in jail on each count. The number of cases has soared since a military coup in 2014 that many believe was staged to ensure a smooth royal transition. IN PICTURES: The life of Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej The cases have become more extreme, even farcical, with one man arrested for insulting the late king's dog, while a well-known historian was charged for daring to question the events surrounding a famous battle that occurred more than 400 years ago, involving a Thai king's defeat of an invading Burmese prince. The use, or some say abuse, of the so-called lese majeste laws, and decades of elevating and promoting the monarchy by Bangkok's elite, the military and the palace itself, mean there is no space for overt alternative opinions on the royal family or its role in Thai society. Offering one will almost certainly result in a jail sentence. But there are signs that this period of profound change is providing a window for experts and commentators to not only reflect on the life of King Bhumibol and his achievements, but to also question where the country is heading. Writing in the Bangkok Post the day before the funeral, former editorial-pages editor Sanitsuda Ekachai wrote: "We must ask ourselves if our deep grief is a result of over-dependence. The time of loss is then a time to also grow up. Questioning the status quo and taking action for change is a necessary part of this." Regardless of one's view on the monarchy, one fact remains: King Bhumibol Adulyadej was a constant for Thailand through sheer longevity on the throne. For 70 years, he was there during the Cold War, domestic political upheaval, natural and economic disasters. Now that he's gone, grief will be mixed with uncertainty.

The neighbourhood of Bangkok where the Montagnards live [Radu Diaconu/Al Jazeera] Thailand, Bangkok - Far away from the sprawling skyscrapers at the heart of Bangkok's megalopolis lives a small community of 150 Montagnard families. The Montagnards are the native inhabitants of the Central Highlands, one of Vietnam's mountainous regions that is known for its coffee plantations. Predominantly converts to Protestantism, the Montagnards say they have been facing repression and religious discrimination since Vietnam's communist government took power in 1975. The number in Thailand has grown over recent years as more continue to escape what they describe as religious persecution, land expropriation, and arbitrary arrests by Vietnamese authorities. It isn't easy to find them. They live nestled among plantations and canals and surrounded by small bamboo houses above the water. "It's safer for them to live here as there is too much police downtown," explains Grace Bui, the Thailand programme director at the Montagnard Assistance Project. Thailand is not a signatory to the UN's 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees or its 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. As such, the Montagnard asylum seekers have been described by countries such as Cambodia as undocumented economic migrants. They have have no rights or status regardless of their registration with the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR. Stateless in Bangkok "The Vietnamese police used a glass bottle and hit me so hard that they broke my tooth and cut my eye," says Ayun Tre, 50, describing, in his native Jarai language, the 15 days of hard labour he served in 2003 for refusing to renounce his faith. Ayun Tre, 50 [Radu Diaconu/Al Jazeera] Once a farmer in his village in Vietnam's Gia Lai province, Tre left for Thailand in 2015 fearing for his life after he says he was again arrested and beaten in 2014. "I want people to know that we do not have a good life nor justice under Vietnam's oppressive communist regime," he says. "I miss the fresh air and the green trees," says Tre. "But now, the government erased everything I had and nothing is left." They were once among Vietnam's most economically prosperous people. But after decades of land appropriation, they are now some of the poorest. Since the end of the 1960s, there have been several government-led resettlement and modernisation projects in the Central Highlands that have targeted the community. After selling everything he owned, including his only cow and some wood, Tre managed to bring his wife and children to Thailand in late 2016, paying a smuggler about $1,000 per adult and $400 per child. Finally reunited, the family is waiting for an interview with the UNHCR in the hope of being recognised as refugees and resettled in a third country. "Thailand is a free country where we can meet and gather, not like Vietnam," says Tre. But without the appropriate documentation, Tre lives in constant fear of being arrested by local Thai police, detained in Bangkok's Immigration Detention Centre (IDC), and eventually sent back to Vietnam. "The IDC is a very dirty place with very little food," says Pornchai Kamonsin, a Thai pastor from Bangkok's Glory to God Church, who helps the Montagnards with housing and hospital bills, but whose power is limited once the asylum seekers reach the IDC. Pornchai Kamonsin, a Thai pastor from Bangkok's Glory to God Church [Radu Diaconu/Al Jazeera] "When they're sick, I'm the person they call in the middle of the night," he says. Kamonsin also vouches for the paperless Montagnard children who, without his help, would not be able to attend Thai schools. His church was founded seven years ago and while only Thai people attended the services initially , Kamonsin says he has noticed a significant increase in the number of Montagnards over the past few years. "When we first opened, there were only 15 Thais attending the church," he says. "Now, there are over 100 Thais and 200 Montagnards." For him, the problem lies in the fact that there are very few UN legal officers available in Bangkok to help the asylum seekers, as well as the slow process of examining each case. Grace Bui concurs. "Not only are there few UN officers but the number of translators from the Jarai language to English or Vietnamese is almost nonexistent, and a vast majority of Montagnards do not speak Vietnamese," Bui says. Nay Hoch, a 45-year-old farmer from Gia Lai, is awaiting his fifth interview, now scheduled for July 2017, with UNHCR after it was cancelled and rescheduled four times. Nay Hoch, 45 [Radu Diaconu/Al Jazeera] "While many countries have national systems and staff to cope, in Thailand UNHCR does the processing with far fewer resources," explains Jennifer Bose, the UNHCR's associate reporting officer in Bangkok. "We are much underfunded in this operation and have eight trained legal staff to process 4,000 asylum cases in Bangkok," Bose says. Thailand has long been a hub for asylum seekers from around the world. According to Asylum Access, a US-based non-profit organisation dedicated to helping refugees worldwide, there are more than 8,000 refugees currently living in the Thai capital from countries such as Pakistan, Syria, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. Arrested for working illegally on a construction site with no papers, Hoch spent two nights in a Thai prison before being released after the intervention of Kamonsin. "It's hard to live in Thailand because I'm a man and I cannot work to feed my family," says Hoch. He knows too well what being imprisoned feels like. Back in Vietnam, he was arrested for practising his religion and sentenced to five months in jail and hard labour in 1987. "They beat up everybody in my village and made me dig sewers and drains as a punishment for my faith," he says. A 2015 Human Rights Watch report stated that the Central Highlands have been subjected to a series of crackdowns from the Vietnamese authorities as part of a systematic, high-level policy meant to rid the country of so-called "evil-way" religions practised by the Montagnards. The report was meant to be presented in Bangkok on June 26, 2015, but Thai military officials cancelled the news conference because of concerns it would threaten relations with Vietnam. Last year, the two countries celebrated 40 years of diplomatic relations. Vietnam's deputy foreign minister, Vu Hong Nam, declared that the two-way trade between Vietnam and Thailand was set to reach $20bn by 2020. A long history of persecution On November 18, 2016, Vietnam passed its first law on religion since the communists came to power. It will come into effect in January 2018. Critics argue that the law limits religious freedom by increasing state control and criminalising independent religious groups. Rmah Aloh, 27 [Radu Diaconu/Al Jazeera] It is Rmah Aloh's second attempt at applying for asylum in Thailand. The 27-year-old farmer from Gia Lai first escaped religious persecution on February 14, 2014. Aloh's troubles began in 2004 when he took part in a peaceful protest organised by the Montagnards. "That's when my life in Vietnam became difficult," he says. "Local police would not allow me to practise my religion." After forbidding him from attending church services, the police eventually arrested him and closed his church. According to the Human Rights Watch report, demonstrations in 2001 and 2004 were crushed by the Vietnamese authorities who arrested hundreds of Jarai highlanders, and used torture and arbitrary arrests to extract confessions and fictitious public statements of remorse by protest organisers. After escaping through the Cambodian jungle, Aloh's life in Bangkok took a turn for the worse in July 2015, when the Vietnamese police got hold of his phone number after he had called home. "They asked me to come back and promised me and my family that nothing would happen to me," he says. After agreeing to this, Aloh was met by Vietnamese policemen in the middle of the night at his home in Bangkok and put on a train heading to Laos. "As soon as we crossed the border into Laos, that's when the nightmare started," he says. When the train stopped, he says they all disembarked, went to a hideout where Aloh was handcuffed, repeatedly beaten, and starved for a few days. He says he was made to sign a prepared statement saying that he came to Thailand in search of prosperity and a better life and not because of the persecution against his people. "They were very violent and I wanted them to stop beating me, so I signed it," he says. For Anna Nguyen, a human rights lawyer and ASEAN programme coordinator at VOICE, it is technically against international law for government officials to go to foreign countries to arrest or bring back their own citizens. "However, this is not to say that this doesn't happen," she says. "I've heard a lot of stories but do not know of any specific cases. This also commonly occurs in Cambodia and I've heard that [the] Cambodian government works quite closely with the Vietnamese government to return illegal Vietnamese migrants." Once back in his village in Gia Lai, Aloh says his life was marked by constant harassment, threats and daily arrests. Pictures obtained from his mobile phone show him being interrogated, questioned and photographed by the Vietnamese police. "They told everyone in the village that I was spreading propaganda against the government," he says. When he received a summons from the government to appear in court, he went into hiding at his sister's home and borrowed some money to escape. As retribution for leaving once again, he learned through a phone call from his family that his wife had been raped by police. "Don't believe the communist government," he says. "They tricked me once, they will trick me again." After managing to bring his wife to Thailand in December 2016, he is now waiting for the UN to reopen his asylum case as it was closed after too much time passed since his first time in Bangkok. A central demand of the Montagnards' 2001 and 2004 protests was the restitution of their ancestral lands, which have and continue to be taken away by the Vietnamese government. Nay Bro, 62 [Radu Diaconu/Al Jazeera] Nay Bro, 62, one of the organisers of the 2001 protest, arrived in Bangkok in November 2016 with the help of a pastor in Ho Chi Minh City. As a punishment for taking part in a public demonstration, he was sentenced to seven years in prison in February 2005. While he was in jail, his wife was repeatedly beaten and now suffers from nerve damage. "I will never, ever go back," he says. "My son is still in jail. It's been 12 years now; I don't know what happened to him." Now in Thailand, Bro and his wife must rely on the help of Kamonsin and the Montagnards Assistance Project to pay for their THB 3,000 ($86.50) rent. For the Montagnards, recognition of land rights is done orally among clans and families. But according to historian Oscar Salemink in his book, The Ethnography of Vietnam's Central Highlanders, the Vietnamese communist regime sees the land as "res nullius", or "unclaimed by anyone". In this context, Vietnam's 1993 Land Law, which has been amended several times, most recently in 2003, stipulates that a person using the land must be compensated and told why the land is to be recuperated by the state. The Montagnards interviewed by Al Jazeera say that their ancestral lands were confiscated without notice, explanation or compensation in every case. Al Jazeera contacted the Vietnamese embassy in Bangkok, and this was the response: "In Vietnam, all fundamental freedoms of citizens are codified in the constitution and respected in practice. This has received wide recognition and appreciation by the international community. The Embassy affirms that the information given to you by the group of people mentioned is false. There is a small number of Vietnamese nationals from the Central Highlands who illegally crossed the border to Thailand due to neither suppression nor banishment at home but sole economic reasons, hoping to be resettled in a third country." "During recent years, Vietnam has been implementing socio-economic development policies in the Central Highlands to support and improve the lives of the communities in this region. Vietnam is also strongly committed and actively engaged with neighbouring countries in efforts to regulate migration and prevent illegal migration, on the basis of international law and Vietnamese law," the embassy added. Forgotten allies of the US Back in 2007, when he was arrested the first time by Vietnamese police, Ro.o Y Brik, 72, from Dak Lak, was told his religion belonged to the French and the Americans. "They accused me of trying to overthrow the government and asked me if I belonged to FULRO," he says. "But I don't know much about it, I don't follow anyone but God." Ro.o Y Brik, 72 [Radu Diaconu/Al Jazeera] FULRO, or the United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races, was an armed movement that sought independence for the Montagnards from Vietnam. It is said to have been disbanded in 1992. Brik, one of the oldest members of the Montagnard community in Bangkok, fought alongside the French troops during the French-Indochina War and the US army during the Vietnam War. "I was never a leader, only a follower," he says. In addition to the issues of religion and land, the Montagnards' former alliance with the US during the Vietnam War continues to exacerbate the communist government's suspicion that they represent a foreign threat to national unity. Now caught in limbo in Bangkok, Brik's future and that of his community in Thailand looks uncertain. For Grace Bui, the only way to offer them a better life is to resettle them in a third country. "Given the current US administration, our hope is in Canada," she says. "Canada has recently accepted some of the last remaining Vietnamese boat people from the Vietnam War, but the Montagnards remain a forgotten people." Canada, along with Australia, and the US have been the world's top resettlement countries, according to UNHCR. Together, the three countries account for 90 percent of all resettlements. Despite this, "UNHCR has been emphasising to all refugees and asylum seekers here that resettlement is not a right or a given," says Jennifer Bose, from the UNHCR in Bangkok. "There are not enough resettlement places for every refugee who needs it." "Less than 1 percent of the world's refugees actually get the chance to start a new life in a resettlement country," she explains. When asked if they knew that Thailand did not recognise refugees, the Montagnards interviewed say they did. Yet, this did not deter them from fleeing to the kingdom, as they say the limited window of opportunity was better than the oppression they faced back home. Not knowing whether he will stay indefinitely in Thailand or will be able to start a new life elsewhere, Tre's only wish, he says, is for the world to understand how the communist government treats his people. "[I hope] the regime will change to allow human rights, freedom and dignity to live our lives," he concludes.

Chai Buri District, Thailand - As he manoeuvred his pick-up truck along the dirt track leading to his village of Klong Sai Pattana one afternoon, Supot Kalasong, 42, heard a loud bang. He had been driving home after getting an oil-change in a nearby town and for a split second, he thought one of his tyres had exploded, burst by one of the sharp rocks on the path. But when a man wielding a gun leapt from a ditch on the right side of the car, he realised someone was trying to kill him. "It wasn't until the second bullet was fired that I realised it was gunfire," Kalasong said a few months after the attack. "I tried to get away to the left side and was shot in the leg twice. I then tried to grab the radio walkie-talkie to call for help from our security team, but he kept firing until the fifth bullet went into my arm," recalls Kalasong of the incident that took place on April 8, 2016, in Surat Thani Province in southern Thailand. Kalasong would have been killed had it not been for two villagers who, upon hearing the shots, ran down the hill towards the car less than 200 metres away. Spooked by their approach, the gunman fled into the dense undergrowth of a palm oil plantation. Kalasong was taken to a hospital in the provincial capital, returning to the village 12 days later to recover. On that day, remarkably, he survived. Four other villagers from the Klong Sai Pattana community, however, were not quite as lucky. Supot Kalasong's car showing bullet holes after an attempt was made on his life [Al Jazeera] The investigation Since 2008, this community of around 70 families have been embroiled in a conflict with a palm oil company that locals believe is behind the violence. For decades the palm oil company Jiew Kang Jue Pattana Co Ltd has illegally occupied and cultivated palm oil trees on a 535-acre plot of land in the Chai Buri District of Surat Thani Province. The company operated with no official legal documentation or land concession, until the Southern Peasant's Federation of Thailand (SPFT) began investigating them and collecting evidence. The SPFT was officially registered in 2008 but its founding members have long been fighting for land reforms in Surat Thani Province. The organisation works on behalf of landless farmers, identifying expropriated land owned by the state that can be made available for living and cultivation. It reported its findings about the palm oil company to the Agricultural Land Reform Organisation (ALRO), a government agency in Surat Thani, which then took legal action against the company in 2005, suing them for illegal trespassing and land encroachment. The ALRO won this case in the provincial court in 2007, but the palm oil company appealed the verdict continuously. In 2014, the ALRO resolutely won the case when a final decision was handed down by the Supreme Court in Bangkok. But, even in 2008, after the successful resolution of the initial court case, hundreds of landless farmers under the supervision of the SPFT settled on a 26-hectare part of this land - building ramshackle houses from wood and growing small crops. In May 2010, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's cabinet passed a regulation on the Issuance of Community Land Title Deeds and the community has been expecting to receive a land title deed since then. This cabinet resolution set up a community land title deed programme which offers land use documents to entire communities as part of the government's broad strategy to help reduce income disparity within the society. But the people of Klong Sai Pattana have yet to receive a deed. Supot Kalasong works in the communal meeting hall preparing documents to submit to government agencies [Luke Duggleby/Al Jazeera] No backing down The community has refused to succumb to intimidation and be forced off the land despite continuous opposition to their presence through ongoing violence from what they believe to be people hired by the palm oil company. Prateep Rakangthong, 62, has lived in the village since its establishment in 2008. "I asked the villagers whether they want to stay and fight for our right to be here. Most said they had nowhere else to go," explains Rakangthong, a respected figure in the village and committee member of SPFT. "The first month I moved here, I could hear gunfire every night. They were firing bullets into our village at night-time," he recalls, sitting in the pavilion in the centre of the village often used for meetings. What began as intimidating warning tactics ultimately resulted in the fatal shooting of their first community member, Somporn Pattaphum, in 2010. " In 2010, the influential group of investors tried to drive us out the area by using tractors to destroy our houses," Rakangthong says, referring to the palm oil company. "One of our members was shot dead. Some villagers left while some wanted to stay and fight back." Other deaths followed. In 2012, Montha Chukaew, 54, and Pranee Boonrat, 50, were found shot dead. The two women were found a few minutes away from the entrance of the village, at the edge of a palm oil plantation surrounded by assault rifle bullet cases. In 2015, another villager, Chai Bungtonglek was found shot dead outside his family home.

"When we visited the community in 2010, we went there to represent the Rights and Liberties Protection Department (RLPD) because we'd received complaints about people being killed and property being damaged," explains Nongporn Roongpetchwong, deputy director general of the Rights and Liberties Protection Department under the Ministry of Justice in Bangkok. "I went there myself. It was very scary at that time. We saw the conditions that they lived in," she explains in a meeting room inside the sprawling government compound in northern Bangkok. To date, however, no one has been held accountable for the murders and acts of violence in Klong Sai Pattana, even though officials in Bangkok are aware of the community's plight. "In my personal opinion, in the case of human rights defenders in Klong Sai Pattana community, it's still ambiguous because there's a fight going on to take over the land that belongs to the government and those individuals do not have the right and neither does the company," the deputy director general told Al Jazeera. Pranom Somwong, the country representative of Protection International, a human rights organisation, explained that they work "very hard to put recognition on SPFT as a community-based human rights defender organisation. Because, first of all, people are scared about assisting them, in part because they have doubt about the occupation of the land and don't understand the community land title issue," she says from her cramped Bangkok office. "At the beginning - diplomats, the media and others didn't dare go to Klong Sai Pattana because of too many killings there. So we [Protection International] affirm their legitimacy at the national and international level, recognising SPFT as very rightful and inspirational land rights defenders and eventually a delegation from the European Union and Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights of the United Nations visited the community," she explains. After numerous attempts, Al Jazeera was unable to reach the Jiew Kang Jue Pattana Co Ltd using publicly available contact information for comment on the numerous allegations brought by the organisations and villagers. Pratip Rakhungthong, 61, lights dried lemongrass grown in the village to keep away mosquito's [Luke Duggleby/Al Jazeera] Working with the community Protection International is an international non-profit organisation dedicated to the protection of human rights defenders and has worked with the community since 2012. As well as supporting the community with legal and security assistance, the organisation has worked to raise awareness of their plight both within Thailand and outside. "The first day, they [Ministry of Justice] went down they had lots of questions and we felt they were still not understanding the issue. The Ministry of Justice asked how SPFT could still be peacefully defending their rights because there had been so many killings," Somwong says. Faced with such violence and having received no assistance from the government, the community has taken measures to protect themselves peacefully and collectively. "Since villagers were killed, we started to protect ourselves rather than waiting for help from the government," Kalasong says. "The security team has been arranged for everyone's safety. There's a rule that no one can leave the village after 6pm until 7am the next day. It's not safe to leave the village when it's dark. We all agreed on this since the deaths of Ms Montha and Ms Pranee." Every morning at 7am the villagers of Klong Sai Pattana meet, take roll call, talk about anything out of the ordinary the previous day, voice any grievances and do morning exercises. They understand that in such a prolonged and dangerous battle their strength is in their cohesion. The morning meetings, as well as monthly group projects, are aimed at keeping the community together and strong [Luke Duggleby/Al Jazeera] The village has four security posts constructed of sand bags and wood, located at its four outer corners. Every villager - man or woman - takes turns to man the posts in groups of three to four with rotating shifts every 12 hours in order to ensure the posts are manned 24 hours a day. The only entrance for vehicles is closed at night to all traffic, with the exception of emergencies. Every vehicle that enters or leaves is meticulously logged in books, recording the licence plate, date, time and reason of entry. The more senior members of the community always carry walkie-talkies and video cameras attached to the dashboards of their pick-up trucks. The community hold daily gatherings at 7am where they perform role call, discuss anything out of the ordinary and voice grievances. Everything is discussed and decided communally. Pitak Kongdi, 52, and other villagers on security duty get ready to sleep in a bunker built next to one of the security posts. Regularly unknown gunmen fire bullets in to the air and at the village from the darkness of the surrounding palm oil plantation. This specific security post sits a hundred metres away from one of the palm oil companies buildings and as a result, some members prefer to sleep in this large bunker they made [Luke Duggleby/Al Jazeera] Things are slowly improving for Klong Sai Pattana and there are signs that the years of lobbying by the community, SPFT and other groups such as Protection International and the UN High Human Rights Commission (OHCHR), the Thai government is taking the threat against human rights defenders and communities more seriously. In 2013, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights defenders stepped in to raise the issue of Klong Sai Pattana with the Thai authorities. The Ministry of Justice has been tasked with setting up so-called "working groups" that puts focus on those at greatest risk. For these groups, Klong Sai Pattana has been selected as the pilot case. "The working group will focus on the protection of the community leaders, whereas the Rights and Liberties Protection Department will look at the human rights violations in accordance with our mission. From this, the working group will be able to set up an organised model where it can specify criteria of who human rights defenders are, how to protect them and if there should be regulations to support them," Roongpetchwong says. It remains to be seen whether the actions of these working groups can prevent further violence towards the community, but they are hoping that this path will ultimately lead to the universal recognition of their right to live and farm at Klong Sai Pattana, something for which they have fought for almost a decade.

Sex trafficking victim in Thailand: 'She caught me. I didn't know what to do. She took my passport and I had to go back to work.' [Paula Bronstein/Getty Images] It's nearly 10pm and Umida* is cooking dinner - a simple meal of rice and meat for the 11 members of her household who have been stuck inside the house all day due to Uzbekistan's intense summer heat. Since emerging as an independent nation in 1991, after nearly 200 years of Russian and then Soviet rule, Uzbekistan has slowly seen some economic progress. But poverty and unemployment remain high and many Uzbeks travel abroad for work. This leaves the men, women and children vulnerable to forced labour and sex trafficking. "My older sister works in a hospital in Moscow, so I look after her children," Umida says. "She's the only one who understands what happened to me in Bangkok, I have told nobody else." Born into a large, impoverished family, the 36-year-old says life was difficult growing up. Her mother died in 2000, leaving her father, a builder, to care for his four children. "It was hard without my mother," she recalls, "the families in my town with two parents had more money." When she was 28 years old, Umida says she met a local Uzbek woman who promised her profitable work in Thailand . Umida doesn't say whether she knew the specific nature of this work, but explains that with the hope of providing for her son who was then six years old, she agreed to travel to the Thai capital, Bangkok. But, when she arrived in Thailand, she realised that she had been deceived. The woman who had made the arrangements destroyed all of her documents. "She was a very bad lady. She gave me no food, no money. I could only go outside to work every day," Umida says quietly. The woman forced her to work as a prostitute on the streets of Bangkok. Trafficked for sex Many downtown Bangkok streets are lined with women, shifting from one foot to the other, whispering to passers-by, hoping to attract their next customer. Statistics from the Thai Ministry of Public Health and from NGOs indicate that there are more than 120,000 people working in the Thai sex industry.

Annie Dieselberg, CEO and founder of Nightlight International, an organisation committed to helping victims of sex trafficking and exploitation, says that the authorities do not always take the situation seriously. "Often, authorities don't recognise the complexities of sex trafficking - that it isn't as simple as underage women in a brothel, " Dieselberg says. "It may be an adult woman, walking the streets of Bangkok, being forced against her will to work for sex." Angkhana Neelapaichit, one of the seven National Human Rights Commissioners appointed by the Thai king to examine and report acts which violate human rights or "do not comply with obligations under international treaties to which Thailand is a party", concurs. "Essentially, I can say that dealing with trafficking among sex workers, in the long run, is still challenging for Thailand and it is hard for authorities to find the real perpetrators," she says. After a few months, Umida attempted to escape her trafficker, anxious to return home to her son. She managed to convince one of her clients, who sympathised with her, to give her money for a return flight home. "He gave me a lot of money, so I bought some things for my son and a plane ticket home," Umida says. She went to the Uzbek consulate in secret and was issued with a certificate to return to Uzbekistan. When she arrived at the airport, however, a woman with a face veil approached her. She revealed herself as the trafficker. She was angry and threatening - Umida felt powerless before her. "She caught me. I didn't know what to do. She took my passport and I had to go back to work." She worked for a further five months, receiving little to no money. She was made to stay in an apartment with no shower and no food, she recalls. "I was hungry. It was only when I had a customer that I could have a meal. We would go out and drink and eat," she says of the meetings with clients. "Then we would end up in a hotel or an apartment." Interactive - Human trafficking [Al Jazeera] Escaping the clutches of her trafficker Umida saw another chance for escape when she met Emily Chalke, cofounder of Ella's Home, an NGO helping women exiting trafficking and exploitation. Chalke, working at Nightlight International at the time, met Umida at a Bangkok hotel known for hosting exchanges between sex workers and their customers. Chalke explains that she met Umida after another Uzbek woman told her that Umida's passport had been taken away. "Everyone at the hotel knew her as the girl who was in trouble," Chalke says. Umida told Chalke that she wanted to escape. They agreed to meet at another hotel so she could pretend that she was going to see a client and from there they took a taxi to a safe house. "She was angry when I met her, so angry that so much had been taken from her," Chalke says. "She only had the clothes on her back and a small notebook where she had written the amounts paid to her trafficker, more than $10,000 by that time." Nightlight International made the arrangements for her return home and reported the case to the police. The trafficker was arrested, Chalke says. It was the first arrest police had made of an Uzbek trafficker in four years. But this required Umida to make a statement. She was terrified. "I had to go to court once. I was so scared to see the bad lady," she says, adding: [But] the people around me helped me and I was able to do it." Her trafficker, however, was freed after paying bail and disappeared, never to be prosecuted. Read a related article on the victims of modern day slavery trafficking in the UK Prosecuting traffickers in Thailand The trial on July 19 in which Bangkok's Criminal Court Division for Human Trafficking convicted 62 people on charges of human trafficking, including an army general, was Thailand's largest human trafficking trial and an unprecedented achievement for the Thai military government. Dieselberg says the current government is accomplishing more than its elected predecessors. "When we began helping victims of sex trafficking in 2010, justice honestly seemed out of reach." Still, she thinks that more needs to be done. "Though the military is absolutely doing more to address trafficking, it is primarily addressing labour trafficking, the seafood industry, and minors." In many cases, the sex trafficking rings are small, comprising one to five women, whereas labour traffickers often exploit more victims at one time. "Many large anti-trafficking organisations lack the financial and human resources to focus on smaller cases, so there is a greater value in targeting a greater number of people in one place," Dieselberg explains. Neelapaichit, the Human Rights commissioner, agrees. "[Dealing with sex trafficking] is very challenging for Thailand. Thailand tries to show they have policies to fight against trafficking, but there are still many traffickers that are free and have no criminal offences." There can also be improvements in providing safety and services for the victims, Dieselberg feels. "At the moment, it is still not considered beneficial to a victim to identify the trafficker and take them to court ... she would rather return home and be safe." Out of the approximately 100 victims of sex trafficking her organisation has helped, only three initially agreed to testify. This led to two court cases but neither resulted in a prosecution. Dieselberg says she hopes the immediate effect of the high-profile case will be a warning to traffickers, but adds that they always look for other ways to continue their trade. "It sends a message, but a law only makes a difference if it is enforced continuously." Neelapaichit agrees, " Thailand must continue to show that it really wants to fight human trafficking and will not allow perpetrators to walk freely, even if the traffickers are from Thailand or are officers or security forces." It took three months for the police to gather the information they required in Umida's case and for her to receive her travel documents, but she finally returned to Uzbekistan and to her son on October 20, 2009. Her son is now 14 years old. "I am home with him and he goes to school every day," she says proudly. She helps her younger sister bake bread and care for the family. She is determined to express how much her life has improved since Bangkok. "After I returned to my son, I found us a place to live. I don't want to remember the bad times. I don't think about them. I only remember the kind people that helped me and the friends I made. Life is so good for me now, now I am happy." *Name changed to protect identity Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(4168012769001,0,0,300,462, "bcvid_4168012769001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > Counting the Cost: The business of human trafficking (3:52) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY SOURCE: Al Jazeera ABOUT THE AUTHOR Ashton Kobler Human Rights Thailand Uzbekistan Asia Pacific Poverty & Development
Babar Ahmad and Talha Ahsan were detained for eight and six years respectively while appealing extradition to the US [Reuters] The last few weeks have been challenging for the British government and its counterterrorism policies - and for a good reason. Ever since the war on terror began, in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the UK has happily embraced the lawless novelties conceived by the Bush administration - including extraordinary rendition and indefinite detention without charge or trial. One aspect of Britain's complicity in extraordinary rendition involves the island of Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean, a British Overseas Territory that has been leased to the US since the 1970s. In December 2002, it was first reported, in the Washington Post , that Diego Garcia was "one of a number of secret detention centers overseas" where the CIA was holding and interrogating prisoners of the "war on terror". In October 2003, Time reported that "a regional intelligence official" had stated that Hambali, a "high-value detainee" seized in Thailand two months earlier, was being held and interrogated on Diego Garcia, and in the years that followed, other claims were made, both by journalists and by retired US general Barry McCaffrey, who, in May 2004 and December 2006 , referred to prisoners being held on Diego Garcia. PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Nevertheless, both Prime Minister Tony Blair and foreign secretary Jack Straw denied that Diego Garcia had been used as a prison, or even that rendition flights had passed through the territory. It was not until February 2008 that Straw's replacement, David Miliband, told parliament that the US authorities had just discovered that two flights, each carrying a single prisoner, had refuelled on Diego Garcia in 2002. "The detainees did not leave the plane," Miliband explained, "and the US Government has assured us that no US detainees have ever been held on Diego Garcia." In August 2008, the Observer reported that Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon was told by US intelligence agents that Mustafa Setmarian, a Syrian based in Spain, had been "taken to Diego Garcia in late 2005 and held there for months", and in July 2009 Reprieve , the legal action charity, identified one man rendered through Diego Garcia as former Guantanamo prisoner, Mohammed Saad Iqbal Madni. Since then, there have been other claims, further undermining US and UK credibility - claims that, for example, Abdul Hakim Belhadj and Sami al-Saadi , two opponents of Libya's Colonel Gaddafi, who were kidnapped with their families, and with UK assistance, had passed through Diego Garcia. Allegations resurface In April, the alleged "black site" on Diego Garcia surfaced once more, when, for Al Jazeera , Jason Leopold reported that two US officials who have read portions of the Senate Intelligence Committee's 6,600-page report into the Bush administration's torture programme, said that the CIA "detained some high-value suspects on Diego Garcia" in a "black site" established "with the 'full cooperation' of the British government". The report took four years to complete, but is still unpublished because of wrangling with the CIA. As Leopold described it, the report's evidence about Diego Garcia "would confirm long-standing claims by human rights investigators and journalists, whose allegations - based on flight logs and unnamed government sources - have routinely been denied by the CIA" - and, of course, by the British government.

This prompted Cori Crider of Reprieve to state, "The government might as well have said the dog ate their homework. This smacks of a cover-up." This conclusion was strengthened when, just days later, a UK government official was photographed carrying copies of emails discussing flight records whose existence the government has persistently denied, and the latest twist came on July 16, when a Foreign Office official stated that, after "a fuller inspection", the BIOT authorities had discovered that "previously wet paper records" - the result of a leaking roof during "extremely heavy weather in June 2014" - had "dried out". Deeply flawed processes To add to the credibility issues raised by the latest Diego Garcia revelations, the UK government also needs questioning about its treatment of Babar Ahmad, a computer specialist, and Talha Ahsan, a poet who has Asperger's Syndrome. Both men are British citizens, and they were extradited to the US in October 2012 as part of the deeply flawed UK-US extradition treaty of 2003. In 2011, the UK parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights issued a critical report, stating that safeguards in UK to US cases were "inadequate", and, as the BBC explained , also said that "more evidence was needed to justify requests and judges should be able to refuse them if they were not in the 'interests of justice.'"

PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Babar Ahmad and Talha Ahsan were held without charge or trial in the UK for eight years and six years respectively as they challenged their extradition. However, after the last legal challenge failed, they were extradited , spending over two years in a maximum security prison in Connecticut. At their trial in December 2013, they both agreed to a plea deal, accepting that they provided material support to the Taliban and to mujahideen in Chechnya through websites in which they raised money and recruited fighters in return for sentences less than the 25 years and 15 years sought by the prosecution. Until they were extradited, neither man had set foot in the US, and the only basis for their extradition was that one of the servers for Ahmad's website was based in Connecticut. Last week, in the federal court in New Haven, Judge Janet Hall gave Babar Ahmad a twelve-and-a-half year sentence, but gave him credit for the eight years he has already spent imprisoned in the UK, and his two years in the US. He is to be returned to the UK to serve the remainder of his sentence, and with good behaviour will be released in 13 months. In Talha Ahsan's case, Judge Hall gave him a sentence of time served (eight years in total), and he should soon be back in the UK, a free man. What the UK and US governments both need to do now is to make sure that no one else is pointlessly extradited like Babar Ahmad and Talha Ahsan. In July 2004 and December 2006, the Crown Prosecution Service declared that there was "insufficient evidence" to charge Ahmad with any criminal offence under UK law, as did Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, in September 2006, and yet neither the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, nor the current Tory-led coalition government, took any interest. Instead, Theresa May, the current home secretary, drew understandable accusations of racism when, having gloated about the successful extradition of Ahmad, Ahsan and three other men in the opening words of her speech at the Conservative Party Conference in October 2012, she then refused to extradite Gary McKinnon , a hacker who also has Asperger's Syndrome, the week after. Given the previous behaviour of senior UK government officials, whether Labour or Conservative, it seems unlikely that the truth about Diego Garcia will be produced willingly, but it is to be hoped that the belated nod towards fairness in the sentences handed down by Judge Hall in Connecticut will have repercussions in the UK that cause the government to think very carefully about its counterterrorism policies.

There will be concerted efforts by the CIA and by ex-Bush era officials to defend their actions, writes Worthington [AP] What a dark day for the United States. Five years and nine months after Senators Dianne Feinstein and Kit Bond, the chair and vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, announced a review of the CIA's detention and interrogation programme in the so-called "war on terror", the 500-page executive summary of that report has been made publicly available. Its conclusions are shocking. As Feinstein explained in an interview with the Los Angeles Times at the weekend, "We have to get this report out. Anybody who reads this is going to never let this happen again." Let us hope so - and let us also hope that senior officials in the Bush administration, as well as senior CIA personnel, will eventually be held accountable for their actions. A decade of denials The CIA's torture programme, initiated almost immediately after the 9/11 attacks, remained a closely guarded secret for many years. An early revelation was a June 2004 leak of a memo which purported to redefine torture so that it could be used by the CIA. The memo was written by John Yoo, a lawyer in the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), who was close to Dick Cheney.

The Bush administration still refused to openly acknowledge the programme until September 2006, when then President George W Bush announced that, with the arrival of 14 "high-value detainees" at Guantanamo from various "black sites", the programme he had denied the existence of until that time had now closed down. That statement, we subsequently learned, was not entirely true, as a few other prisoners arrived at Guantanamo from CIA custody in 2007 and 2008, but the torture report provides conclusive proof. "By March 2006," the report states, "the programme was operating in only one country. The CIA last used its enhanced interrogation techniques on November 8, 2007. The CIA did not hold any detainees after April 2008." After the arrival of the "high-value detainees" at Guantanamo, numerous attempts were made to pierce the veil of secrecy that surrounded the programme. In 2007, Swiss Senator Dick Marty published an influential report for the Council of Europe about secret prisons and rendition in Europe. In February 2008, CIA Director Michael Hayden admitted that three "high-value detainees" had been subjected to waterboarding. In December 2008, the Senate Armed Services Committee published a powerful report about how the policies for dealing with prisoners in the "war on terror" had developed - including detailed analysis of how the US military's SERE programme (intended to train US personnel to resist torture if captured by a hostile enemy) had been reverse-engineered for the "war on terror". In April 2009, harrowing interviews with the 14 "high-value detainees", conducted by representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross, were leaked, and in August 2009 an internal CIA report from 2004 into the agency's detention and interrogation policies after 9/11 was released containing details of how one prisoner, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri (one of the three men waterboarded, along with Abu Zubaydah and Khalid Sheikh Muhammad), was physically abused and threatened with a gun and power drill while hooded at a "black site" in Thailand. In 2010 I wrote a detailed analysis of the secret detention program me for a UN study , in which I sought to ascertain the identities of the 94 "ghost prisoners" in CIA custody - including 28 subjected to "enhanced interrogation" - who were referred to in a memo from 2005 by OLC lawyer Steven G Bradbury that was released by the Obama administration in April 2009. Another major report, by the Constitution Project, was published in 2013 . A shocking report And yet, although some of the gruesome facts about the torture programme were known, the Senate Intelligence Committee's report provides far more. In its "Findings and Conclusions", for example, the report states: "At least five CIA detainees were subjected to 'rectal rehydration' or rectal feeding without documented medical necessity. The CIA placed detainees in ice water 'baths'. The CIA led several detainees to believe they would never be allowed to leave CIA custody alive, suggesting to one detainee that he would only leave in a coffin-shaped box. One interrogator told another detainee that he would never go to court, because 'we can never let the world know what I have done to you'. CIA officers also threatened at least three detainees with harm to their families - to include threats to harm the children of a detainee, threats to sexually abuse the mother of a detainee, and a threat to 'cut [a detainee's] mother's throat'." There are many more examples. The report states: "The waterboarding technique was physically harmful, inducing convulsions and vomiting. Abu Zubaydah, for example, became 'completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth'. Internal CIA records describe the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Muhammad as evolving into a 'series of near drownings'." In addition, "sleep deprivation involved keeping detainees awake for up to 180 hours", and although some "experienced disturbing hallucinations", in at least two cases the CIA continued its abuse.

Perhaps more importantly, however, the committee also concludes that torture was "not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees", that the CIA made "inaccurate claims" about the "effectiveness" of the programme in an attempt to justify it and that it led to friction with other agencies that endangered national security, as well as providing false statements that led to costly and worthless wild goose chases. The report also concludes that non-approved techniques were used widely, and that "[a]t least 17 detainees were subjected to CIA enhanced interrogation techniques without authorisation from CIA headquarters", and that "multiple detainees were subjected to techniques that were applied in ways that diverged from the specific authorisation, or were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques by interrogators who had not been authorised to use them". The committee was also critical of the central role played by two contract psychologists from the SERE programme, even though neither of them "had any experience as an interrogator, nor did either have specialised knowledge of al-Qaeda, a background in counterterrorism, or any relevant cultural or linguistic expertise". The committee also concluded that Steven Bradbury's numbers were wrong, and that the CIA "detained at least 119 individuals, of whom at least 39 were subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques". Moreover, of these 119 "at least 26 were wrongfully held and did not meet the detention standard" in the still-secret Bush administration memorandum establishing the programme in September 2001. In the days and weeks to come, there will be concerted efforts by the CIA and by former Bush administration officials to defend their actions, but the report makes clear that any kind of defence is untenable. Crimes were committed, authorised at the highest level of the US government, and, although Obama came into office in 2009 expressing "a belief that we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards", that is not acceptable. The Senate Intelligence Committee's torture report - all 6,700 pages of it, costing $40m and involving an analysis of more than six million pages of classified documents - must be the trigger not just for an airing of apologies, but for those who instigated and authorised the torture programme to be held accountable - up to and including President George W Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney.

Trade is linked to the exploitation of vulnerable communities in Africa and Asia, write Costra and Hall [AFP] If you buy ivory, you kill people. This is the new reality in an illicit trade responsible for large-scale human exploitation, government corruption, and the funding of rebel movements, terrorists, and criminal syndicates around the world. The imagery and narrative of the global ivory trade is now well known - replete with rotting elephant carcasses littering African national parks, well-tailored ministers and heads of state burning ivory stocks for the camera, and law enforcement officials smiling in front of ship containers of seized ivory. While, there is no doubt of the many faces of the global ivory trade, there is one element that is too often overlooked - that of the human toll. The human toll of the ivory trade is the negative impact on the individuals and communities exploited along the chain of custody from Africa, to Asia, and points beyond. It is not just about elephants. This trade is historically and inexorably linked to the exploitation and enslavement of vulnerable communities in Africa and Asia. It includes governments and countries sucked deeper into the morass of corruption, mismanagement, and taxpayer abuse wrought from public officials supporting criminal interests. Far reaching implications It includes the lives affected by the introduction of other illegal activities that overlap with the groups and individuals engaged in the ivory trade - including the trafficking of weapons, drugs and humans.

International criminal syndicates, corrupt government officials, and some of the world's most notorious terrorists and militias are fuelling the global trade in illegal ivory. In 2012, an 18-month investigation conducted by the Elephant Action League (EAL) in collaboration with Maisha Consulting, estimated that the Somalia based al-Shabab organisation was drawing up to 40 percent of funds for salaries from ivory smuggling. Other groups like the Seleka rebels in the Central African Republic, the Janjaweed in Sudan and the Lords Resistance Army in central Africa have all been tied to ivory smuggling as a means to raise funding for arms and operations. Further, elements of several regional governments in Africa and Asia have been implicated in facilitating the extraction, trade, and export of ivory for personal profit. The underground ivory supply chain increasingly destabilises already unstable states, and the growth and sophistication of global smuggling networks is outpacing international efforts to stop them. At the same time, the rate of poaching is outpacing the time needed to attempt the behavioural change - in the primarily Asian consumption markets - necessary to stop the demand for it. What that means, is that in conjunction with new innovative awareness campaigns in Asia, more action is needed on the ground in Africa to prevent the negative social, political, and economic impacts that are derivative of the ivory trade. Militarising ivory trade In part, that immediate action must include governments and citizens from western, African, and Asian states facing the responsibilities of addressing the human death and exploitation it perpetuates. Given the increased complexity and militarisation of the trade, new innovative approaches will be required to reduce it. In conjunction with new innovative awareness campaigns in Asia, more action is needed on the ground in Africa to prevent the negative social, political, and economic impacts that are derivative of the ivory trade. PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY This will demand mitigation strategies that occupy a unique space at the nexus of the fields of environmental conservation, public policy, peace and security, counterterrorism, and human rights. While certainly challenging, addressing the trade through the lens of the human toll potentially presents opportunities for the creation of new tools to pressure necessary policymakers and citizens to take additional action. For instance, building the law enforcement and witness protection capacity of affected states around the world. Crowdsourcing information through anonymous whistle-blowing mechanisms like WildLeaks.org has proven incredibly effective, however, there is a gap in the ability of states to protect the individuals providing critical information and act on tip-offs. Informants must know they can be protected and local and international law enforcement must be able to act immediately. The environment of impunity for corrupt state and private sector individuals involved in the trade is also a fundamental barrier to mitigation. Exploring tough sanctions on individuals and states involved in the trade could make the business of ivory more costly for those involved. It was the spike in the value of ivory over the past five years that exacerbated this problem. It will be correlated losses from the cost of doing business that will stop it. In addition to punitive measures, creating public awareness campaigns specifically on the human toll in countries like China and Thailand could go a long way in stemming demand. Showing both governments and consumers in these states that behind every ivory trinket made and sold is a trail of human suffering and exploitation in Africa - something most citizens of those countries are unaware of. Addressing the trade through the human angle requires a multi-faceted approach incorporating all aspects of those impacted. In conjunction with African and Asian partners it affects our collective security, economic development and partnership, and obligation to the protection of human rights and shared history. So while wildlife and wildlife conservation is the traditional medium to approach the issue of poaching and trafficking, it is becoming imperative to develop strategies and campaigns that also put a human face on the destruction and exploitation globally.

Since his ascension to the throne, Vijiralongkorn has demonstrated that power can be waged both by consent and coercion, love and fear. writes Sopranzetti [Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters] On April 6 , King Vajiralongkorn signed Thailand's 20th constitution . Charters have come and gone in the country since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932, often without much woe or jubilation. While the new constitution was met with similar general apathy, the unprecedented journey it went through offers a rare insight into the secretive new reign of King Vajiralongkorn and his developing leadership style. The King ascended to the throne on December 1 , 2016, a month and a half after his father died after seven decades on the throne. As the nation mourned the much-loved monarch, the succession caused anxiety among the Thai people about the future of the institution and doubts over the new monarch's ability to fill his father's shoes. Many saw the new King as an erratic playboy more interested in fast cars, parties, and women than in ruling a country that over the past four decades has turned to his father to arbitrate political conflicts. Since his ascension to the throne, King Vajiralongkorn has proved them wrong. The first four months of his reign have seen a forceful monarch, even more hands-on than his father. Yet, while the late King Bhumibol ruled by inspiring love in his subjects, Vajiralongkorn is starting his reign by instilling fear. King Bhumibol ascended to the throne in 1946 , after the mysterious death of his brother, who was found shot in his room. Initially an irrelevant figurehead controlled by military governments and secluded in his palace in southern Thailand, the young Bhumibol started to travel to rural provinces, support local monks and temples, and establish development projects across the country. These popular enterprises laid the groundwork for the construction of his unprecedented popularity among Thais. Over the following decades, Bhumibol acquired more and more power, cultivating his image as the benevolent and charismatic father of the nation, together with an unprecedented accumulation of wealth and the 1957 introduction of a lese majeste law which punishes anyone who criticises the monarch with three to 15 years in jail. Even with such policies, his dedication to the Thai people remained, until the very end, a largely celebrated feature of his reign. A new style of leadership Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5387709985001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5387709985001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: Thai king endorses military-backed constitution (1:46) The same cannot be said for his son. Vijiralongkorn spent much of his adult life outside the country enjoying a lavish lifestyle in Europe and since his return to the country, he has shown indifference to the crowd-pleasing rituals established by his father. Five weeks after his coronation, on January 9, the new King delivered university degrees to students of Rajabhat University in the northern city of Chiang Mai, a practice established by the late King. Vajiralongkorn kept the students waiting for more than four hours. This was only the first sign of his emerging style of leadership. The following day, Vijiralongkorn demanded changes to a constitutional draft voted on in a popular referendum in August 2016 under a military junta that prevented anti-charter activists and politicians from campaigning. The details of the royal intervention remained unknown during the initial consultations and were disclosed to the public only after the new constitution was promulgated in a royal ceremony on April 6. IN PICTURES: Life of Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej The changes provide the King with complete control over the appointment of a regent in his absence, cancel the need for a parliamentary counter-signature to royal orders, and re-establish royal crisis powers which were taken away from the palace in the 2016 draft, including the ability to impose executive and legislative vetoes and the right to dissolve the legislative assembly. Overall, with the new constitution Vajiralongkorn will wield more power over the parliament than his father ever did. The new king's tighter grip on power has affected not only members of the elites but also commoners. A tighter grip on power Since he took the throne, the new King has imposed tighter control over the palace's inner circles and the powerful figures who ran it under his late father. In the past four months, Vijiralongkorn has stripped more than 40 palace officials of their ranks, with official accusations that go from behaviour unfit for senior bureaucrats to abuses of power for personal profit, from engagement in politics jeopardising national security, disclosing the late King's personal health record to having lost His Majesty's trust. Among those removed from their positions in the palace were two important cases: that of Jumpol Manmai, a former deputy police chief and Grand Chamberlain of the Bureau of the Royal Household in charge of security and special affairs; and that of five members of the Vajarodaya clan , one of the most prominent families in the palace under Vajiralongkorn's father. While the five Vajarodayas were quietly removed from their roles and stripped of their titles, the purging of the former deputy police chief was a much more public business. OPINION: Thailand under the junta - Paranoia and conspiracy Jumpol was fired for undisclosed "extremely evil misconduct" - in the words of the Royal Gazette - and went incommunicado amid rumours about his death, a fate that befell two former members of Vajiralongkorn's inner circles, who died in mysterious circumstances while in detention. A week after his disappearance, Jumpol was accused of land encroachment and appeared in court with his head shaven , a treatment reserved to those who fall out of favour with the new King. His former spouse Princess Srirasmi faced a similar punishment in 2014. After being divorced, Srirasmi was stripped of her titles, shaved, and kept away from the public eye while her parents and four more members of her family were jailed for royal defamation. Fear has spread within prominent families in the country. A source close to the palace who preferred to remain anonymous declared: "People are developing contingency plans, moving money abroad and putting things in place in case the King turns against them."

Jatupat "Pai" Boonpattararaksa, a 25-year-old law student, was arrested and charged with lese majeste the day after Vijiralongkorn's ascension to the throne for sharing a Facebook post of a critical royal biography published by BBC Thailand. The case has been seen as a clear sign of the low tolerance for any public discussion of the new King's past. Since his ascension to the throne, Vijiralongkorn has demonstrated that power can be waged both by consent and coercion, love and fear. If love - shielded by the draconian lese majeste law - defined his father's reign and commanded respect from his subjects, fear will define the son's reign. Whether the new strategy will work remains to be seen, but fear of the new monarch is something the country will have to grapple with. Claudio Sopranzetti is a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford.

Lieutenant-General Manas Kongpaen was convicted on Wednesday of several offences involving trafficking and taking bribes. At least one other defendant considered a kingpin in the illegal trade, Pajjuban Aungkachotephan, was also found guilty. He was a prominent businessman and former politician in the southern province of Satun. By Wednesday evening, 62 people were found guilty, with sentences ranging from four years to the maximum 50 years allowed under the criminal code, officials said. Individual sentences were not immediately announced. READ MORE: Thailand and the daily travail of human trafficking As well as the general, Myanmar nationals, Thai police officers and local politicians are among those accused. Arrests began in 2015 following the discovery of 36 bodies in shallow graves in southern Thailand. That discovery exposed networks which trafficked Rohingya Muslims fleeing persecution in Myanmar and held them for ransom in jungle camps before they were granted passage to Malaysia . The trial began that year, when authorities said traffickers held migrants in the camps as hostages until relatives were able to pay for their release. Many never made it out. The case drew special attention when its lead police investigator, Major-General Paween Pongsirin, fled to Australia and said he feared for his life after his findings implicated "influential people" in Thailand who wanted to silence him. Thailand's military government has said it is making the fight against human trafficking a national priority. Thailand has yet to release a full report on the graves and the results of post-mortem forensic testing. Rights groups say trafficking networks were largely left intact despite the 2015 crackdown and trial [Reuters] Rights groups say trafficking networks were largely left intact by the 2015 crackdown and trial. "We believe that the crackdown is only a disruption of a trafficking network but that network is still very much well in place," said Amy Smith, an executive director of rights group Fortify Rights. Smith also said the current trial has a narrow focus. "We expect there are many more perpetrators out there," she said. "This is a big business with big money." Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher on Thailand at Human Rights Watch , said: "There needs to be more prosecution against traffickers as well as more work on rehabilitation of trafficking victims." Lengthy legal process The legal process in handing down verdicts is lengthy in Thailand, and it may take hours before the judge reveals the exact details of the verdicts to a packed Bangkok court.

Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University, said this trial will serve as a litmus for Thailand’s military government, which is marred by controversies and corruption scandals. "Overall, this case is going to decide whether this government has any lasting legacies or achievements at all and they are putting a lot of emphasis on the trial to show its credibility," he told Al Jazeera, from Bangkok. Thailand's government denies that trafficking syndicates are still flourishing and has said it has largely eliminated human trafficking in the country. Journalists were not allowed in the court room on Wednesday, but proceedings were relayed on television screens provided by the court. Thailand has historically been a source, destination and transit country for men, women and children who are often smuggled and trafficked from poorer, neighbouring countries including Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar to work in Thailand or further afield in Malaysia, often as labourers and sex workers. Mass grave Last month the US state department left Thailand on a Tier 2 Watchlist, just above the lowest ranking of Tier 3, in its annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report because it did not do enough to tackle human smuggling and trafficking. Al Jazeera's Scott Heidler, reporting from Bangkok, said the scale of the trial meant the verdicts would take several hours to read and the hearing could last into tomorrow. "Most [human rights] observers are hoping that there are going to be follow-up cases because they also believe - when you look at this case - we're looking at a very small area; this one mass grave they found along the border in 2015 and one ring that supplied those camps with the people coming across down from Myanmar," he said. "Human rights observers are hoping that this is just the beginning and there will be many more cases to come." All the defendants earlier pleaded not guilty and were placed under pre-trial detention.

The Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University, which has courses catering for the elderly, this year had 199 students who are over 60 [AP] A 91-year old woman in Thailand has earned a college degree after spending more than 10 years studying for it and has received her diploma from the country's king. Public television broadcaster Thai PBS says Kimlan Jinakul was granted the Bachelor of Arts degree in human and family development on Wednesday at the government-run Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University just outside Bangkok. "If we do not study, do not read, do not know, then we won't be able to speak and make sense," she said. Her diploma was handed to her by King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, who took the throne last year. Diplomas at Thailand's public universities are traditionally handed out by members of the royal family. READ MORE: Thousands march for science across India "I am happy and honoured that the king has graciously shown such limitless mercy," Kimlan said, using a phrase meant to show utmost respect to Thai royalty.

"Sometimes she felt weary because of her body," Kimlan's son, Mongkol Jinakul, told Thai PBS. "But we as her children tried to cheer her on and Mom studied until the end and it was a success."

Somchai Wongsawat has not been found guilty by the court over the 2008 incident [Reuters] Two former Thai prime ministers have been cleared of abuse of power in a case involving an anti-government protest in 2008 that turned deadly.

A pitched battle ensued, injuring several hundred people and causing two deaths. A judge said the court could not conclude that the injuries protesters sustained were from police weapons and grenades, according to the AP news agency. Thaksin's brother-in-law Somchai is the brother-in-law of another former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra , whose removal in a 2006 coup triggered sometimes violent battles for political power in Thailand . Thaksin's supporters see the various criminal cases against him and his allies as attempts to erase his influence from Thai political life. Somchai thanked the court after its verdict and said he was grateful there was still justice in the country. Chavalit - who served as premier in the 1990s - did not comment. They could have faced up to 10 years in prison if they had been convicted. The ruling, however, angered a small group of protesters outside the court, some of them participants in the October 2008 protest. One woman shouted: "Let them all get terrible diseases that can't be cured and die painful deaths!" as Somchai walked away. In a separate trial, Thaksin's sister, former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra , declared her innocence and asked for "kindness" from the court that will decide whether she mishandled a rice subsidy programme that allegedly lost billions of dollars. Her bank account has already been frozen after an administrative court held her responsible for some of the losses. The verdict in Yingluck's case is to be issued on August 25.

Yingluck's whereabouts were not immediately known and her absence drove speculation she fled the country. An official of Yingluck's Pheu Thai party, who is close to the Shinawatra family, told The Associated Press she was no longer in Thailand . The official gave no other details and declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject. Yingluck, 50, who became Thailand's first female prime minister when her party swept elections in 2011, is accused of negligence in overseeing a money-losing rice subsidy programme.

The judge said the court did not believe the excuse, however, because no official medical verification was provided. He said a warrant would be issued for her arrest and announced the trial would be postponed until September 27. Norrawit Larlaeng, Yingluck's lawyer, said he had no details on her whereabouts. "I was told this morning that she was ill, that she had vertigo, that she felt dizzy, so I requested the postponement ... That's all I have to say." Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the military chief who engineered the 2014 overthrow of Yingluck's government, said the military government was "looking for her". "If she's not guilty, she should stay and fight the case," Prayuth said. "If she's not here, what does that tell you? Will she still say that she didn't get justice?" Defence Minister Prawit Wongsuwan said security officials monitoring Yingluck had not seen her leave her Bangkok home in the last two days. The trial is the latest chapter in a decade-long struggle by the nation's elite minority to crush the powerful political machine founded by Yingluck's brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, who was toppled in a 2006 coup. Thaksin has lived in Dubai since fleeing a corruption conviction.

"She has definitely left Thailand," one source, who is also a member of her Puea Thai party, told Reuters news agency. The sources did not say where she had gone. Cambodian immigration police said she had not entered their country.

"Up until this point we have no information showing that Yingluck has exited via any of Thailand's border checkpoints," he told Reuters news agency. "I believe she is still in Thailand. If she is found she will be arrested," he said. Yingluck is facing a possible 10-year prison term on charges of negligence linked to an ill-fated rice subsidy programme that cost the state billions of dollars. If convicted, she has the right to appeal. The case is the latest chapter in a decade-long struggle by the nation's elite minority to crush the powerful political machine founded by Yingluck's brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, who was toppled in another coup in 2006. Thaksin's removal triggered years of upheaval and division that has pitted a poor, rural majority in the north that supports the Shinawatras against royalists, the military and their urban backers. The rice subsidies, promised to farmers during the 2011 election, helped Yingluck's party sweep the vote. Critics say they were effectively a means of vote buying, while Yingluck supporters welcomed them and argued that the case against her is politically motivated.

Al Jazeera's Scott Heidler, reporting from Bangkok, said hundreds of Yingluck's supporters gathered outside the Bangkok Supreme Court to await the verdict but were not allowed in the vicinity. "Only media, police and court officials were allowed in this area, normally in the previous court hearings, it was packed with supporters, but this time her supporters are about 200 meters away," he said. "They believe that she is still here and has not fled the country." Some of those gathered held roses while others wore white gloves with the word "love" on them. Supporters of the Shinawatras accuse the ruling generals of political persecution. The military government has acknowledged it wants to maintain permanent influence over future elected governments, partly through a new constitution that took effect earlier this year.

Supporters of Thailand dance outside the Supreme Court after Yingluck failed to show up to hear the verdict [Wason Wanichakorn/AP] Facing a possible 10-year jail term, former Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra fled the country before a court verdict her supporters say was politically motivated, local media and officials said. Yingluck's whereabouts were not immediately known on Saturday. However, anonymous officials told Reuters news agency that she travelled by land to Cambodia then flew to Dubai to join her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra - another exiled former premier whose government, like hers, was toppled in a military coup. READ MORE: Thailand - Deep divisions remain since 2014 military coup An official of Yingluck's Pheu Thai party close to the Shinawatra family, meanwhile, told The Associated Press she was no longer in Thailand , without giving further details. Yingluck, who became Thailand's first female prime minister when her party swept elections in 2011, is accused of negligence in overseeing a money-losing rice subsidy programme. She has denied charges as politically motivated. No-show A verdict had been expected on Friday, as thousands of Yingluck supporters gathered outside the court and thousands of police stood guard. But Yingluck never appeared. A judge read out a statement saying her lawyers had informed the court she could not attend because of an earache. The judge said the court did not believe the excuse, however, because no official medical verification was provided. He said a warrant would be issued for her arrest and postponed the trial until September 27. Norrawit Larlaeng, Yingluck's lawyer, confirmed a warrant had been issued, but said he had no details on her whereabouts. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the military chief who engineered the 2014 overthrow of Yingluck's government, also said he did not know where she was, and the government was " looking for her ". "If she's not guilty she should stay and fight the case," Prayuth said. "If she's not here, what does that tell you? Will she still say that she didn't get justice?" READ MORE: Thailand's revolving door elites The long-awaited decision on Yingluck's fate has rekindled tensions in the divided nation, but the military remains firmly in charge. The rice subsidies, promised to farmers during the 2011 election, helped Yingluck's party ascend to power. Critics say they were effectively a means of vote-buying, while Yingluck supporters welcomed them. The rice subsidy plan Yingluck oversaw paid farmers about 50 percent more than they would have made on the world market. The hope was to drive up prices by stockpiling the grain, but other Asian producers filled the void instead, knocking Thailand from its perch as the world's leading rice exporter. The current government, which is still trying to sell off the rice stockpiles, says Yingluck's administration lost as much as $17bn because it could not export at a price commensurate with what it had paid farmers. If convicted, Yingluck has the right to appeal.

RenderPagesVideo('5589088589001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Bangkok - A verdict is expected in the corruption case against a former Thai prime minister on Wednesday, but it appears she will not be there to hear it. Yingluck Shinawatra has already been absent for the court ruling and it is believed that she is in hiding overseas. On Tuesday, Thailand's junta leader Prayuth Chan-o-cha said he knows where Yingluck is, but will not disclose her location until after a verdict is delivered in her negligence trial. "I know, but I won't say yet," Prayuth, who toppled Yingluck's government in a May 2014 coup, said after a weekly cabinet meeting. "I'll tell you where she is after September 27. I have spies." INSIDE STORY: Is it the end for Thailand's Shinawatra dynasty? (24:30) Prayuth said that to his knowledge, Yingluck has not sought asylum abroad. Yingluck disappeared from Thailand shortly before a Supreme Court verdict scheduled on August 25. Her lawyer said she was ill with an ear problem and could not appear in court. Yingluck, who was active on social media, has not commented publicly since disappearing from public view last month. Her Puea Thai Party has said that it does not know where Yingluck is. Location speculation Reuters news agency reported in August that she had fled to Dubai where her brother and former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, has a home and lives in self-imposed exile to avoid a 2008 jail sentence for corruption. Thai authorities investigating how she escaped said last week they have questioned three police officers who admitted to helping Yingluck flee. The junta has denied any prior knowledge of Yingluck's plan to escape. But many in the kingdom find that difficult to believe given the tight security net and constant surveillance of Yingluck. Analysts said Yingluck most probably brokered a deal with the military leaders, who would have been eager to see off a popular politician poised to become a democracy martyr. If convicted, Yingluck faces a jail term of up to 10 years and a lifetime ban from politics. SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Asia Pacific Thailand Politics
Former Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has been charged with corruption over a rice subsidy case [Reuters] Thailand 's Supreme Court finds former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra guilty of negligence in a rice subsidy case, sentencing her in absentia to five years in jail. "The court found that the defendant is guilty as charged ... the court has sentenced her to five years in prison and the court also unanimously agreed that the sentence will not be suspended," the judge said. Al Jazeera's Wayne Hay in Bangkok said that it took the nine Supreme Court judges four hours to read the verdict. The maximum penalty for this negligence act is 10 years in jail, and the judges did not offer an explanation for why Yingluck was sentenced to five years. "The overriding theme of this charge and ultimate conviction is that she did not benefit from the corrupt activities involved in this rice-pledging scheme directly," Hay said. Sommai Koosap, lawyer of former Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, speaks to the media as he arrives at the Supreme Court in Bangkok [Reuters] Yingluck has not attended court hearings, and it is believed that she has been in hiding overseas for a month. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters before the verdict that he knew where Yingluck was but would not give more details. Yingluck's elected government was toppled in a 2014 coup, and she faces up to a decade in jail for negligence over mismanaging a rice subsidy scheme that pumped cash into her family's rural base in the northeast. Authorities say that this caused the country $8bn in financial losses. The Supreme Court ruling was supposed to be read on August 25, but the 50-year-old failed to show up, stunning thousands of supporters who had gathered outside.

The military, which took power in a 2014 coup, has repeatedly delayed elections [Narong Sangnak/EPA] Thailand 's military government says it will hold a general election in November 2018 after repeatedly delaying the decision, citing concerns such as changes to the constitution and security issues, since taking power in a 2014 coup. The exact election date would be announced in June 2018, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the head of the ruling military government or National Council for Peace and Order, told reporters on Tuesday at Bangkok's Government House. "Around June, we will announce the date for the next election," he said. The decision comes more than a year after Prayut's initial promise to hold elections this year. Thailand's last general election was in 2011. The European Union and the United States - both key allies – had been pressuring Prayut to hold elections and lift restrictions on civil liberties imposed since his takeover. Last year, the military pushed through a new constitution that critics said would boost military power and limit the sway of elected officials. A divided nation The military claimed the new charter, Thailand's 20th, will purge Thailand of corrupt civilian politicians and restore stability after nearly a decade of political turmoil including two coups. The country has been bitterly divided ever since a 2006 coup that toppled Thaksin Shinawatra as prime minister. Years of competing protests and instability followed. In 2014, the army seized power once more, toppling Thaksin's sister, Yingluck. The Shinawatra clan has won all general elections since 2001, harvesting votes by promising greater wealth and opportunity to the rural poor. But the family is loathed by an arch-royalist Bangkok elite which is backed by the military, and by southern voters who accuse the Shinawatras of corruption and populism. Last month, Yingluck was sentenced in absentia to five years in jail after she was found guilty of negligence in a rice subsidy case. SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Asia Pacific Thailand

RenderPagesVideo('5614415380001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); London - If you want to run one of the UK 's 100 largest companies you have a better chance if your name is David than if you are a woman. (Eight Davids, six women.) For more than 30 years, women have been trying to make inroads into top management with few results. Now there is a game-changer: women "returnships" - high-level, paid internships to get experienced, skilled women back into work after raising a family or looking after elderly parents. ''The majority of people who step out of organisations don't do it with the intention of leaving permanently,'' said Julianne Miles, who co-founded Women Returners , an organisation that has helped hundreds of women find jobs. ''They think I'll take a break for a few years and then I'll go back. Sometimes a few years turns into five years, 10 years, and the more amount of time that goes on the more challenging it is to get back in.'' Miles said a number of factors - external and internal - keep women from going back. Companies see gaps in CVs and see risk; the women often need flexible hours; and many lose their self-confidence and professional identity, writing themselves off as 'just mothers'. Henrietta Gibb is back at work after taking a 12-year break from the corporate world to raise three children. She applied to more than 30 companies before getting an internship at Tideway, the company building a new sewage system for London. ''I felt quite confident but then when I sat down for the interview I suddenly thought: 'Oh my goodness! What am I doing? Am I going to be able to answer these questions properly? I think that's a natural way to feel probably when you're suddenly back in that situation,'' said Gibb, Tideway's creative services manager. Looking out on a muddy construction site along the River Thames as orange bulldozers, dump trucks with flashing lights, diggers and forklifts rumble by, Gibb said it took some adjusting to full-time work. Her 11-year-old daughter is ''old enough to know I'm not there".' ''During the summer holidays she'd text: 'when are you going to be home?' and 'what are you cooking for dinner?','' Gibb said. Parenting skills such as multi-tasking and crisis management, Gibb said, can transfer to the office. Many companies agree and welcome the return of experienced women. ''They come in and they are extremely valued members of staff and help move through the organisation and get promoted along the way,'' said Julie Thornton, human resources manager for Tideway. The construction company sees the returnships as a way to address its gender gap; only 10 percent of employees are women. But what does Thornton say to the man who has never taken a career break, doesn't ask for flexible working hours and resents the woman now sitting next to him, who may be promoted over him. ''We know that organisations are more effective, more efficient, more productive when they have a balance of individuals whether that's gender, whether that's race, et cetera,'' Thornton said. ''For me it's about actually embracing that difference and actually there is opportunity for all people and we should embrace that and make sure all people have the career path they are looking for. But we shouldn't exclude because they've taken care and responsibility of people and taken time out of work,'' Thornton said. Julie Thornton [Sam Gracey/Al Jazeera] It makes economic sense: the annual affect that women out of the workforce (or those working below their skills) has on the UK economy is 1.78bn pounds ($2.37bn). There are a number of organisations, such as Women Returners, helping women get back to work. In the US, iRelaunch and Moms Corp have found jobs for countless women. And the movement is growing: Women Returners has expanded to Ireland and has had queries from grassroots organisations in Costa Rica , Taiwan , South Korea and Australia . Many elements have converged to make these returnships a viable, accepted form of recruitment: women at home are an untapped resource; careers are longer so it makes sense for women to go back to work in their mid-30s or 40s; and it's a given that diversity strengthens companies. But it's hard to underestimate the confidence women who've been out of work need to summon just to apply for a job - they feel their skills are outdated. They wonder how they will cope with new technology and fear they won't fit in - even regarding their appearance. Miles said one of their most popular blogs is "what to wear to work". ''Before I started I spoke to one of the women returners and I said: 'I'm really worried what I wear' and on the women returners' blog it says 'sometimes you can go stand outside the company and watch what people are wearing'. I know that every company, every organisation, has its own culture about what they wear,'' Gibb said. In the end, Gibb didn't feel the need to lurk outside Tideway and opted for ''basic'' attire. On the day we met, she was wearing black trousers, a white shirt and a black windbreaker with Tideway written in turquoise.

The late Jon Underwood, founder of the Death Cafe. [Photo courtesy of Susan Barsky Reid]- "People eat a lot more at a funeral than they do at a wedding … death has a beautiful quality about it that just helps people live," said Jon Underwood at a seminar , two years after his creation, the Death Cafe, was born. The very first cafe was hosted in Underwood's basement in the London borough of Hackney, bringing together mostly friends and acquaintances to trial the idea that talking about death can benefit the living. Tea and cake - a vital part of any Death Cafe, fostering a sense of comfort and safety - were served, and Susan Barsky Reid, Underwood's mother, facilitated the event. A psychotherapist by trade, Barsky Reid remembers the 2011 event as experimental and, eventually, cathartic for the participants. "It was the 25th of September, was a bit cool. We had a fire, and we organised it very minutely because we had no idea what was going to happen. And so we had exercises; we had people's ideas ... we were going to burn them in the fire. Write them down and burn them. "We did all of this stuff, but it became very apparent that people just wanted the opportunity to talk ... to talk about death because in society, in British society anyway, people don't find it comfortable to talk about death ... And so we came to the conclusion after the first one that we didn't need to have a structure other than to say, we are here to talk about death and dying. That is usually enough to get people talking." Inspired by the work of Swiss anthropologist Bernard Crettaz, the social franchise took off internationally. Thousands of cafes have reportedly taken place across 51 countries since 2011, with current listings in the US, Japan, Australia, South Africa, Spain and Germany, among other places. Crettaz had paved the way for Death Cafe with his own "cafe mortel" in Switzerland years before, hoping to break the taboo surrounding death. The first of his cafes was held in the Swiss town of Neuchatel in 2004. In October 2014, in a room set out with chairs and tables, laden with wine and nuts, Crettaz hosted his final get-together, putting an end to his long-held fantasy that he would die during a cafe mortel. Josefine Speyer, is also a psychotherapist and the cofounder of the Natural Death Centre , a charity based in Winchester, England, giving advice on "all aspects of dying". Speyer has been one of the most regular hosts of Death Cafes in London. "I see Death Cafe as another wave in the natural death movement, where death is a natural part of life," says her profile on the Death Cafe website. "We can talk openly and honestly about issues of dying and death as a normal part of conversation. That is also a way we can create a more compassionate society, where we realise we are all in the same boat, we are all mortal, and life and the planet we live on is precious." 'Just being alongside somebody is enough' Barsky Reid reiterates this point in discussing why Underwood, while volunteering at a hospice, had started the Death Cafe movement. "I think his feeling was mostly helplessness. That there wasn't a lot that he could do to help people but what we all needed to realise is that, actually, just being alongside somebody is enough. Just to have a companion. "I remember him telling me that once he explained to people that he was a Buddhist - and Buddhists are mindful that they're going to die - as a volunteer, and one of the people in the hospice asked him to do some chanting. I can remember him telling me. So he did some chanting of their mantras or prayers. I think he enjoyed doing that." But it's not only the terminally ill or the elderly who have questions about death. On the contrary, young people are frequently seen at the Death Cafes, with a notable female majority. Barsky Reid puts this down to modern day advertising and how comfortable people are with being vulnerable. "I would say 75 percent are women," says Barsky Reid. "And quite a few, at the beginning particularly, were young. I think because it was spread through the internet and that it seems to be that, certainly younger people, seemed more able to use social media and a lot of it [Death Cafe advertising] was spread that way. You got younger people coming. And I think women are more open to talking about feelings than the men. I can think of one Death Cafe where there were no men at all." In July of this year, Underwood suffered a fatal brain haemorrhage, triggered by undiagnosed acute promyelocytic leukaemia. He was 44. Barsky Reid says she doesn't see her son's creation as something that can help her overcome his death. "Nothing can help with your child dying before you do. The world isn't as lovely a place for me now as it was when he was in it." Does death scare someone who has experienced it so closely in both a personal and social context? "I don't know because I haven't had to face my own death. Obviously, I'm dying, like everybody, but you know, I'm well at the moment. I don't at this moment feel afraid of what it could be. I was there when Jon died and when my parents died. And, none of those deaths were scary. Maybe I've been lucky but nobody was in pain or screaming, they were all peaceful." Barsky Reid and Underwood's sister, Jools Barsky, have committed to keeping his vision alive. The Death Cafe community remains active online.

Palestinians take part in a protest calling on Britain to apologise for the Balfour Declaration, in the West Bank city of Ramallah on October 18, 2017 [Mohamad Torokman/Reuters] We live in a dangerous world. This is the reality in which Prime Minister Theresa May wants to carve out a future as a "truly global Britain" after Brexit to "reach beyond the borders of Europe" and play an even more international role. But surviving in a dangerous world - let alone doing any good for yourself or others - requires the ability to learn from the mistakes of the past, stop repeating them and live up to the promises you made. The centenary of the Balfour Declaration on November 2 should provide an ideal opportunity for reflection, learning and action. The Palestinian conflict shares something in common with a number of other, seemingly unrelated conflicts, such as Kashmir and Myanmar - a legacy of British colonialism. There's no hope of a "truly global Britain" unless the country addresses that, helps to start clearing up the mess it made, and does something to defend those it said it would defend. Recent British prime ministers, including David Cameron and Tony Blair, have offered vague admissions of British culpability when addressing receptive international audiences, but none of these have been sincere apologies, nor have they been followed up with any robust actions to help resolve and ease the situations caused by their predecessors. The "divide and rule" tactic employed by British colonialism around the world, as well as the violent attempts to curb opposition to its rule and regain independence, have left a deep imprint that is still felt to this day. {articleGUID} Yet, far from reflecting on the grave consequences of British colonialism, Prime Minister Theresa May will be doing entirely the opposite by celebrating the centenary of the Balfour Declaration at an elegant London location, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and 150 carefully selected VIP guests. What about the promise made in the Declaration that "nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine"? Britain needs to start living up to that, at last. And what's to celebrate? Perhaps retrospectively, the Declaration enables Europeans to feel better about the horrific murder of six million Jews in Europe during World War II - events which took place 20 years after the original Balfour Declaration. The commitment "to view with favour the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people" even seems noble from this perspective, and easily distracts from the reality of the use of brutal violence to honour it. British politicians recognised early on that force would be necessary to remove the Palestinian Arab Christians and Muslims who formed over 90 percent of the population, and who were not consulted about promises made about their land by the British. Winston Churchill was concerned about the financial burden on British taxpayers' money as he knew British troops would need to be deployed. It is heartening that despite the collective amnesia encouraged by our leaders, education system, and the dominant media discourse, ordinary British citizens are awakening to the catastrophic actions that were taken in this country\'s name and are calling for Britain to acknowledge its responsibilities. So should Britain really be celebrating the Balfour Declaration, which has resulted in unimaginable misery, death and destruction faced by the Palestinians for the past 100 years? The 67-word declaration made 100 years ago in the throes of World War I by a British parliamentarian continues to be the raison d'etre for much misery and trouble in the region. And the ongoing misery caused by British colonialism is not limited to Palestine. Britain's bloody footprints around the world In August, India and Pakistan celebrated the 70th anniversary of their creation as part of independence from the British Empire, which had ruled India for 200 years. Fifteen million people were uprooted and between one and two million people died. {articleGUID} The task of partitioning the country was given to Sir Cyril Radcliffe, a lawyer who had never been there. He drew lines that split apart communities and families, destroying centuries of tradition in one foul swoop of his pen across the country, not unlike the effect of Balfour's pen in the Middle East. Death and destruction inevitably followed such a crude and thoughtless division, with India and Pakistan going to war over the territory of Kashmir almost immediately, an issue still unresolved to this day. Indeed, the very first UN resolution in 1948 refers to the right of Kashmiris for self-determination through a vote. Yet Britain has done very little to uphold that commitment, and Kashmir continues to be a symbol of instability in the region. Myanmar also gained independence from Britain in 1948, and the genocide that is currently being carried out there by Buddhist nationalists has forced nearly half a million Rohingya Muslims to flee their burning villages to escape rape, murder and violence. This genocide can also be traced back to British colonial policies, and yet the UK government's voice has barely been heard. Of all the countries that should be playing a role in protecting the vulnerable Muslim minority in Myanmar, the UK should be leading efforts , as blame for the conflict is very easily traceable back to British colonial times. The Rohingya have been living in those lands for over two hundred years, but resentment over the internal displacement of Buddhists stems back to 1826 when Britain annexed the part of Myanmar where most Rohingya Muslims live today. Indian Muslims were brought in large numbers to become labourers and administrators for the British, but, like other places in the world, it is not the colonists who are paying the price for this, but ordinary innocent people. {articleGUID} Seventy years ago saw the breakup of the British Empire. Now, as Brexit is breaking our ties with Europe and we are looking to build partnerships with the rest of the world, the centenary of the Balfour Declaration provides an ideal opportunity for reflection, learning and meaningful action to address the historic, underlying, unjust British policies that are at the root of ongoing conflict. It is heartening that despite the collective amnesia encouraged by our leaders, education system, and the dominant media discourse, ordinary British citizens are awakening to the catastrophic actions that were taken in this country's name and are calling for Britain to acknowledge its responsibilities. To this end, a national rally is being organised on Saturday, November 4 in London with the theme "Make it Right for Palestine," and thousands are expected to attend. It promises to be a very different marking of the Balfour Declaration than the one Theresa May is attending, being open, inclusive and public. And it serves as a reminder that Britain's imperial dreams continue to be a living nightmare for thousands across the world.

Nowhere is May's inability to lead more obvious than in her naivete about Donald Trump, and trade, writes Sloan [Reuters] Theresa May celebrated her sixty-first birthday on Sunday. A video appeared of her supporters giving the British premier a rendition of Happy Birthday described even by a supportive newspaper as "excruciating". It was filmed on the first day of her Conservative party's annual conference. Her keynote speech went badly - a prankster handing her a fake dismissal notice to the delight of the attendant media - the branded sign behind her promising a better Britain collapsed, and a painfully embarrassing dry throat and persistent cough betrayed her nervousness.

Insiders claimed she was "on the edge of breakdown" under the pressure of Brexit , combined with dashing around the world trying to secure replacement trade deals. Party insiders have suggested up to four in five of her MPs may have stayed away from the annual conference. At a time when Britain needs energetic leadership more than most, Number Ten has a decidedly average tenant. Nowhere is May's inability to lead more obvious than in her naivete about Donald Trump and trade. Egged on by anti-European hardliners, she has hoped to tempt Trump into a dazzling new commercial arrangement now Britain is outside the European Union . Not only has she offered him a highly controversial state visit, but has been deliberately slow to criticise his bigoted approach to Muslims, and favourable overtones towards neo-Nazis. All the flattery now appears to have been for nothing. May's terrible birthday was rounded off with news of a new trade war, instead of a trade deal, with the United States . The US Department of Commerce accused aviation firm Bombardier of receiving too much state aid from the Canadian and British governments, and have suddenly levied a 219 percent tariff against a significant part of their business. READ MORE: Lee Nelson pranks PM Theresa May with P45 stunt Bombardier may be Canadian - but some four thousand Northern Irish jobs are now at risk - because the wings for the planes are made in an enormous factory in Belfast, upon which much of the Northern Irish economy relies. Worse still, both sides of the peace process have said the fragile truce is now at risk. The move even threatens the stability of the Westminster government, because the factory lies in the heartland of the Democrat Unionist Party, currently in coalition with May's Conservative Party. What makes the move so striking is that the Boeing-Bombardier animosity is nothing new; these kinds of struggles have gone on for decades , but normally without such punitive consequences. No doubt the allure of a protectionist president in the White House, and a weak United Kingdom outside of the EU, has emboldened the Boeing lawyers. Thousands of jobs, peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland, the stability of her own government, and the future of the UK, are now all at risk. May has threatened retaliatory tactics are now on the way, as it becomes clear that Trump has duped her. The sway Britain has with the US is over-estimated though, by both her and the Brexiteers crowing to get out of Europe, too many of whom she has welcomed into senior cabinet positions. When May flew across the Atlantic to meet Trump this time last year to kick off trade talks, Trump duly nodded along, but no American newspaper gave May a front-page splash. Instead, the glory of New York Times, Chicago Tribune and Washington Post front pages fell to Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto, who was visiting Trump at the same time. The fifth largest economy in the world had been deemed less important than the fifteenth . How could this be? Although Trump's anti-Mexican policies made the Nieto visit perhaps a sexier story, trade figures also explained the discrepancy. American annual trade in goods and services with Mexico comes to an estimated $579.7bn , making them the country's third most important trade partner. Meanwhile, UK annual trade comes to only $100bn. Mexico being Trump America's third biggest trade partner hasn't stopped him threatening trade wars against them though, just as Canada being his second biggest hasn't stopped him levying the Bombardier tariffs, just as China being the US's largest foreign trade partner hasn't stopped isolationist Trump declaring trade war against Beijing. If Trump is prepared to declare trade wars on top partners like those then, why would he hesitate to declare war on Britain too? Only last month he announced plans to withdraw from a free trade deal with South Korea , an economy with which the US trades roughly the same as Britain, and the Bombardier tariffs look like empirical evidence his priority really is "America First".

A trade war would be threatened, but even Trump might not make good on it. The combined gross domestic product (GDP) of the EU is after all equal to that of the US, and the EU has a far larger population, which matters when it comes to trade. Brexiteers need a wake-up call too then - Trump tariffs are what life outside the EU really looks like. Putting their faith in Trump was folly. When the new president said "America First" - it turns out he meant it. May listening to them was equally stupid. After all, the challenges presented by the Bombardier tariffs are only a taste of things to come. On Thursday, Trump indicated he would oppose a new UK-EU agricultural deal, in a move designed not to hold the UK's hand, but to force it, and exploit the UK as it leaves the EU. There is time for May to turn this tariff disaster around though - the US Department of Commerce still needs to take a final decision, and they likely wouldn't be fully imposed until February. The real question is whether she has it in her to take on Trump, Brexit, or anything else. Nothing about her premiership so far has suggested she does. Perhaps those plotting to remove her might get on with it. Thousands of jobs, peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland, the stability of her own government, and the future of the UK, are now all at risk.

UK's Terrorism Act 2000 has been highly contested and criticised since its introduction seventeen years ago [Reuters] Last week, at the Conservative Party Conference , Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced that the UK government intends to increase jail time for viewing content or possessing information useful to somebody preparing terrorism from 10 to 15 years. This may seem like an appropriate policy given the recent spate of terrorist attacks in the UK, but reading between the lines, it is anything but appropriate. The proposals, if followed through, will be introduced under the Section 58 of the Terrorism Act . This offence was initially introduced 17 years ago under the Terrorism Act 2000 . It criminalises the possession or collection of "information … likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism". This is a very broad power that can criminalise a whole host of information and this is why the Court of Appeal ruled that the offence would only be applicable to "information that would typically be of use to terrorists, as opposed to ordinary members of the population". The offence, in other words, was created as a way of criminalising information such as target lists concerning the armed forces or police officers, as well as things such as tactical bomb-making and military manuals, for example. OPINION: It's official - Defending torture victims is terrorism While this appears entirely reasonable and fair, there is one serious problem with Section 58. The offence ignores the reason why a person holds or views such information or what they intend to use it for. Simply put, the reason why you possessed a military training manual or a list of soldiers is irrelevant for the purposes of this law. It is the nature of the information that is a crime; not the intention of the person who views or possesses the information. In practice, this means that a student studying terrorist groups, an academic writing a book on armed movements, or a journalist reporting on military personnel could potentially find themselves facing arrest, charge, and prosecution for terrorism, if they are found viewing or holding such information. The way ahead in generating security is not by strengthening the state of exception that violates and undermines due process, but rather, dismantling a legal infrastructure that can be used to lock you away - for what could soon be 15 years - without ever having to prove you intended to commit terrorism. Of course, the section 58 offence formally includes the "defence" of "reasonable excuse". In simple terms, this means that if you are found viewing or possessing information useful to terrorists, you can defend your actions on the ground that it's related to your studies, your research, your journalism, and so forth, and not, therefore, be charged with terrorism. This sounds fair but a key aspect is omitted from this point. A defence will only realistically be required once a person is either being questioned under police caution (ie, they are being assessed whether they are actually involved in terrorism) or once they are formally under arrest for suspected terrorism. The defence, in other words, can only be made once a coercive form of action has been initiated against a person; any person. Once a defence has been offered, the police and prosecutors will work to determine whether they should prosecute them or terminate the investigation. Such a decision is, of course, subject to official guidelines which are based on determining whether there is a realistic prospect of a conviction and whether a prosecution is in the "public interest". However, like any guidance, there is an element of elasticity involved in interpreting it; not to forget the political pressure and political context involved in such decision-making. One need look no further than the refusal of prosecutors to bring even one case against police officers for more than 1,500 deaths that have occurred in police custody since 1990, to understand the politicised environment within which prosecutors act. While the law may, therefore, be represented as being a neutral arbiter that sits above politics, in its application, it operates within a political context and reflects power structures and the biases of those who create and wield it. The law, in other words, is more about power than it is about justice. It is precisely this understanding that can prompt individuals and institutions to self-discipline and censor their ideas, behaviours, and activities. A poignant example of this concerns the British Library who refused to stock an archive of primary documents related to the Taliban due to legitimate anxieties that they might face prosecution under terrorism laws which criminalise the holding or sharing of information that encourages or "glorifies" terrorism. OPINION: The activist taking on the UK's invasive 'terror laws' Why? Because irrespective of the reason for sharing or holding such information, one is theoretically breaking the law. This is, of course, no isolated example. My own false arrest and detention for seven days under the Terrorism Act for possessing the al-Qaeda training manual that was downloaded from a US government website for postgraduate research on armed Islamic groups is one relatively well-known case. Another concerns the journalist Shiv Malik being forced under counterterrorism powers to disclose notes from his conversations with a source who was speaking to him in connection with his book. Then, there was the case of the Birmingham bookseller who was prosecuted (and later acquitted) for disseminating political Islamic books that the appeal court said could not be proven to be encouraging terrorism. Most recently, the BBC Newsnight journalist Secunder Kermani was forced to hand over his laptop to counterterrorism police after being in communication with a fighter in Syria .

(25:00) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY While terrorism laws are only ever meant to be used against "terrorists", when the state acquires exceptional and draconian powers that disregard criminal intent, the temptation to use them, as these cases demonstrate, becomes ever so stronger. The home secretary's latest announcement may be perceived as just another counterterrorism proposal, but in professions such as journalism and academia, where terrorist materials often need to be scrutinized, consulted, and studied, this will be seen as yet another move by a government committed to further strengthening and reinvigorating the long arm of the security state at the expense of understanding and confronting the drivers of terrorism. The way ahead in generating security is not by strengthening the state of exception that violates and undermines due process, but rather, dismantling a legal infrastructure that can be used to lock you away - for what could soon be 15 years - without ever having to prove you intended to commit terrorism.

From left: Arry Neesa, Adamah Jumah and Samayya Afzal [Al Jazeera] London, England - Anti-Muslim attacks in the UK rose 47 percent in 2016 compared with the previous year, according to a new report released by Tell MAMA, a hate crime monitor. The attacks were largely levelled at Muslim women - 56 percent of victims of 642 incidents were female. Sixty-six percent of perpetrators were male, and 69 percent were white men. Victims came from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. Although not all Muslim women wear clothing that identifies them as followers of the Islamic faith, those who don the headscarf, face veil, robe and other garments are disproportionately targeted of gendered Islamophobia , said the report, which was released on Thursday. {articleGUID} Coming from an ethnic minority background, being female and Muslim has created a brand of Islamophobia with an "intersectional nature", crossing boundaries of gender, race and religion, Tell MAMA said. In the week following the EU referendum vote, the charity reported a 475 percent spike in anti-Muslim attacks, a jump also witnessed after the Tower Bridge attacks . "One major driver of Islamophobia is the way certain sections of the media have reported on Muslims," Miqdaad Versi, assistant general of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), told Al Jazeera. "When commentators use terms like 'The Muslim Problem', it reinforces this narrative and all the differences that have been identified which perpetuate stereotypes and reify the good/bad Muslim dichotomy. That way it's much easier to believe it is acceptable to treat them differently." {articleGUID} Events that lead to Muslims being portrayed as "the problem", include attacks and an ongoing discussion on halal meat being branded as animal cruelty. "[This] has created this idea that Muslims are the 'other'. The government needs to take serious action to tackle hate crime against all communities in an equal and proportionate manner, which as it stands right now, is not the case," Versi said. Al Jazeera spoke to victims about their experiences: Adamah Jumah, 27, London "Growing up, I never felt Islamophobia was the norm. You heard about something happening to someone after an attack, and that was it. But my experiences of late have forced me to change my opinion, because the truth is, anti-Muslim attacks have now become normal. I remember going to an event in broad daylight during the summer. I was approaching the venue and this guy, who I remember looked quite mature and was very drunk, came towards me. There was a bus stop in front of me with people gearing to go home. He approached me and said: 'I hate the fact that you Muslims are in this country.' At first, I was really shocked, because he approached me in a really aggressive way, so I crossed the road for my own safety. I said to him: 'Get out of my way.' I wasn't having any of it. I shouted back: 'I was born in this country, so how about that?' Then he started to make monkey noises Adamah Jumah All the while, the people at the bus stop were just standing there watching to see what was going on. Then the man started shouting obscene language and abuse, telling me to 'go back to my own country'. I shouted back: 'I was born in this country, so how about that?' Then he started to make monkey noises. I eventually went inside the venue, I tried to act like I was OK, I was cool. He was just a drunk guy, he didn't do me any harm. But a few minutes later, I was really shaking inside. I think I underestimated how frightening it was to be approached like that, to the point that someone approached me and asked if I was OK. I said I was fine, but inside, I wasn't." Samayya Afzal, 26, Bradford "A couple of days after Trump was elected, I was walking in the city centre of Bradford with a group of friends. We were behind two men, one of whom was clearly drunk. He turned around and started shouting things like: 'Go home Pakis!' He kept turning around spouting racist abuse, but we ignored him. When he realised we were ignoring him, he said: 'Do you want me to pull out my Stanley knife?' He said: 'Do you want me to pull out my Stanley knife?' He put his hand in his pocket as though he was going to get something, and started to approach us Samayya Afzal He put his hand in his pocket as though he was going to get something, and started to approach us but his friend grabbed him and dragged him away from us. At that moment, we had no idea if he had a knife or not, so we turned a corner and went into a local cafe to regroup. When you're in Bradford as a minority and a Muslim, you expect it to be safe because you're surrounded by people that look like you. We were a big group, too, so we thought that would protect us even though most of us were visibly Muslim, but it didn't." Arry Neesa, 36, Prestwich "A few weeks after the EU referendum, I was walking my son to school along a route I always take. A gentleman I walked past said something to me. I thought he was asking for a lighter for his cigarette, so I told him I don't smoke. He looked at me really funny and said: 'What are you doing here? Shouldn't you go back home?' So I replied: 'I'm British. I was born here, this is my home!' I gave him a history lesson and told him my grandfather fought for this country. Then he said: 'Well if this is your home, we voted you out. So why are you still here?' He said: 'Well if this is your home, we voted you out. So why are you still here?' In the space of two seconds, it went from that to him trying to punch my son Arry Neesa In the space of two seconds, it went from that to him trying to punch my son who he thought was an easy target. I was a normal person who had walked down this road a hundred times, but in the space of a few weeks, this man now felt like he had the right to point out that I no longer belonged in this country. I don't wear a hijab [headscarf], but the fact is he associated my being brown, being Asian, with being Muslim. In the same week, someone plastered a sticker exclusively on my front door, not on any other doors in the neighbourhood, saying: 'Join us. Follow the Pegida movement.' Instead of 'Refugee Muslims, it said 'Rapefugee Muslims'. For the first time in my life, I was made to feel that I wasn't British; I was Muslim." Muraad Chaudhry, 22, London "Soon after the Paris attacks and the Bataclan shooting, I was sat on the District Line tube on the way to work. There was this old lady who must have been in her 70s or 80s who was standing, so I decided to offer her my seat. As I got up and gestured to her, asking her if she wanted to sit down, she screamed and said she didn't want to take a seat from a 'terrorist like me' Muraad Chaudhury As I got up and gestured to her, asking her if she wanted to sit down, she screamed and said she didn't want to take a seat from a 'terrorist like me' . The people around her were taken aback. One woman stood up and said: 'No, that's out of order. You shouldn't say things like that about this nice young man who is offering you a seat.' I felt shocked and embarrassed because I'd never experienced anything like that before, so I decided to get off at the next station."

The Guy Fawkes mask has become associated with the Anonymous movement [File: Ivan Alvarado/Reuters] Thousands are expected to descend on London's Trafalgar Square to attend the Million Mask March. What is the Million Mask March? Associated with the hacktivist group Anonymous, Million Mask March protesters worldwide have rallied every year since 2013 against militarisation and police brutality and for self-governance. In a 27-minute message posted to YouTube ahead of the 2017 event, Anonymous said: "Every November 5, the Million Mask March is a sign that humanity around the world is crying out for change." Protesters usually wear masks depicting Guy Fawkes. Who was Guy Fawkes? Guy Fawkes, also known as Guido Fawkes, was a member of the English Catholics who planned the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The group wanted to blow up the House of Lords, but ultimately failed. Guy Fawkes and three other plotters were hanged and quartered on January 31, 1606. Guy Fawkes Night is celebrated across Britain, with revellers setting off fireworks and burning a Guy Fawkes effigy on a bonfire. The festival, which had Protestant spirit, started as a way to give thanks because the Gunpowder Plot failed, but later fuelled anti-Catholic bigotry. When will the Million Mask March take place? The main march is expected to take place on Sunday, November 5 at 6pm (18:00GMT) at Trafalgar Square in central London. The annual event coincides with Guy Fawkes Night. Police have said the march must end by 9pm. There is also an event planned in Barcelona, according to social media. Is violence expected at Sunday's rally? Thousands usually take part in the march and there is usually some disruption. Last year, dozens were arrested. Police have imposed a series of conditions on protesters. If, for example, demonstrators stray from the march route, they face arrest. "We have strong reasons to believe that peaceful protest is the last thing on the minds of some of those who will attend," said chief superintendent Elaine Van-Orden. "Criminality at the event has increased year-on-year. Arrests have increased from four in 2012 to 53 in 2016," she added. British media reports say police will ramp up the use of body cameras to monitor violence. What is the focus of this year's rally? More than 1,000 people have expressed interest in attending the London rally on a Facebook page. "We have seen the pushes to make the internet yet another part of the surveillance state, we have seen the government's disregard for migrants, for the poor, the elderly and the disabled," organisers said. "We have seen the capital, profit and greed of the few put before the well-being of the many and we say enough is enough. "The government and the 1 percent have played their hand, now it is time to play ours." The rally is expected to be livestreamed and will be available to watch online .

Michael Fallon unexpectedly resigned late on Wednesday [File: Hannah Mckay/Reuters] Britain's Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has resigned from his post, becoming the first casualty of a series of allegations of sexual misconduct against members of parliament. In a letter sent to Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday, Fallon said his conduct has "fallen below the high standards" required of the country's armed forces. "I have reflected on my position, and I am therefore resigning as defence secretary," Fallon said in the letter. Fallon was accused of repeatedly touching a female journalist's knee during a dinner in 2002. May accepted Fallon's resignation and praised him for his role in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) in Iraq and Syria . The prime minister has called a meeting to discuss the growing controversy over sexual harassment. SOURCE: Al Jazeera News United Kingdom Europe
US President Donald Trump talks to the media before departing on his tour of Asia [Mark Wilson/Getty Images/AFP] From new revelations from the Trump campaign-Russia investigation to a "rewrite" of Civil War history, Al Jazeera examines some of the key developments from the Trump administration last week. 1. The Trump-Russia probe just got real Former Trump aides indicted It was the moment everyone suspected was coming. Some just wondered who and when. On Monday, the first shoe dropped in what will undoubtedly be a series of indictments in the investigation over whether or not the presidential campaign of Donald Trump colluded with Russia. US Special Counsel Robert Mueller announced the indictments of two former campaign staffers on 12 counts, including conspiracy against the United States , money laundering, making false statements and failure to report bank accounts. Paul Manafort chaired the campaign during a critical time in the nomination process, overseeing the convention where Trump became the Republican nominee for president. Manafort's colleague and partner, Rick Gates, was also indicted. According to the court filings, the pair hid " tens of millions of dollars " from their work in Ukraine from 2006 through at least 2016 by laundering "the money through scores of US and foreign corporations, partnerships and bank accounts". Prior to joining the campaign, Manafort often worked for the pro-Russian government of Victor Yanukovych. {articleGUID} Manafort's lawyer reiterated on Monday that his client never colluded with Russia and his, "was seeking to further democracy and to help the Ukrainians come closer to the United States". The White House asserts the two men's activities occurred outside their duties with the campaign. There was no mention of the Trump campaign in the indictment. Who is George Papadopoulos? There were plenty of mentions of the Trump campaign in the third indictment of a relatively unknown Trump adviser. George Papadopoulos, third left, is seen in a photograph released on Donald Trump's Instagram account on April 1, 2016, with a headline saying it was taken during a campaign national security meeting in Washington, DC, March 31, 2016 [Instagram/@realDonaldTrump/AFP] The curious case of George Papadopoulos has raised concerns that he has valuable information the special counsel is now using to get to others from the Trump campaign. On October 5, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to making false statements to investigators. That information was sealed until Monday. Papadopoulos was a foreign policy adviser who joined the Trump campaign in March 2016. Trump himself praised him as "an excellent guy". {articleGUID} Papadopoulos once appeared on Trump's website at a national security roundtable meeting with the candidate. According to Mueller, Papadopoulos presented himself to the Trump campaign as someone who had contacts in the Kremlin and reportedly said the Russians had "dirt" on Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton . He offered to act as a go-between with Moscow. At least one senior campaign staffer, according to the court documents, encouraged Papadopoulos to go to Russia to meet officials, "if it is feasible". Trump dismissed Papadopoulos as "a liar" on Twitter and the White House has painted him as a volunteer who attended one meeting with Trump and was quickly brushed aside. Unbeknownst to the White House before Monday, however, is that Papadopoulos has been working with investigators and is described by Mueller as a "proactive cooperator". Stay tuned. Sam Clovis becomes a casualty of the investigation He was a fixture on the Trump campaign early on and an important strategist for a man seeking wins in key states. But Sam Clovis, a top Trump adviser, also became a victim of the Mueller indictments this week. On Thursday, he officially withdrew his nomination as chief scientist for the US Department of Agriculture after his lawyer confirmed he was the "campaign supervisor" named in the Papadopoulos case. {articleGUID} According to the documents, the supervisor was in touch with Papadopoulos after his meetings with Russians and told him he had done "great work". The nomination of Clovis was also under heavy scrutiny because he lacked any real qualifications, listing his level of experience in natural sciences as "none". His controversial views on climate change , racism and the public education system also raised concerns among Democratic congressmen who had already slowed his nomination. 2. Democrats 'rigged' the system in favour of Hillary In a scathing hit piece in the publication, Politico, the former Democratic National Committee (DNC) interim chair confirmed what many people suspected: the Democratic nomination for president was rigged in Hillary Clinton's favour. Donna Brazile took over the chair in July 2016 and found a party deeply in debt but more importantly, completely rigged to ensure Clinton would get the nomination no matter what. According to Brazile, under a legal agreement signed a year earlier, the party was required to divert money to the Clinton campaign and away from other candidates, including her biggest opponent, Bernie Sanders . {articleGUID} "This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the party's integrity," she wrote. Brazile also wrote that she had to mentally prepare for a phone call to deliver the news to Sanders who contested Clinton all the way to the convention in July 2016. The Brazile revelations have only emboldened Trump's attacks on Clinton, whom he once promised to throw in jail. "At some point, the justice department, and the FBI," he Tweeted Friday, "must do what is right and proper." 3. Trump's double standards on attacks Within two hours of Tuesday's horrific truck attack in New York City, Donald Trump took to Twitter to condemn it as a "terrorist" incident. Police said Saipov Sayfullo, an Uzbek national, carried out the attack in " the name of ISIS ", referring to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ). {articleGUID} Saipov, 29, came to the US legally in 2010. That was all the ammunition Trump needed to launch a 24-hour political offensive on immigrants and foreigners including a promise to shut down the Diversity Visa Lottery Program, signed into law by former Republican President George HW Bush. He also said he would consider sending Saipov to US-run detention prison at Guantanamo Bay . Many people pointed out the stark contrast to his reaction to other attacks by white assailants in which the president's reactions were muted and or cautious, even less political. Following a shooting in Las Vegas by a white man just a few weeks earlier, in which 59 people were killed, and 500 others injured, Trump repeatedly cautioned anyone calling for gun control regulation. "That's for - at a later time," he said three days after the shooting. {articleGUID} Others also pointed to his response to the killing of a woman at a counterdemonstration during a white supremacist rally in August. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed after a man with ties to a white supremacist group allegedly rammed his car into a group of anti-racist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia. Trump blamed "both sides" for the violence. Even when he denounced the attack, he said "there were very fine" people among the white supremacists and counterprotesters. 4. Trump's Chief of Staff John Kelly 'rewrites' Civil War history The US Civil War from 1860-1865 has always hung over American racial politics. But following a march in August by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia - sparked by the decision to tear down Civil War monuments - the conflict has fuelled a number of back-and-forth debates over its legacy by the Trump administration and the media. {articleGUID} On Monday, Trump's chief of staff, General John Kelly, ignited that debate again. In an interview with Fox News, Kelly said the Civil War - in which the southern Confederate Army took up arms to preserve the institution of slavery - was the result of a "lack of compromise". Critics blasted Kelly for wondering aloud if he was suggesting the US should have compromised on the issue of slavery. Many accused the chief of staff of "rewriting" history. Kelly also referred to Confederate Army General Robert E Lee as "an honourable man". The White House did not back down after Kelly's remarks "I am not going to get up here and relitigate the Civil War," White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Tuesday. "If some individuals engaged had been willing to come to some compromises on different things, then it may not have occurred." 5. Trump heads to Asia It will be Trump's longest foreign trip so far - a 12-day excursion to Japan, South Korea, China , Vietnam and the Philippines. {articleGUID} On Friday morning, the US president took off for a region that has been a major focus of his ire. In August, Trump set off alarm bells throughout Asia when he told reporters that any attempts by North Korea to develop a nuclear warhead would be met "with fire, fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before". Officials say Trump will reiterate his tough talk in Seoul next week while visiting a memorial to Americans who died on the peninsula in the Korean conflict of the 1950s. Trump will also raise the issue of perceived unfair trade practices by China while in Beijing. But all eyes will be on him when he meets Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in Manila for the first time. Duterte rejected an invitation from Trump to visit the White House and criticised US congressmen for condemning his reported human rights abuses. "I've seen America and it's lousy," Duterte said in July. SOURCE: Al Jazeera News ABOUT THE AUTHOR Chris Sheridan @ ChrisSheridan34 Donald Trump United States US & Canada Politics
Protester wears a Trump mask under the banner 'Protect the climate - stop coal' in Bonn, Germany [Wolfgang Rattay/Reuters] Bonn, Germany - It is that time of year when the annual climate wagon rolls into town, replete with delegates, politicians, scientists and lobbyists. COP23, the UN Climate Change Conference, begins on Monday in the German city of Bonn. In theory, the 2017 version should be a wholly uninteresting fortnight of impenetrable text revisions and, to the outsider, unintelligible policy engineering. But then factor in the US president. In June this year, Donald Trump told the world the US would not be staying in the Paris Agreement , an accord forged in 2015 by all nations bar Nicaragua and Syria . It pledged to hold global warming "well below 2C" and aim for a 1.5C limit. {articleGUID} Since then Nicaragua has signed up, so the US is now in company only with Syria in its climate vision - a dysfunctional nation ripped apart by war . There have been concerns as to whether the impending US withdrawal will derail the whole agreement. It certainly has changed the dynamic but perhaps, in a surprising way, it appears to have galvanised the effort to tackle climate change. Even within the US , cities and states have taken it upon themselves to fight back against the federal scepticism which is reversing President Obama 's environmental policies and trying to re-energise coal in the name of jobs. Take California's governor Jerry Brown, who runs a state which continues to lead in reducing emissions regardless of federal policy. He minimises the negative effects of Trump and is helping fund a US pavilion in Bonn, which will extol the virtues of climate change policy. On the other hand, it is reported the Trump administration will be promoting coal, natural gas and nuclear energy as an answer to climate change at an event at Bonn. They will argue that no credible projection shows fossil fuels meeting less than 40 percent of global energy demand by 2050. This is likely to be a hugely popular event by virtue of the sheer unpopularity of the concept. Despite Trump, 'we're still doing this' Meanwhile, NGOs will be pacing the floors of the conference halls to try and keep up momentum. The WWF's climate adviser, Dr Stephen Cornelius, says global unity can be maintained without the White House. "Clearly, America is an important country," said Dr Cornelius. "But you saw when President Trump made his announcement in June, you had a lot of countries standing up saying 'we're still doing this'. "So even without the federal government stepping up to the plate, you have national actors prepared to do so." Clearly, America is an important country. But you saw when President Trump made his announcement in June, you had a lot of countries standing up saying 'we're still doing this'. Dr Stephen Cornelius, WWF climate adviser However you feel about climate change, this has been an extraordinary year of weather . Warming oceans have fuelled the fury of unprecedented hurricanes and cyclones across the world. There have been raging wildfires, floods and heatwaves. The science of attribution is still being developed but a trend appears to be emerging of bigger, more destructive events. 'Still emitting far too much' And that is of particular to concern to low-lying Fiji , which holds this year's presidency of the climate conference. As sea levels rise, Fiji officials will be pressing for the big emitters to step forward and quite simply offer more in the global effort to tackle climate change. Ultimately, this conference will try to formulate a rulebook on how to proceed and actually implement the Paris Agreement in the year 2020. Time is of the essence, say the experts. Trump may not be listening but let us leave the last word to Erik Solheim, head of the United Nations Environment Programme, who puts it simply. "The numbers don't lie. We are still emitting far too much and this needs to be reversed." SOURCE: Al Jazeera News ABOUT THE AUTHOR Nick Clark Environment Europe US & Canada United States Donald Trump
The Ku Klux Klan rallied in Charlottesville, Virginia, in July [Steve Helber/AP Photo] Over the past 16 years, the number of far-right attacks in the United States has grown to an average of 300 per year, according to a study by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. Since the election of right-wing US President Donald Trump in November, researchers and activists say far-right groups have been emboldened to carry out more hate crimes. The Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), an organisation that monitors hate groups, recorded an average of 87 hate incidents a day during the ten-day period after Trump’s elections. This is five times the daily average of hate crimes recorded by the FBI in 2015. Many of those hate incidents targeted people of colour, Muslims, Jews, members of the LGBTQ community and others. The upsurge in racist violence has been punctuated by a handful of deadly attacks. Al Jazeera has broken down some of the most high-profile killings attributed to far-right violence in 2017. Charlottesville’s 'Unite the Right' rally, August 2017 On August 12, 2017, hundreds of white supremacists and neo-Nazis converged on Charlottesville, Virginia, for “Unite the Right”, the largest far-right rally to be held in the US in recent decades. {articleGUID} That rally was called by Jason Kessler, a former journalist and white supremacist activist, and was attended by several groups affiliated with the alt-right, a loosely knit coalition of white supremacists, white nationalists and neo-Nazis. Unite the Right participants clashed with community members, anti-racists and anti-fascist activists throughout the city. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed on August 12, 2017 [Michael Dwyer/AP Photo] By the end of the day, 20-year-old James Alex Fields allegedly ploughed his car into an anti-racist march and killed 32-year-old Heather Heyer, a social worker and activist. At least 19 others were injured in the incident. Earlier in the day, Fields was photographed marching with Vanguard America, a neo-Nazi group. He was subsequently charged with second-degree murder and a slew of felonies. Islamophobic tirade ends with deadly stabbings, May 2017 Jeremy Christian, 35, stabbed three men for attempting to intervene when he hurled anti-Muslim insults at two teenage girls on a light rail train in Portland, Oregon. Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche, 23, and Ricky John Best, 53, were stabbed to death on May 26, 2017 [Facebook] Christian had been photographed a week earlier performing Nazi salutes at a far-right rally a week before the attack. Two of the victims, 53-year-old Ricky John Best and 23-year-old Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, died. Micah Fletcher, who is now 21, survived the attack. {articleGUID} Upon entering the court room for a hearing following the killings, Christian bellowed: "You call it terrorism; I call it patriotism. You hear me? Die. Death to the enemies of America. Leave this country if you hate our freedom.” Fletcher later spoke to local media about the attack. "The Muslim community, especially in Portland, needs to understand that there are a lot of us that are not going to stand by and let anybody - whether they are from here or not - scare you into thinking you can't be a part of this town, this city, this community or this country," he said. Stabbed to death while waiting for Uber, May 2017 Sean Christopher Urbanski, 22, was charged with first- and second-degree murder after allegedly stabbing to death 23-year-old Richard Collins III, an African American university student and lieutenant in the US army, as the victim and his friends waited for an Uber on the University of Maryland’s campus. Richard Collins III, 22, was killed on May 20, 2017 [Bowie State University/Handout/Reuters] Police did not charge Urbanski with a hate crime, but critics denounced the decision and pointed to his membership in a Facebook group called “Alt-Reich: Nation”. {articleGUID} “Reich” was ostensibly a reference to the German Nazi regime known as the Third Reich, and the group was full of anti-Semitic and racist content. Collins was only three days away from graduating from nearby Bowie State University at the time of his killing. At the time, Prince George County’s State Attorney Angela D Alsobrooks said prosecutors would “need something probably more than just a Facebook posting” to charge the assailant with a hate crime. Black man fatally stabbed with a sword, March 2017 James Harris Jackson, a 28-year-old white man from Baltimore, travelled to New York City in the hope of killing black people, according to investigators. Upon arriving in the city, Jackson used a sword to fatally stab 66-year-old Timothy Caughman, an African American. Timothy Caughman, 66, was stabbed to death on March 20, 2017 [Timothy Caughman/Twitter] Investigators later stated that Jackson admitted that he went to New York City to kill African Americans because he believed it would get more media attention. Subsequent media profiles painted Jackson, an army veteran, as a man who harboured intense anti-black racism for most of his life. Indian immigrant shot dead, February 2017 Adam W Purinton, a 51-year-old white man, was kicked out of a bar in Kansas City after hurling racist slurs at Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, two immigrants from India. Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, was killed on February 22, 2017 [David Ryder/Reuters] Witnesses said Purinton later shouted “get out of my country” as he shot the two men, killing Kuchibhotla and injuring Madasani, both 32 years old. {articleGUID} The assailant was later charged with a hate crime, murder, attempted murder and weapons charges. Sunaina Dumala, Kuchibhotla’s widow, told media outlets she was already concerned about anti-immigrant violence before the attack that left her husband dead. "He did not deserve a death like this," Dumala, who was planning her first child with her husband, said at the time.

Amanda's addiction started with prescription painkillers [Josh Rushing/Al Jazeera] The US drug epidemic - which now claims more lives than gun deaths - shows no sign of abating. One region that has been hit hard is central and southern Ohio, the towns and cities along Route 23, a highway that has become known for heroin trafficking. Amanda is a recovering addict from Chillicothe, Ohio. Her addiction started with a Percocet prescription for back pain. She later switched to heroin because it was cheaper and easier to get hold of. After almost dying from an overdose in front of her young son, she stopped using heroin, but she is still battling addiction. This is her story in her own words. I grew up in Latham, Ohio, a small town probably 10 to 15 minutes from Chillicothe. Latham was just kind of boring. There's not really much to do. There's no movie theatres, nothing. {articleGUID} I think that's one of the bigger issues for a lot of kids around here; a lot of the drug problem is because people are bored. My husband, Justin, and I later moved to Fort Campbell, an army base in Kentucky. And that actually is where my addiction kind of began. It began when I got a prescription for some pain pills and then my husband was on pain pills, Percocet, and I just kept taking them. I liked them. I was having some back pain, went to the doctor and they're very bad about over-prescribing pretty much for anything. Or they used to be. "You got back pain? Here's some Percocet." I liked them and kept taking them. It made you feel numb, happy and warm inside. After I fell pregnant, I quit taking them. When we moved back here to Ohio, I got a hold of pain pills off the street. I was homesick. I got in with some of the wrong people and started taking Percocet, but this time, I started taking higher doses. It got to where I liked it so much it became an everyday thing. The price of them was like $40 a pill, so think about it, when you're taking at least two to three a day, that's an expensive habit. Then, someone I knew introduced me to heroin. I was uneducated about it. I began using. Started off snorting it, and then it progressed deeper, and before I knew it, it got to the point where if I didn't have it I felt like I was going to die. In the beginning, my husband didn't know. I hid it pretty good. I think he knew that I was using something, but I don't think he realised the extent. The wake-up call Once, I had used, and we went a couple minutes down the road to a gas station. He comes out of the store, and I am completely collapsed over. He thinks I'm joking. He's like, "quit messing, what's wrong with you?" He goes to pull me out of the car, and I'm purple and blue, like I had OD'd. He had to do CPR. My son was in the backseat. I was so lost in that addiction, I never knew how bad it was, and I didn't even think you could die. That was, of course, when heroin first started going round. Now it's like people are dying left and right. I got so thin because I was so strung out, and when I was like that, I just wouldn't eat. I went down to 100 pounds, and I'm 5'11". I was so thin. I'll struggle with addiction for the rest of my life. I do believe once you're an addict you're always an addict… it'll always be a battle for me. Amanda, recovering drug addict I'm lucky I never ended up with Hepatitis like a lot of people. I was clean about it, but how clean can you be, you know? You're injecting something that could kill you. When you're using that every day it's like your brain has completely changed. Like, you are not the same person you were before. It controls your mind, your way of thinking, everything. 'It hurt seeing them go through withdrawal' I never used heroin again after that. But I had two pregnancies on the Subutex [the brand name for the opioid buprenorphine]. When I gave birth, they sent their cords off and tested them, and nothing came back but the buprenorphine. But my babies both withdrew off of it. {articleGUID} It was out of my control. I wanted off that medicine but my doctor told me if I quit taking it, I wouldn't carry the baby at all - that my body would most likely miscarry. That's the problem, though; people pay $200 to $300 to see their doctor. They don't cut their dose. You have to basically tell the doctor, "Ok, I'm ready for you to lower my dose now". It's kind of like they're pill mills, in a sense. So your baby is withdrawing from this medicine that you have to take and you didn't have no choice in the matter, because if you wanted them to live, you had to take it. But it hurt seeing them withdraw like that. It's all from my addiction. I put my babies through that. You have a lot of guilt and shame because it's sad to see a baby have to go through that. I stayed at the hospital with them both the whole time and did everything I could to comfort them. They were the saddest days in my life because I just felt so bad. Recovering addict Amanda with her youngest child in the backyard of her Ohio home. [Josh Rushing/Al Jazeera] 'I just lost it' I was such a good girl: went to school, started college. I was a perfect kid, and it was like, I just lost it. I liked the good, happy feeling when I got my fix. It's like a big blanket just goes over you. Everything just feels perfect, you just feel like a new person. You don't think about the negative. You don't think about anything. It's just like nothing matters. I went to my in-laws for [my son] Brody's birthday party once, and I was sick, had to have my fix for the day. I left his party to go get my fix. Looking back, I feel horrible for it, but then I wasn't the same person. Amanda was gone. I wasn't Amanda anymore. I was someone else. It was like I was possessed. I can never imagine leaving one of my children's birthday parties now. {articleGUID} I would meet my dealer at his hotel, and I always had this guilt about my son in the back of my mind. But I just needed to feel better so I could take care of him. I needed to feel better so I could be a mum. I almost felt like I couldn't take care of him without that. I'm down to a quarter of Suboxone [a prescription medicine that contains buprenorphine and naloxone] a day, and I'm planning to come off that and go on the Vivitrol shot [an injectable medicine used to prevent relapse to opioid dependence] because I don't have cravings. Going off Suboxone is worse than coming off heroin; you feel sicker than with heroin. The doctors do not tell you that when they start you on it. 'It's like you're possessed' People are so discriminating when it comes to addicts. I am a good mum. Some of the people that I have seen use are people you would never think use. It's not like every drug addict is a junkie. They're people, and they're just wound up in this battle in their brain. It's like you're possessed. It's almost like the heroin is like a devil and it has taken you completely over. Addiction is just such a deep emotion. I never, in my life, felt as lost. I had great hopes, dreams, and it just took it all, and I am only now to where I'm starting to get my life back. It's so bad when you see people struggling with addiction… you just want to grab them and shake them and be like, "you're going to die". Amanda, recovering drug addict It has really affected me and my sister's relationship. She's just now gotten to the point where she trusts me again and lets me watch my niece. I was a liar and a con artist. I was so manipulative and would lie about ways to get money. If someone is on drugs, they're a liar. They're going to tell you that the sky is purple if they can get $20 out of it. It's so bad when you see people struggling with addiction… you just want to grab them and shake them and be like, "you're going to die". Now that I've dealt with addiction issues, I'm of course worried about the cycle. I hope and pray every day that my children never go through this, and if they do, I'm going to tell them my story. I'll struggle with addiction for the rest of my life. I do believe once you're an addict you're always an addict… it'll always be a battle for me. Now it's the Suboxone, you know. That's a battle to get off that last small dose.

Native Americans were made US citizens in 1924 [AP] Happy Native American Heritage Month! In this "Make America Great Again" era, where white nationalists (and your nextdoor neighbours who claim not to be white nationalists) rail against undocumented immigration and yearn for the indeterminate days of yore, it's easy to forget that the United States did not spring up, fully-formed, as a nation of "native" whites. No, the America of today emerged from lands populated by millions of indigenous peoples - the "first Americans". Yet, over time, white people in the United States reshaped the definition of "American" and its counterpart, the "foreigner", to erase indigenous peoples' primacy and modern-day existence. The indigenous peoples of North America created bustling cities and impressive empires (13th-century Cahokia, overlooking modern-day St Louis, and the 18th-century Comanche Empire being two examples) before and after they encountered white and black newcomers. These foreigners carried no immigration papers (unless a papal bull or a magisterial decree count as such) and they kept coming, bearing disease, advanced weaponry, and new systems of labour and gender hierarchy. Soon after their arrival, Europeans began to differentiate themselves from Native Americans. They labelled Native Americans savages for many reasons: they bathed too often, owned land in common rather than individually, allowed women the freedom to divorce and have multiple sexual partners, traced ancestry through the female line, and on and on. Most importantly, Native Americans largely did not participate in a capitalist world view. While chiefs and prominent tribespeople often possessed fancier jewellery or clothing than other tribespeople, for the most part, societal economic equality ruled. For these reasons, Europeans speculated, Native Americans did not deserve the lands they presided over. The English, especially, who hailed from a crowded island nation, sought to settle and repurpose indigenous lands for themselves. {articleGUID} Already in the 16th century, the English portrayed themselves as deserving inhabitants versus native peoples' wasteful unsuitability. In keeping with the English-Christian world view of the time that the land, animals, and environment were meant for human benefit, the English slowly wrested land, resources, and power from Native Americans through war, theft, and inadequate payment. After years of discord between the English colonies, on the precipice of the American Revolution, an unsettled and much-contested identity as "American" - in opposition to British - was born. Native Americans were left out of the peace talks that followed the revolution, in which European powers divvied up the land on which native peoples still lived. As the newly birthed United States moved into the 19th century, "Manifest Destiny" reigned, and white Americans claimed indigenous land as their own on their westward trek. Indigenous peoples, still not American citizens at that point, became inconvenient occupants within their own homelands. The mid-to-late 1800s brought increasing immigration from Ireland , Scotland, Germany, and Italy , and as these ethnic groups, originally targeted as "foreigners" negotiated their assimilation into "whiteness," scholars and local historians wrote Native Americans into obscurity, claiming they had died out and thus refuting indigenous claims to land and sovereignty. While the 1924 Native American Citizenship Act granted all Native Americans born in the United States citizenship, indigenous peoples had largely disappeared from modern popular culture, surviving principally in retreads of old battles as portrayed in Westerns. {articleGUID} Even today, while the fervour over the indigenous protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline grabbed headlines and attention due to celebrity participation, the media soon forgot the Sioux peoples whose livelihoods have suffered due to the billion-dollar project. The latinos/as who have become the face of the undocumented citizenship conversation and the targets of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement are the descendants of indigenous and mixed-race people who once roamed the modern-day southwestern United States - after all, the Mexican American War was only 169 years ago - not long ago in the scheme of nation-building. Why is it then, that this discussion around immigration and the call to "Make America Great Again" obscures the undocumented white immigration that created the United States and the former porousness of the arbitrary border that now separates Mexico and the United States? The "America" of old was one in which the mores of immigration constantly shifted and citizenship was not necessarily racialised. But I don't think that's the American greatness white nationalists are referencing.

The New York City Police Department has a long-standing tradition of violence - particularly against marginalised populations, writes Kelly [Reuters] On Monday, New York police officers Eddie Martins and Richard Hall pleaded not guilty to charges of sexually assaulting an 18-year-old woman in September. The victim, Anna Chambers, accused the two plain-clothes NYPD narcotic detectives of kidnapping, sexual assault, and rape. She says that on September 15, after she was arrested for possession of cannabis and an anti-anxiety drug, the officers took her alone to a nearby car park. There, she alleges that she was violently raped by Martins and sexually assaulted by both officers. DNA from the officers was found after Chambers went to a hospital and had a rape kit done. Hall and Martins both admitted having sexual contact with Chambers but publicly insisted that the sex was "consensual", which is an impossible statement given the power dynamic at play. Simply put, there's no such thing as consent when a police officer has a person in handcuffs, as journalist Natasha Lennard explained in a recent piece for The Intercept . As public attention is focused on the multiplying accusations of sexual assault against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, Chambers' case shines a light on yet another public sphere in which men pervasively abuse power and authority to commit sex-related crimes: law enforcement. The rates of police officers committing a sex-related crime are "significantly higher" than the general population. The true scope of the problem remains unknown. Many victims would not come forward because they have to report the abuse to another police officer; thus, such violent incidents are often called "hidden crimes". And, as Chambers' case illustrates, sex-related police crimes are often committed against younger or even underage individuals, who are more vulnerable and less likely to speak out. Among many risks that victims face, apart from violent reprisals, are public smear campaigns as happened with Chambers. Prior to the indictment, the NYPD took an actively antagonistic tone towards her, seeking to discredit the young woman's testimony and smear her character. The internal culture of the NYPD is clearly toxic, and has proven time and time again to be a safe harbour for those who'd rather abuse the people they're supposed to 'protect'. In a letter to the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office obtained by the New York Post, the police officers' lawyers pointed to Chambers' rambunctious social media presence and "provocative" selfies as evidence that she was lying about the rape. "This behavior is unprecedented for a depressed victim of a vicious rape," the letter reads, as if written by someone who has never interacted with a teenager before, let alone one processing brutal trauma under public scrutiny. The insinuation that there is only one appropriate reaction to this kind of violence is a slap in the face to all sexual assault survivors and highlights the cruelty and ambivalence with which the NYPD tends to treat its own sexual assault cases. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) has a long-standing tradition of violence, particularly against marginalised populations. A quick Google search of "NYPD sexual assault" dredges up case after case - even against their own, as in the case of Deputy Inspector Keith Walton, who in 2016 was charged with felony sexual abuse after allegedly assaulting a female police officer, or in at least three lawsuits last year that involved sexual harassment of female NYPD officers by male co-workers. {articleGUID} Outside the office, things only get worse. In 2011, Officer Harold Avalos responded to a woman on a domestic abuse call, contacted her at a later date, formed a relationship, and allegedly raped her in a motel . In 2012, Officer Arthur Roldan was charged with raping his former girlfriend at gunpoint in a car park; that same year, independently of Roldan's case, Officer Michael Pena was convicted of the very same crime. In 2013, NYPD highway officer Carlos Becker filmed a Bronx woman while she was in custody, then sent her flirtatious texts. It is alleged that he eventually drugged her at a bar and raped her. Becker was indicted for filming the woman, but the NYPD declined to pursue rape charges. In April 2015, NYPD officer Delfin Lantigua pleaded guilty to soliciting sex and cash from a woman who sought a job in his department. In May this year, three NYPD officers at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn were arrested on charges of sexually abusing at least half a dozen female inmates. The list goes on, and on, and on, and never gets any less horrifying. Unless they are actually indicted, in the eyes of the NYPD, these men technically have not done anything wrong. True, it is against NYPD policy for officers to have sex on duty; those who do so can be charged with the broad offence of official misconduct, which bars the misuse of official authority for personal benefit. However, nothing in city law makes the behaviour explicitly illegal. This leaves a loophole for predator police officers to exploit, and the reasoning behind this is unclear. Last week, following the news of Martins and Hall's indictment, New York City Councilman Mark Treyger announced t hat he would draft legislation that would make it illegal for a police officer to engage in sexual activity with someone in police custody, whether in a police car or in the course of an arrest or law enforcement action. As its own history makes clear, the NYPD has not been trying all that hard to foster friendly relationships with New Yorkers who do not happen to be white and male. Whether Martins and Halls end up behind bars or not, they have joined a long line of others who have been caught committing shameful, depraved sexual abuse against the people of New York City - and the people owe it to themselves to speak out against these crimes and the broken policing system that shields those who commit them. We need to serve and protect our own by strengthening community support networks and pushing back against police violence with every ounce of strength we have. The internal culture of the NYPD is clearly toxic, and has proven time and time again to be a safe harbour for those who would rather abuse the people they are supposed to " protect ". Demanding justice for Anna Chambers is only the beginning. The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial policy.

In total, more than 100,000 visas were revoked with the stroke of Trump's pen and with it hundreds and thousands of lives were disrupted, writes Elamin [Reuters] Earlier this year, the then White House Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, argued that the 109 airport detentions authorised under the first Muslim ban were a "minor inconvenience" to keep America safe. I was among those 109 people who were detained, questioned, handcuffed and body searched under the ban, and nothing about our experiences could be characterised as minor or inconvenient. An Iraqi man who was detained with me at John F Kennedy airport in New York on the evening of January 27 had waited for two years to receive a visa that would reunite him with his wife and child. As his family waited on the other side of the airport border, I watched him grow increasingly anxious and distraught as he was denied a translator and told that he could be deported back to Iraq . A few hours later, a 76-year-old Sudanese man with health issues was detained in the same terminal and held for 30 hours without medical attention. At Dulles Airport, some 400km away, a five-year-old boy with a US passport was detained and separated from his Iranian mother for several hours. For every one of us who was detained at a US airport, many more were prevented from boarding their planes at terminals around the world. In total, more than 100,000 visas were revoked with the stroke of US President Donald Trump's pen, and with it, hundreds and thousands of lives were altered and disrupted . In many ways, the mainstream media's somewhat myopic focus on our detentions, particularly on the detentions of doctors and researchers like myself, masked this reality. Thousands were separated from their family members, were forced to postpone weddings and important medical procedures, interrupted their studies and lost employment and life savings as a result of the first ban. Because the Muslim ban is also a refugee ban , thousands of refugees, who risked their lives to flee wars and political persecution, were denied safety and refuge after years of navigating a scrupulous, bureaucratic US visa process. The irony, of course, is that the Trump administration intended to ban citizens of seven countries where US military interventions and policies have created some of the conditions that are forcing people to become refugees. The curious case of Sudan and Chad As the Trump administration attempted to implement the third version of the "Muslim ban" in mid-October, it intended to continue disrupting the lives of thousands with no regard for their safety, dignity or well-being. {articleGUID} But this latest iteration of the ban brings something else into focus as well, namely that this administration and its corporate partners intend to use citizens of the eight banned countries as bargaining chips to punish or blackmail their governments into playing by their rules. The curious addition of Chad to the list of banned countries and Sudan's removal from it highlights this point quite clearly. On September 24, the Trump administration announced it would be suspending all non-immigrant and immigrant visas for citizens of Chad, which took Chadian officials and analysts by surprise. In a statement, the White House claimed that Chad "does not adequately share public safety and terrorism related information" and that " several terrorist groups are active within Chad or in the surrounding region, including elements of Boko Haram…" This past March, Chad hosted the annual US-led Flintlock military exercise in West Africa, aimed at expanding the US' military presence in Africa and at strengthening "joint counter-terrorism efforts against groups like Boko Haram". Given Chad's active role in leading counterterrorism efforts in partnership with the US and in facilitating the expansion of the US military in central Africa, one might ask, why was it added to the list of banned countries? Regional experts have speculated that Chad fell into the bad graces of the US, and its Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in particular, after it attempted to demand a $74bn fine from the US oil company Exxon Mobil, for not meeting its tax obligations. Tillerson left his post as CEO of Exxon to join the Trump administration while the company was still embroiled in a prolonged dispute with Chad over a court ruling regarding its tax payments. While Exxon later reached a settlement with Chadian officials to avoid paying the hefty tax fine, Tillerson's role in crafting the newest iteration of the ban was likely shaped by the three-year dispute over it. If anything, the dispute called Chad's loyalty as a US ally into question and paved the way for the US government and its corporate partners to begin looking elsewhere in the region for business partnerships around mineral and oil exploration and allies in its "war on terror", which brings us to Sudan . It is deeply concerning to me that a policy as inhumane and unjust as the Muslim ban is being used by the Trump administration as a bargaining chip to punish, shift alliances and extract favours from foreign governments. While the Sudanese regime has very little lobbying power in Washington, it has diligently cultivated its relationship with US allies in the Middle East in order to attract foreign investment in its agriculture, mining and petroleum sectors, after the oil-rich South seceded. Since 2015, the Sudanese regime has sent thousands of combat soldiers to Yemen , where the US government is supporting UAE and Saudi-led efforts against the Iranian-backed Houthis . In return for providing the kind of "boots on the ground engagement" that the Saudis and Emiratis are unwilling to risk themselves, the UAE's ambassador to the US, Yousef Al Otaiba has been "putting his substantial diplomatic weight behind the Sudanese government". {articleGUID} This past June, as the Trump administration was scheduled to make a decision about whether or not to lift its sanctions against Sudan, President Omar al-Bashir's regime increased the number of Sudanese combat soldiers in Yemen to 8000. This move gave the UAE the push it needed to step up its lobbying efforts in Washington, which in turn led the Trump administration to postpone its decision on whether or not to extend sanctions against Sudan. In August, the Deputy Commander of the US Africa Command, General Alexander Laskaris, visited Khartoum as both countries worked on resuming military cooperation after Sudan severed its ties with North Korea. In September, Sudan was quietly removed from the Muslim ban list, and on October 6, after 20 years of imposing sanctions on Sudan, the Trump administration lifted them. To be clear, the lifting of US sanctions comes as a relief to most Sudanese who have borne the brunt of its effects. What I aim to draw attention to here, is the heavy price being paid for this shift in US policy towards Sudan. Sudanese soldiers are dying in an unjust war that has killed over 10,000 Yemeni civilians. The gradual thawing of the relationship between Sudan and the US is also lending legitimacy to the Bashir regime, which continues its genocidal assault on communities in Darfur and the Nuba Mountains. This is to say nothing of the impact US corporate and military expansion is having on communities across the region. Chad's addition to the list of banned countries, for instance, highlights the way US corporate partnerships with foreign governments are shaping and driving US policies in troubling ways. It is deeply concerning to me that a policy as inhumane and unjust as the "Muslim ban" is being used by the Trump administration as a bargaining chip to punish, shift alliances and extract favours from foreign governments. There is simply put, nothing minor or justifiable about playing with people's lives in such a cruel manner.

New York City, New York - Claims that left-wing activists and anti-fascists (also known as "Antifa") planned to "behead white parents" and deploy "super soldiers" as part of a bid to launch a civil war turned out to be a series of modest anti-Trump marches in cities across the country. Saturday's demonstrations and marches, which took place in several US cities and largely passed without incident, had been billed by far-right websites as plans to carry out mass bloodshed and execute a coup against right-wing President Donald Trump . RefuseFascism.Org, a left-wing protest group, called for the rallies to "drive out" the Trump administration, sparking a storm of far-right conspiracy theories about anti-fascists' alleged plans to start a civil war in the country. A day before the rallies, Fox News dubbed the events the "Antifa apocalypse", while far-right forums claimed that leftists planned to indiscriminately murder white people on Saturday. But the rallies were a far cry from the conspiracy theories that had gone viral on far-right websites, with some 300 people assembling in New York City and dozens rallying in places like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and Portland, among others. Speaking to Al Jazeera at the rally, RefuseFascism.Org organiser Carl Dix said far-right websites and social media users spread rumours online because "they wanted to demonise what we're doing". {articleGUID} "They cooked up a conscious lie talking about violence," he said. "We said from the beginning this was going to be a non-violent protest." Rally participants held signs and banners, reading "the Trump-Pence regime must go!" "I am sexually attracted to indictments," another sign said. A handful of pro-Trump hecklers milled around the march, chanting back occasionally, and a brief altercation between a left-wing march participant and a counterdemonstrator was broken up by police. 'Behead all white parents' Although RefuseFascism.Org considers itself an anti-fascist group, the organisation is linked to the relatively small Revolutionary Communist Party and is not tied to Antifa chapters and groups that have been clashing with far-right protesters. The rumours surrounding the rallies first went viral after InfoWars, a conspiracy theory website headed by Alex Jones, published a story under the title: "Antifa plan civil war to overthrow Trump on November 4". After InfoWars ran that story, far-right websites claimed that Antifa "super soldiers" planned to take to the streets and wage chaos and bloodshed. Gateway Pundit, a far-right website that supports Trump, published an article purporting that Antifa planned to "behead all white parents", citing a satirical post by comedic Twitter account @KrangTNelson. RefuseFascism.Org protest organisers told Al Jazeera they subsequently received a torrent of hateful messages, including death threats. {articleGUID} Daryl Lamont Jenkins, an anti-fascist researcher and founder of the One People's Project, said that the far right has a long history of spreading misinformation about left-wing protests. In June, far-right demonstrators gathered in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, after online conspiracy theories claimed that anti-fascists and leftists planned to deface Confederate gravestones at a Civil War cemetery. Just weeks before that, armed militia members and other far-rightists showed up for a counterprotest in Houston, Texas, after a hoax Facebook page announced that left-wing activists intended to tear down a statue of Sam Houston, a political leader and military figure who fought for the independence of Texas and later advocated the territory becoming a US state. "This is what defines the far right," Jenkins told Al Jazeera, describing the conspiracy theories about a civil war on Saturday as "a sign of desperation". He said: "They've decided to create their own world, and we're just living in it for some reason. It's downright pathetic."

Trump arrives for a 12-day trip to the Asia-Pacific region on Sunday [Kevin Lamarque/Reuters] New York City - Donald Trump 's upcoming tour of Asia offers plenty to keep the US president cheerful, from lavish state banquets to honour-guard pomp and even a chummy round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe . That's where the fun stops. It also represents a gruelling 12-day slog of speech-making, summits, and tricky sit-downs on a range of trade disputes - and the intractable policy headache of North Korea's nuclear arms programme . These are big tests for a commander-in-chief who does, on occasion, follow the teleprompter and stay "on message", but at other times becomes frustrated and fires off salvos of brusque, early morning Twitter missives. Before Air Force One takes off for a Hawaii visit on Friday, Al Jazeera picked out the key challenges facing Trump on an odyssey that starts in Japan on Sunday before stops in South Korea , China, Vietnam and the Philippines . North Korea The way the Trump administration tells it, the totalitarian regime in Pyongyang is rapidly developing nuclear warheads and the intercontinental ballistic missiles to carry them to a US West Coast city such as Seattle or Los Angeles. {articleGUID} The White House counter-strategy seems to be assuring allies such as South Korea and Japan that the US still has their back, while getting North Korea's main ally, China , to economically pressure Pyongyang back to the bargaining table. Chinese President Xi Jinping 's calculus is different. Beijing-Pyongyang relations have troughed, but a collapse of the hermit nation could send refugees spilling northwards and land American troops on China's doorstep. That's a recipe for trouble at Trump-Xi talks from November 8 onwards, Leland Miller, cofounder and CEO of China Beige Book, a data consultancy on the world's second-biggest economy, told Al Jazeera. "Many Trump administration officials believe that Beijing has to help solve the North Korea problem. Not be helpful, but solve the problem. And there's no easy solution to this, certainly not one that China will find acceptable and low cost," Miller said. US-China relations Trump's stop in Beijing is being billed as a "state visit plus" to mark the importance of the dynamic between himself and President Xi, as well as relations between the US superpower and China's fast-growing economy and armed forces. North Korea is not the only glitch. Trump rails against the United States' "embarrassing" $347bn trade deficit with China, and has accused Beijing of manipulating its currency, rigging markets, and pilfering ideas from US firms. According to Miller, the two leaders may be able to paper over the cracks by unveiling a few energy deals this month, but that would only be a "calm before the storm" and the "escalation of tensions" next year. "The Trump administration has high expectations from China, a fundamental reordering of the trade relationship, while China expects a relatively painless negotiation process," Miller said. Meanwhile, the two leaders are in different positions. Xi has just emerged from a glowing five-yearly Communist Party congress; Trump has low approval ratings of 34 percent and is battling a probe about election collusion with Russia. Former CIA analyst Christopher Johnson compared Xi's "strong position with no visible domestic opposition" to Trump's routinely questioned style and legislative record. "This gives Xi a bit of a leg up" when bartering, Johnson told Al Jazeera. New Asia-Pacific policy Former US President Barack Obama tried to "rebalance" the US' defence and economic policy to counter China's rise, including with a 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal that excluded Beijing. Trump scrapped TTP almost as soon as he entered the White House in January. Amy Searight, a former Pentagon official, told Al Jazeera the "lack of any replacement with a proactive trade policy or economic agenda" has left Washington's Asian partners feeling anxious. The property magnate is expected to unveil a new framework at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Da Nang, Vietnam , on November 10. White House officials talk up plans for a "free and open Indo-Pacific region". Although big questions about the policy remain, a recommitment to rules-based economic fairness may be a solid message, Lindsey Ford, a former Department of Defense official, told Al Jazeera. "It's important for people to hear that America First does not mean Asia last; that American prosperity can go hand in hand with Asian prosperity," said Ford, an analyst at the Asia Society Policy Institute, a think-tank. Keeping allies sweet The first two stopovers are Washington's key allies in Northeast Asia: Japan and South Korea. They have both been rattled by a wildcard president who threatened to upend a global order the US had underpinned for decades. Trump has spoken of raining "fire and fury" on North Korea - rhetoric that nudges the region towards a potentially calamitous conflict. He may well tone that down a notch when addressing the National Assembly in Seoul on November 8. He may also be wise to offer some goodies. The United States' pull-out from TPP came as China was rolling out its multibillion-dollar "Belt and Road" infrastructure development plan across Asia and beyond. According to Ford, the expected Asia policy must provide a new "economic vision, post-TPP". Simply renegotiating a bilateral trade with South Korea, and vaunting new ones with Japan and Vietnam, is not enough. Trump being Trump Trump's biggest challenge could be the one thing he cannot seem to change: himself. He is prone to undiplomatic language that plays badly with buttoned-down Asian officials. Previously on Twitter, he accused South Korea of trying to "appease" its northern neighbour, and criticised Xi for not doing enough to rein in Pyongyang. {articleGUID} The trip is longer and tougher than his first foreign venture to the Middle East in May. He may get irked by Japanese resentment over a US military base in Okinawa, or rallies against the "war maniac" US president on the streets of South Korea. "Among government officials, there are going to be a lot of white-knuckles and held breath throughout the two days of his time in South Korea," Scott Snyder, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank, told Al Jazeera. There is a risk of clashing egos when Trump meets Rodrigo Duterte , the hard-boiled president of the Philippines, on November 13. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin will attend APEC, shifting the spotlight back on to the troublesome probe of election collusion. China is a safer bet, said Elizabeth Economy, author of The Third Revolution, a book about modern China. Thanks to a government block on Twitter, Trump's time there could "turn out to be 36 hours of drama-free [from] tweeting," she told Al Jazeera.

"Based on his record, I am confident that [he] has the wisdom and leadership to guide our economy through any challenges that our great economy may face." In accepting the nomination, Powell said he would "do everything" in his power to fulfil his role of making prices stable and maximise employment. "In the years since the global financial crisis ended, our economy has made substantial progress towards full recovery. By many measures, we are close to full employment; inflation has gradually moved up toward our target," he said. He also said that the country's financial situation is "far stronger and more resilient" than it was during the crisis in 2008. Before the announcement, Powell served as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. A registered Republican, he was appointed to his board position in 2012 by Democratic President Barack Obama . {articleGUID} PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Powell had also served as an undersecretary of the US Department of Treasury, and several private financial institutions, including the Global Environment Fund, a private equity firm that invests in sustainable energy. Powell, a multimillionaire, was seen as a safe pick by Trump, and the US markets and dollar index remained steady as the announcement was made. According to a Bloomberg News analysis, Powell's personal wealth could be worth as much as $112.3m, making him "the wealthiest Federal Reserve chairman in decades". With the unemployment rate at its lowest in 16 years and the economy growing, Powell is expected to maintain the policy of his predecessor. If confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, Powell will start his term in February 2018, serving at least one four-year term. By appointing Powell, Trump broke with decades-old tradition observed by previous presidents of re-appointing the chairman of the Federal Reserve.

'Jenny' began using heroin while she was in high school [Julia Galiano-Rios/Al Jazeera] Martinsburg, United States - Jenny is preparing to leave for good and says she's already cut off most of her friends to remove herself from the world of heroin addiction she once inhabited. Introduced to the drug by a close friend in high school because it was cheaper than pain pills, her habit quickly escalated. "All I was concerned about was getting high," Jenny said, recalling the times she overdosed with disbelief. Her drug dealer dumped her in a bush at a pharmacy once when she overdosed. He told her afterwards he'd thought she had died. "They were so casual, so nonchalant about it. The sad thing is I kept buying from them," said Jenny, who like other addicts interviewed for this story spoke on condition of anonymity. From the town's sheriff to addicts and their families, the people of Martinsburg said drug addiction has plagued it for decades. They blamed the proximity to cities such as Baltimore with addicts and drug dealers making the journey back and forth to buy and sell. But the impact of heroin is something new. Each week there are more overdoses and sometimes deaths and they are often in public places - from the toilets of fast food restaurants and supermarkets to hotel rooms. Martinsburg, West Virginia has one of the highest poverty rates in the US [Julia Galiano-Rios/Al Jazeera] According to figures released last week by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, heroin-related deaths have quadrupled nationwide in the US as consumption of the drug has sharply risen . The majority of heroin users, 80 percent according to the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, used prescription pain pills before trying the drug. Younger victims Dr John Burgess, who treats pain and who has spent his life in Martinsburg, told Al Jazeera health officials are increasingly seeing younger addicts. He blamed "a 'feel-good society' where the young are worried they'll miss out on something, and an incredible level of ignorance". "Now young people in our high schools do not understand the difference between heroin and drinking a few beers. They get caught in a trap before realising there is even a trap there." Burgess said the full picture of how many students are trying heroin in high schools in this region of West Virginia state isn't known - and a rate of up to 40 or 50 percent wouldn't surprise him. Some users are beginning to experiment as young as 14 years old. Some of Jenny's friends did overdose and die. She said it became normal. "You'd think it would make me want to stop using, but it made me want to use more." She said she never grieved because she was always high. With heroin "you don't get frightened, you don't get upset, you don't get emotional". Jenny couldn't explain why she got hooked. Her family, middle-class with its own business, is a stable one. Her parents, she said, are wonderful. She explained that she became dependent on pain pills after a sport injury and heroin was everywhere at school. Before they gave her an ultimatum, she had begun stealing from her parents and was dealing the drug. "I would make sales because if you sell three packs you get one for free." A year ago she did give up. Her mother, a medical professional, nursed her back to health. Her every move was supervised. There have been two short relapses, but now she is moving to another US state where no one knows she used and she'd be "mortified if they found out". Motherhood hijacked Jane became a mother for the third time while she was in prison. Her first two children were taken away from her because she was deemed unfit. Her youngest child is two and living with friends in the small town. "I shouldn't even have a little boy because of the life that I've lived. I hate not having him with me, but even when I am with him I'm not there. I don't want him to experience the life that I've lived or know anything about it." The thing that I hated the most, the thing that made me lose myself, made me lose everything, has a hold on me once again. Jane, heroin addict A heroin user for 15 years, she relapsed eight months ago after two years of being clean. Her family life and childhood were difficult. When she first used heroin, she said she felt this was how she was meant to be. "I just felt so alive when I used it. I had no fear of rejection." That euphoria has since disappeared. "I hate the person I am. I hate the things I do, how I hurt everyone around me." A few weeks ago she lost her job at a factory. In her worst periods of addiction she has turned to stealing and prostitution. She cried as she thought about reaching that point again. "The thing that I hated the most, the thing that made me lose myself, made me lose everything, has a hold on me once again. I don't know how to break free from it." It was a prescription for pain pills after a car accident last year that took her back to the drug. She hadn't told the doctor of her addiction history. She said when she began using again she realised how commonplace heroin is. "Schools, the mall, even in homes for the elderly. They're finding needles on kids' playing yards." Many blame a lack of opportunity in the US state with poverty levels higher than the national average . Jane recognises she is at a crossroads again. When she last quit, she said it was religion that saved her. An ugly end A few weeks ago her boyfriend John, also a heroin addict, saved her life. "She slid off the bed. I checked her pulse and she wasn't breathing. I prayed to God ... I held her nose and took a deep breath and blew into her mouth, and the moment I did she [gasped for air] and sat up," he said. Jane admitted being with John made stopping all the more harder. Both said medical help only works if it's available in the exact moment an addict decides to quit. "There's a waiting list and they say we'll see you next year at this time." Jane was tortured by the knowledge of what may come. "I already know the end result, what's going to happen. I'm going to end up dying or in prison." Jack Riley, chief of operations at the Drug Enforcement Administration, agreed with that prediction. He described the challenge he and other law enforcement officers face. "There is a prescription drug epidemic unlike any we've ever seen," Riley told Al Jazeera. "That cannot be separated out from the growth of heroin in the US. At some point that supply [of prescription drugs] becomes too expensive, the medicine cabinet is empty, they can't get it on the street and the next move is the dark road to cheap, very, very potent heroin that's available in all of our big cities and all of our small cities across the country." His greatest concern is that so many US communities aren't prepared for heroin's arrival. He said, from local police to community leaders, teachers and most importantly parents, everyone must play their part. Painkiller crisis Dr Burgess, who advocates alternative methods for the treatment of pain, said the medical community, too, must play its role. He said the lessons of the crisis created by prescription painkiller Oxycontin when it was introduced 20 years ago still haven't been learned.

"Everybody was introduced to this strong narcotic. People were on massive doses. Even experienced drug-addicts were blown away. There is still without question overprescribing of pain medication. It's a quick fix and has been promoted in American culture. Most medical insurance will only pay for drugs not alternative treatments. We treat pain with narcotics casually." According to the US Center for Disease and Prevention , in 2012 alone "healthcare providers wrote 259 million prescriptions for painkillers, enough for every American adult to have a bottle of pills". Meanwhile, according to the DEA, law enforcement officers across the US are seeing the same pattern - increased trafficking of heroin from Mexico, which is cheaper and of higher-quality. DEA's Riley said Mexican drug cartels have recognised the growing market and are expanding accordingly. Heroin is now his agency's greatest challenge, which is why, he said, it's time to stop referring to "the war on drugs". "It shouldn't be called a war, because that suggests there is a beginning and an end." SOURCE: Al Jazeera ABOUT THE AUTHOR Matt Chandler Addiction Drugs Prescription drugs Mexico United States
Jackie cradles her infant in a room at one of the sober houses [Abigail Higgins/Al Jazeera] Zanzibar, Tanzania - Jackie held her one month old child to her chest. If for no other reason, the new life pressed against her had to be why she stopped using. After eight years of heroin addiction, she 'd been clean for three weeks. "Let me be clear, this isn ' t my first time in a sober house," she said from a treatment centre in Zanzibar, an island off the coast of Tanzania where, according to the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar, an estimated 7 percent of the one million residents are drug addicts. This is one of the highest rates in the world. Jackie ' s determined that this will be her last time. "The first fix is not the solution, I ' m staying clean for myself and for my baby. I don ' t want to lose her, I can ' t stay sane if I know she ' s being raised by another person." Jackie, whose surname has not been published to protect her privacy, has been in and out of treatment centres seven times. Zanzibar has launched an aggressive campaign to deal with its drug problem but everyone is confounded by how to help female addicts such as Jackie, whose treatment always seems to end the same way - back on the streets using. In the 1990s, international drug smuggling routes began moving heroin from Afghanistan through East Africa ' s poorly regulated ports on the way to the US and Europe. Drug-trafficking routes have shifted to Africa's coast, introducing cheap drugs to locals [Reuters] It wasn't long before dirt-cheap narcotics leaked into the population - affordable even for the more than 40 percent of the population living below the poverty line . The help available to addicts in Zanzibar is rare in the rest of Africa, where only one in 18 drug users have access to help services, as compared to one in three in North America . This has drawn addicts from across East Africa and as far as Oman to seek help. Zanzibar has a network of 11 sober houses that have treated more than 3,000 people, harm-reduction programmes for those still using, daily 12-step meetings around the island, and for the past two months, a methadone clinic. But women are slipping through the cracks of these services. Only one of the methadone clinic ' s 30 or so patients is a woman, and while the men ' s sober houses range from 20 to 30 who recover, the two women ' s clinics have only three or four who kick the habit. "Everywhere you go you see this phenomenon of women not getting to treatment, or they drop out of treatment, and if you ask them why they say they are uncomfortable, they say, 'we ' re stigmatised and we have no services that address our needs,'" said Nabila el-Bassel a professor at Columbia University who studies female drug use. Globally, limited research exists on female drug addicts. "There is a huge, huge gap in knowledge about women who use drugs everywhere," Bassel said. "We need to stop using women as variables." Women constitute a minority of drug users, but they are likely under-reported and they also experience devastating consequences of addiction: female injection drug users face higher mortality rates, higher risks of HIV infection, and faster progression to dependency. Female drug users are stigmatised around the world but particularly in conservative Zanzibar, where 99 percent of the population is Muslim. "Traditionally, women are doubly stigmatised - being a woman and being an addict at the same time," said Abdulrahman Abdullah, the general secretary of Recovery Community Zanzibar. "Women feel embarrassed, ashamed, they ' re dealing with religion, culture, tradition, prostitution, rape." Abdulrahman Abdullah reads from Narcotics Anonymous during a 12-step meeting in Zanzibar [Abigail Higgins/Al Jazeera] Female drug users are likely to have been sexually assaulted in the past and sexually assaulted when they ' re using. Women often exchange sex for drugs, pairing two sins that make them irredeemable in the eyes of many of the island ' s residents. "When I was using I ' d go to Maskani, I wouldn ' t have anything, no money," Jackie said, referring to the place where she bought drugs. "'Don ' t worry Jackie,' they ' d say, 'I have money,' they ' d buy me drugs," she said recounting her conversation with male drug users. "Are you going to sleep with me?" Jackie recounted saying as she balanced her baby on her lap, bottle-feeding her. Women are typically introduced to injection drugs by a male partner with whom they often share needles. Injection drug user rates have ballooned to 16 percent, and among sex workers to 12.8 percent in the last decade. "Anybody can find themselves into drug addiction [but it's more likely] with traumatic effects of domestic violence, sexual assault, physical abuse, single parents," said Abdullah. "You try to cover your feelings, you try to escape." Hadija and Sandra sat outside Malaika Sober House, one of the island's two clinics for women. They had just finished a 12-step meeting and the women traded stories while smoking cigarettes. Sandra and Hadija outside Malaika Sober House, one of the island's two centres for women [Abigail Higgins/Al Jazeera] Stretched across the door step was a woman who periodically groaned as the pain of withdrawal rustled her consciousness. This is Hadija's second time at Malaika, she relapsed a few months ago after staying sober for more than two years. "We started to establish the women ' s programme in 2011 and very few have sustained recovery, more have collapsed along the way," Abdullah said of the women ' s sober houses. "Its been a good programme with very few clients." Sandra misses her two children. It is illegal for children to be in sober houses in Zanzibar, a barrier for many women. "For now, they ' re better off without me, especially the youngest one," Sandra said. "Oh god, I used to take her with me to places where people smoked dope.

RenderPagesVideo('4736374298001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Seoul, South Korea - A young woman is hunched over a toilet bowl in a coffee shop in downtown Seoul, her dishevelled hair masking her face. A police officer tries to rouse her, but there is no response. "I think she's totally passed out," says Officer Hazel Chang. Chang and her colleague carry the woman to their car, and take her to the police station where medics examine her and officers phone her parents. It is just one of many alcohol-fuelled incidents the police see during a typical night on the streets of Seoul, the South Korean capital, where people can be seen staggering about precariously and veering dangerously into traffic. Here, alcohol is an essential part of daily life for many, with South Koreans drinking more hard liquor than anyone else in the world , according to the research firm Euromonitor. It is cheap, considered a must if you want to get ahead in business and viewed as a way to relieve stress in a society with some of the world's longest working hours. But South Korea is also home to more alcoholics than any other country, and alcohol-related social costs amount to more than $20bn a year, Ministry of Health and Welfare estimates show. Every few days, Suh Seung-Beom, a banker in Seoul, gets business contacts and friends together for drinking sessions. Like most Koreans, their drink of choice is soju, a spirit made from rice. On a recent night out, it was not long before Suh and his associates were feeling the effects of the potent liquor. But he denies that getting drunk is the goal of these marathon drinking sessions. "It's just a means to build bonds in business and with people. At work we can't be so open. But here we can make memories," he tells Al Jazeera. One of Suh's drinking partners, Brent Lee, does not believe that he and his friends drink too much. He says drinking alcohol is beneficial to society because it helps people relieve stress. The police officers who patrol Seoul's busiest entertainment district disagree. 'I think drinking is a problem' Their beat is the busiest in the country, and almost every call they get involves someone who has drunk too much. Officer Chang, a former schoolteacher, has been shocked by the level of drinking she has encountered since joining the force two months ago. "I think drinking is a problem … a big problem," she says. South Korean police carry an unconscious drinker out of a coffee shop in Seoul, South Korea. Managers of the shop say she came in drunk, and when she passed out, her friends left her [Steve Chao/Al Jazeera] Officer Chang's partner, Choi Kyung-reol , says in recent years there has been an increase in the number of calls police receive involving people who have drunk too much . "We're especially seeing more women taking to the bottle heavily. It's really heartbreaking," says Officer Choi. "I don't see us making much difference out here. People are drinking and partying harder. And often in cases when we intervene to help, they get violent." Public health experts say part of the problem is that there are no laws restricting binge drinking. Knocked out On average, South Koreans consume 14 shots of hard liquor a week, while Americans drink about three and Russians about six, according to Euromonitor statistics. "It leads to all kinds of illnesses including liver disease, yet there are no government guidelines to say how much is too much," says Chun Sung-soo, from the Korea Public Health Association. Chun says there is a lack of awareness about the health risks of drinking heavily. After public pressure, South Korea's government is considering banning celebrities under the age of 24 from appearing in liquor ads [Steve Chao/Al Jazeera] He says the government invests only a small fraction of what it makes in taxes from the sale of alcohol in public awareness campaigns. "For 20 years, we've been proposing policies that can drastically reduce alcohol consumption - like increasing the price, regulating how much is sold, limiting ads … but they never pass in the national assembly," he says. Chun believes politicians are under pressure from liquor companies not to take action. One man taking on the big liquor firms is Kim Jin. Kim is the first in Korea to launch a class-action lawsuit against firms using celebrities in advertisements to promote alcohol. "People obviously look at these advertisements and see celebrities downing liquor. Because they're so famous, naturally this encourages consumers to drink more. It leads to overdrinking and people getting knocked out." 'A culture of drinking to excess' Ham Soonbok, aka the 'Bomb Shot Aunty', is known to hold legendary drinking parties at her restaurant. Many come from all over South Korea to try her various cocktails [Steve Chao/Al Jazeera] Kim knows better than most the consequences of drinking too much. He has been an alcoholic for decades, spent all his earnings on liquor and lost his marriage. "Whenever I started drinking, I wouldn't eat or drink anything else. I'd just keep downing liquor for 40 days straight. I often ended up in hospital and couldn't work. In the end … I lost my wife," he says. He now suffers from cirrhosis of the liver, a chronic condition caused by overdrinking. But he admits that he is still drinking. While Kim offers a cautionary tale, Korea's younger generation shows no sign of letting go of the culture of drinking to excess. Jiyeon Shin, a university student, says she usually goes out drinking five times a week with friends. She often studies 18 hours a day and says stress is what drives her and her friends to drink. "I think maybe now I've become a bit of an alcoholic," she says. "It's usually me who initiates the drinking and it often ends up with throwing up and hangovers." Asked whether she could ever imagine a day when South Koreans drink less, Jiyeon is adamant. "Absolutely not. Liquor is something that's naturally shared between friends and family. I think Korean drinking culture is very uplifting. So I don't think the day we have less will ever come … nor should it." From the documentary "South Korea's Hangover."

The author's mother in London, 1977, when she worked as a senior house office in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital [Courtesy of Sanam Maher] FAST FACTS: DRUG USE IN PAKISTAN There are 8.9 million substance abusers in Pakistan According to a 2013 UNODC survey, around 1.6 million people misused prescription opioids Pakistan has one of the highest rates of opiate use in the world The non-medical use of pharmaceutical drugs was found to be higher among women Karachi, Pakistan - Before I saw my mother in May, I had been dreading the meeting. I had no idea what to expect. She was angry and resentful the last time I saw her. She had been cloistered inside a rehabilitation facility in Karachi since late 2015 and was fiercely resisting treatment. Soon after she arrived, her team of carers - a psychiatrist, the founders of the rehabilitation centre and her "psychological rehabilitation person" - had wanted to change tack and cut off all contact with the family. She has to feel that there is no way out of here except through us, they said. She was furious at the bind she found herself in - admitted to the facility by her family, and unable to voluntarily opt out of the programme. She wanted to leave and couldn't understand why we wouldn't allow it. It isn't her first stint in rehab, but it is the first place where she cannot bully, argue or sweet-talk her way out. There are guards at the gate here. I am told to wait in a conference room on the ground floor. A woman walks down the stairs. There's a shaft of afternoon sunlight at her back and I can't make out her face. But she has the shuffling, slow gait that I know well - her feet drag with each step, her head droops. I brace myself. But then the woman moves out of the light and I see that it's not her. WATCH: Breaking bad habits: Mindful addiction recovery When my mother does appear, the first thing I notice are her high, full cheekbones. Last time, they were anchored by puffiness. I'm surprised by the significant amount of weight she has lost. "How are you?" she asks, as she reaches out for a hug. It's a simple question, but not one that she has asked in a very long time. Her hair is combed. She wears berry-coloured lipstick. Her clothes are clean and ironed. She sits beside me at the table and leans forward. "You're looking very nice," she says. "Your hair has grown so much!" Has it? I am embarrassed by the attention. You look nice too, I tell her bashfully. "How is your work at the magazine?" she prompts. "I stopped working at the magazine in 2011," I remind her. She pauses. The hair, the job - she remembers me as I was five years ago. The author with her mother in Karachi around 1987 [Courtesy of Sanam Maher] Before and after My mother is one of the millions of addicts or substance abusers in Pakistan. My sisters and I brought her to this rehabilitation centre, The Recovery House (TRH), in the last week of December. As 2015 wound down to a close, her driver found her early one morning on the kitchen floor, unconscious from an apparent overdose of prescription medication. We didn't know what she had taken, or how long she had been unconscious. After a certain number of hours, it is too late to pump someone's stomach. We were told she had been lying on the floor for longer than that. READ: The rise of Pakistan's 'burger' generation My mother has never made peace with her childhood. Her resentment at being left behind in Pakistan as a young girl, raised by relatives while her parents travelled the world for work, festered for decades. Her doctors say her depression, and later her substance abuse, find their roots there. She would get high, she tells me now, because she wanted to be numb. "I thought, 'I'll overcome the pain,'" she explains. "Problems didn't exist when I would get high." My mother's dependence on painkillers and sleeping pills crept up on her. I thought, 'I'll overcome the pain' ... Problems didn't exist when I would get high. The author's mother As a teenager who suffered from frequent headaches, she grew to like the relief simple painkillers like paracetamol offered, reaching a point where she would sometimes "fake" a headache in order to be given the medicine. She liked the small buzz she got, she once explained. A little over a decade ago, the headaches became debilitating migraines, and she was prescribed a stronger painkiller - an opioid analgesic - which needed to be injected. At what point did the migraines ease while the prescription continued to be filled? I cannot remember. I can only recall before and after. Before: I am seven years old and have a pair of purple and white roller skates, bought on a trip to London in 1992. My mother holds me by the hands and propels me through Hyde Park. In Karachi, we celebrate Christmas every year in honour of my Christian nanny with a small fake fir and snow that comes out of a spray can. My mother is Pakistan's first female maxillofacial surgeon and when I take a fall into an empty swimming pool and split open my chin, she stitches it up so deftly I barely feel a thing. She gives me a boomerang from her travels to Australia with the World Health Organization because I don't cry. After: Those hands are unable to operate because they are so swollen from the medication she injects herself with. She misses birthdays because she is "unwell". She begins to eat the same paan slaked with the addictive and euphoric mix of tobacco and areca nut that she researched for years as one of the first to uncover its inevitable link to oral cancer. I am 17 and living in London, waiting each day for a phone call from Karachi after she tries to kill herself and ends up on a ventilator in the ICU. She loses track of days, months and then years, not knowing when her five daughters graduate from college or begin working. In 2014, she is "unwell" and misses my wedding.

She grew up in this city, living with relatives while her parents travelled for work [Courtesy of Sanam Maher] Opiate abuse and government neglect There are 8.9 million substance abusers in Pakistan today, and the number is steadily rising. In less than three years, 2.2 million people became new users. According to a 2013 survey on drug use in Pakistan by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, or UNODC, an estimated 1.6 million people misused prescription opioids, taking them for non-therapeutic purposes, without doctors' advice or orders. RELATED: My father, a Pakistani prisoner of war in India The UNODC 2014 World Drug Report confirmed that the prevalence of opiate use in Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan was among the highest globally, and in Pakistan, had risen from 0.7 percent in 2006 to 1 percent in 2013. In five countries including Pakistan, the non-medical use of pharmaceutical drugs was found to be higher among women , who buy medication such as Xanax or Lexotanil to counter everything from anxiety, stress and insomnia to marital problems and weight gain. The medication is often doled out to friends as well. The Drugs Act of 1976 regulates the sale, manufacture, storage and distribution of such drugs in Pakistan and prohibits the sale of certain drugs without a prescription. My mother's habit, however, spiralled out of control within a system that made it possible to buy a butterfly needle with bread at the nearest general store - no questions asked. The 2013 UNODC survey revealed that those wanting to seek treatment for addiction in Pakistan deemed private treatment centres to be more effective; only 20 percent said they would trust a government facility. Yet, a staggering 99.7 percent of those surveyed simply cannot afford the treatment they need. Even as an estimated 700 Pakistanis die each day from drug-related complications - even more than the number of lives lost to attacks by armed groups, an estimated 39 a day - the government severely neglects the health sector. In the last financial year, it spent only 4 rupees (about 4 cents) on each addict's healthcare or rehabilitation, or 0.42 percent of the 26.8bn rupees (about $256m) allocated to health in the federal budget. On June 3, the government announced the proposed budget for 2016-2017. In its current form, spending on health has been slashed, with less than 1 percent of the budget, or 24.95bn rupees (about $239m), to go towards healthcare. In comparison, defence spending is up by 11 percent, with 860.1bn rupees ($8.2bn) allocated to this sector. "There is no proper policy for maintaining rehabilitation centres in the country," the director general of the Anti-Narcotics Force, Major-General Khawar Hanif, told parliamentarians in 2015. We learned how there is "no proper policy" from one facility in Lahore where patients live in such squalor that my mother emerged without drugs in her system, but with a head full of lice. Another institute in the same city handcuffs patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms to their beds. One facility with branches in Islamabad and Lahore bases its treatment on a regimen of prayers five times a day, spiritual counselling and Quranic education. My mother's experience taught me that in Pakistan it is not enough to want treatment. Finding it is the first of many hurdles to recovery. According to the UNODC survey , 99 percent of respondents said there were no inpatient treatment options they could access where they lived. For the lucky ones with facilities in their area, 87.1 percent of respondents said there weren't any available slots. It's a common refrain among those battling addiction, or with family members who are, even if they can afford the best healthcare available in the country. It is the reason a place like TRH exists. The Recovery House: Treating substance abuse and mental illness Six years ago, three siblings who were unable to find a suitable rehabilitation facility for two family members suffering from mental illness founded the small 15-bed facility. As a psychiatric rehabilitation centre, TRH works on the premise that substance abuse problems can be symptomatic of untreated or mismanaged psychological or psychiatric issues. TRH is the first place where my mother has received treatment from people who understand how a psychiatric illness and an addiction can tear through the lives of those who love her. WATCH No Place Like Home: The journey of a Pakistani migrant worker Dr Shahida Mirza, a retired major and now the director of TRH, is one such person. A gynaecologist by training, she first arrived at the institute with an MBA and a desire to work in administration, but with little understanding of addiction and rehabilitation. "I hadn't really encountered mental illness before I came here, and I used to think it was just an excuse for people to overreact to things," she recalls. She changed her mind once she witnessed patients having psychotic episodes. The real turning point came when she heard the stories of parents who brought their children to TRH for addiction treatment. "It all sounded so familiar to me when I looked at my son [who was then about 15] and how he was behaving," she says. "I began to wonder, is my son doing drugs? If this can happen to someone else's child then why not mine?" A urine test confirmed the presence of opioids in her son's system, and he admitted to using heroin and smoking hashish. As TRH only accepts patients diagnosed with an underlying psychiatric or psychological disorder, Dr Mirza’s son did not qualify for treatment there. My son soon became one of the zombies there. Dr Shahida Mirza, director of TRH "My son was desperate to stop using, but he was scared of the withdrawal symptoms," she says. "He was admitted to a rehab in Lahore, but they didn't believe in weaning him off the heroin with replacement drugs, saying it is equivalent to killing the patient slowly with poison." When patients couldn't control the side effects of going cold turkey, body builders hired by the rehab would pin them down while a staff member administered a sedative. "My son soon became one of the zombies there," Mirza recalls. The author's mother with her first child in East Ham, London, 1977, a few months after moving to the UK for work [Courtesy of Sanam Maher] No evolution in how addiction is treated Dr Uzma Ambareen, the medical director at TRH, has been practising psychiatry in Pakistan since 1998. In her opinion, the approach to treating addiction in the country hasn't evolved in those 18 years, with most medical practitioners or rehabilitation institutes focusing only on curbing the substance abuse or detoxing in this way rather than understanding what feeds the addiction. The method all but ensures a high rate of relapse, she says. "Most people in Pakistan, and this includes doctors, believe that using or abusing a substance is a choice and it is within your control," Dr Ambareen explains. "If you're an addict, they think you're being indulgent. You're being bad and you can stop, but you're choosing not to." After his third relapse, Mirza's son refused to return to rehab. She combed the country for a facility that could help him. She found that while many followed the practices of his former rehab, some did not allow her to enter the facility to see what it was like. Ultimately, she decided to help her son herself. Under the supervision of a psychiatrist, she detoxed her son at home. Most people in Pakistan, and this includes doctors, believe that using or abusing a substance is a choice and it is within your control. Dr Uzma Ambareen, medical director at TRH "I don't even want to recall how difficult it was," she says. For the first 24 hours, she held her son's convulsing body and prayed for the replacement drugs to work. When he attempted to leave the house to buy heroin, she decided to drive him to his dealer and administer his drugs herself. After a few months of sobriety, he relapsed once again. "I just couldn't go through the process once more, and I took him to an institute in Thailand where he could get the treatment he needed," she says. After eight months and $40,000 in loans to pay for the rehabilitation, her 25-year-old son has been clean for the longest period since he was 16 years old. The key, she feels, was the intensive therapy process that helped him understand the roots of his addiction. TRH takes its cues from this form of rehabilitation, focusing on psychological and social interventions rather than chemical or pharmacological ones. Thus, patients, or "clients" as they are referred to, spend their days not just in group and solo therapy sessions, but in gardening, music, and computer classes. There are trips to the beach and a bowling alley. "The idea is to work with patients with long-term chronic disorders, beyond medications," Ambareen explains. "We want to get them as close to where they were before the onset of their illness, and to restore their functionality to as close to 100 percent as possible." The process, she says, can take months, and even then TRH cannot guarantee that the patient will not relapse. TRH insists that patients are "for life" - they must touch base with the facility after they leave to stay on track. Ambareen is hesitant to quantify the facility's "success rate", explaining, "There are successes and I guess what you would call 'failures', but you have to remember that the illness itself is characterised by relapses. And the risk of relapse in patients with substance abuse is very, very high." The author's mother in Piccadilly Circus, London, pregnant with her oldest daughter. This photograph was taken shortly after she arrived in the city from Karachi [Courtesy of Sanam Maher] Families stop expecting much Unfortunately, many patients are pulled out of the facility by family members who believe there isn't much to be gained from long-term treatment. "Most people here do not understand the concept of psychiatric rehabilitation," Ambareen feels. "We're living in a country where most psychiatrists don't even get it, let alone other doctors or families." "Most of the time the family just wants the person's symptoms to be controlled," she says. "Once the patient is not being violent and eating three meals a day, the family says that is adequate. They stop expecting much." With little understanding of the concept of rehabilitation, families accuse doctors of ulterior motives for wanting to keep treating a patient - the monthly fee of 125,000 rupees (about $1,200) for inpatient treatment. "They think we're out to make money," Ambareen says. "We may feel the patient is just at the beginning of their rehabilitation, and can go on to become productive, get a job, or be in a relationship, but the family has given up on that a lot of the time." While TRH tries to educate families about the nature of psychiatric disorders or addiction, many parents refuse to attend sessions. Once the patient is not being violent and eating three meals a day, the family says that is adequate. They stop expecting much. Dr Uzma Ambareen, medical director at TRH "They are scared of people finding out that they come here or that their son or daughter has a problem," Mirza says. "They worry that their other children will be judged or will not receive marriage proposals if word gets out." All patients who leave the facility are strongly urged to follow up, but Ambareen has found that those who have been prematurely pulled out of the programme, and especially those with chronic relapses, rarely do. Instead, they are often committed to long-term mental hospitals, as many people believe mental illness or addiction cannot be treated or managed. TRH donors currently sponsor some patients. The goal is to expand the facility to a 50-bed space, with 30 percent of the beds free of cost. In five years, Mirza hopes that the foundation is able to create a "recovery village", with small apartments for patients who cannot return to their families, or who wish to live independently. "One of our greatest problems is where do clients go once their treatment is complete?" Mirza explains. "Sometimes, the family will not want a recovered addict - especially those with underlying psychiatric problems - to return to their home," Ambareen says. "They believe the illness or disorder is contagious."

But I do know what it is like to lose someone every day. The loss is renewed with each relapse. Every schoolteacher or family friend who tried to mother my sisters and me only underscored the absence. This is not to suggest that my mother is perfect. She can be vain, foolish with money, quick-tempered, dramatic and selfish. She can be impossible to care for. It is difficult to remember her most endearing qualities. She was a woman with beautiful style; she paired hand-painted silk scarves with simple cotton shalwar kameezes and saved her Ferragamo and Ungaro purses for her daughters. That is what I remembered when we found her walking around her house without a stitch of clothing on early one morning. She was a wonderful cook, and loved to throw dinner parties, listening to ghazals as she dressed for the evening. We never hear from those dinner guests any more. My mother has no friends today. I cannot blame them. I did not talk to her for a year at one point. Those who know about her problem distanced themselves from our family; many disapproved and blamed my mother's problems on an unhappy marriage or on her children. They told my sisters and me that we would be "punished" with children who treated us just as we treated our mother. I don't know the pain of a parent's death. But I do know what it is like to lose someone every day. The loss is renewed with each relapse. Sanam Maher My mother's psychiatrist has warned us that a fatal overdose was likely. "I am very surprised that your mother is still around," Ambareen tells me. "People run out of luck a lot sooner than this." I believed my mother's addiction would end only in death, and on the worst days, I hoped that time would come soon. The pain of losing her, I thought, could not be as bad as the suffering of watching her disappear. After five months at TRH, however, my mother is a stranger to me. I learn that she loves to play Scrabble. She meticulously records details about her day in a diary. She is reading again. Every evening, a cook at TRH brings her a cup of tea and sits with her as she teaches him the English names for everything he cooks and sees in his kitchen. She uses an Urdu-to-English translation book bought on one of her trips to a bookstore. One weekend, he visited an island near Karachi. When he returned, he asked her to teach him the English words for what he saw. She taught him how to talk about the boats and fish, the sea and sky. She makes detailed plans for what she will do once she leaves TRH. Her daughters are married or live abroad, and she is separated from my father. She wonders how she will occupy her time or live alone. "We had a group session this week that I liked," she told me when I last saw her. "How to make new friends." "Tell me how," I say. "Well, it depends," she replies. "Am I at a party? What kind of gathering is it? Do I see someone I am interested in? Do they give off happy vibes or do they look nice? How do they talk? If I want to make a friend, I would approach that person, say hello and try to get to know them." She pauses. "I would tell them about myself, but not personal details. I'll wait for the time to do that." "Pretend I am a new person," I tell her. "Shall we pretend we are at a dinner party?" "No," she says. "Not a dinner party." "Hi," I say. "I'm Sanam." "Hi, Sanam," she says with a smile. "What are you doing here at the conference? Are you a speaker or a listener?" She starts laughing. "I'm a writer, actually," I say. "Oh really? Would I have read any books you've written?" "I don't write books, Mum," I say. "Give me your card," she urges, still in character. "I'll look you up. They're calling us into the session now, but can I get in touch with you later? It was really nice to meet you. I hope we meet again soon."

Freetown, Sierra Leone - The dark street corner would have been silent if not for the grumble of a motorbike. It was nearing midnight, but for Ibrahim Sesay - a 27-year-old motorbike taxi driver in Freetown - the evening had just begun. He pulled four small pills from his breast pocket, gulped them down without water and set off into the night. "Every night I take tramadol, for the past year at least," he explained, referring to the pills. "Lots of [motorbike taxi drivers] take it. It helps me stay awake while I work, but now I can't do anything without it. I have to take it when I wake up or I feel sick ... It is scares me because I don't really know what to do and I think it's getting worse." READ MORE: Drug traffic fuels addiction in Sierra Leone Sesay said he had never heard of tramadol - a cheap, opioid painkiller with stimulating effects - until last year's holiday season, when a fellow rider offered him one of the green capsules before a long shift. He started taking just one 225-milligram pill a day, but as continuous use strengthened both his tolerance and dependence, he gradually came to crave higher amounts. Now he takes 900 milligrams, more than twice the recommended maximum daily dosage, and likens the withdrawal symptoms to a heavy bout of malaria.

What was until recently a little-known prescription-only medication for treating chronic pain has in the past two years been at the centre of a rapidly expanding addiction crisis in Sierra Leone - a country with virtually no avenues for drug rehabilitation and which remains haunted by an 11-year civil war during which there were high rates of drug abuse among combatants. Propelled by a black market network of importers and sold cheaply under the table by private pharmacies, the problem has become so bad that in August 2016, Sierra Leone's overwhelmed pharmaceutical regulators declared tramadol abuse a public health emergency. In the 25 years since it was launched on the global market, tramadol dependence has spread through parts of Southeast Asia, the Middle East, North and West Africa and Europe. Fuelled by inaction from international regulators and a steady stream of the product from India and China's swelling generic medication industries, pills imported by unstable or under-regulated countries can be easily be diverted to armed groups or smugglers who move it across the globe. Tramadol is believed to be sold under the table without prescriptions by street hawkers and in local pharmacies in Sierra Leone [Cooper Inveen/Al Jazeera] While some countries - including China, Sweden, Australia and the United States - have placed tramadol under their own national controls, the lack of international regulations helps amplify many of the challenges with regulating pharmaceuticals in developing countries such as Sierra Leone, potentially opening the door to a dangerous opioid love affair in the world's poorest communities. "If things continue as they have been going, we should expect more of the same," said Pierre Lapaque, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime's West Africa representative. "People buy it because it's cheap, yes, but also because it just makes them feel better. It's a vicious cycle ... It's a commodity at the end of the day, and as long as you have someone willing to buy it, there will be someone willing to sell it." READ MORE: Palestinian refugees struggle with drugs Tramadol first hit the West German market in 1977 , after a series of experiments conducted by former Nazi scientist Ernst-Gunther Schenck found the drug to be a safer, non-addictive substitute for heavy painkillers such as morphine when injected. The World Health Organization reaffirmed the drug's "low abuse liability" 15 years later, and in 1995 it was FDA-approved, subsequently launching tramadol on to the international market in its common capsule form.

When taken orally in high amounts, University of Kentucky addiction researchers wrote in 2012 that tramadol produces similar effects to OxyContin. Amid growing evidence of abuse risk, the United States Drug Enforcement Agency revised their position in 2014 , rescheduling the drug as a Schedule IV narcotic. Yet, in he same year the WHO opted not to review tramadol's status for the fourth time since its international debut, this time because of how many tramadol users had prior histories of substance abuse and how few developed countries report abusive or addictive behaviour. Meanwhile, tramadol's addictive qualities were becoming undeniable in parts of the developing world. Tramadol was involved in nearly half of all drug arrests in Gaza in 2009 , and the next year Hamas officials burned nearly two million tablets that had been seized from smugglers making their way from Egypt. In January 2016, more than 25,000 kilos of Tramadol that had been mislabelled as bed sheets were intercepted by Greek authorities while en route from India to a holding company in Libya with suspected ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS). READ MORE: Egypt's wave of painkiller addiction In 2014 , Egypt, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritius, Saudi Arabia and Togo all reported widespread Tramadol dependence to the WHO. "The danger is that tramadol isn't listed internationally with popular narcotics such as morphine or OxyContin," said Ethelbert Tejan, president of Sierra Leone's Pharmaceutical Business Owners Association. "If it was listed, it would force governments' hands to try to solve the problem in their own countries, but as of now it's not listed with other harmful narcotics and psychotropics." "We have to limit the accessibility options to just private hospitals and specialty clinics, and try to engage medical professionals in finding an alternative to Tramadol that can be imported instead." Tramadol is only legally available in Sierra Leone with a doctor's prescription and only a small handful of pharmacies are permitted to carry it at all. Yet Tejan and others describe a thriving parallel market for illegal tramadol - pills that are smuggled into Sierra Leone across the country's highly unregulated borders or sold under the table without prescriptions by street hawkers and in neighbourhood pharmacies. Sierra Leone does not have any drug rehabilitation centers to treat tramadol addicts [Cooper Inveen/Al Jazeera] "Right now our biggest problem is people having access to the illegal tramadol, either through peddlers on the streets or pharmacies abusing their privileges," said Wilshire Johnson, the president of Sierra Leone's pharmacy board. "And it's sold cheap, 10 capsules for often less than a pint of beer. We've tried to put in place stronger regulatory mechanisms, which have worked in certain areas, but there are also a lot of hard-to-reach places, and [the pharmacy board] just doesn't have the capacity to identify everyone going around the system."

While some gang members interviewed for this story did admit to pairing tramadol with alcohol, law-abiding citizens also confessed to daily use, with reasons ranging from increased sexual performance to pain relief during long bouts of manual labour. To Tejan, the solution is a matter of political willpower. He believes Sierra Leone's legal tramadol is imported at a significantly higher rate than it is prescribed and that efforts to sensitise affected communities about tramadol's addictive qualities, such as a recent radio campaign, tend to fall short of expectations, often targeting people like college students who have been shown to be less prone to abuse than members of poorer communities. "Sierra Leone has around seven million people with about two thirds relying on traditional herbal remedies and only a third or less even making use of pharmaceutical retailers," Tejan said. "If you have 10 importers for a product that is not widely prescribed medically, you have to start asking questions. It's not a safety risk to limit a product that is not fast moving, so if we can begin to control the importers I believe we will have gone 75 percent of the way." OPINION: The battle of Cairo\'s Muhammad Mahmoud Street Even if the flow of tramadol into Sierra Leone can be limited, treatment availability remains poor. The country doesn't have any drug rehabilitation centres, and with the average Sierra Leonean making less than $2 a day, most addicts will opt to deal with their illness independently before risking money on personalised treatment in the country's overworked and understaffed government hospitals. Others, such as Ibrahim Sesay, are looking for any opportunity to kick their habit. All he needs, he said, is for someone to point him in the right direction. "It scares me how much I want it, how much I need it to live my life," he said, gripping his handlebars. "All I really want is a way out."

The People's Harm Reduction Alliance needle exchange in Seattle's University District links drug users with community support and clean needles [Emily Mulder/Al Jazeera] Seattle, King County, United States - Shilo Murphy sat in his small, cluttered office inside the United Methodist Church in Seattle's University District where he has distributed clean syringes in the back alley for more than 16 years. The 41-year-old local is a heroin user himself and now directs the needle exchange, People's Harm Reduction Alliance, where he connects drug users to community support, clean injection equipment, infection testing, and education for safer drug use. After record-high fatal heroin overdoses in King County in recent years, the city of Seattle asked for Murphy's input on how to address opioid addiction in the area. A decision was later reached by Seattle and King County to build the nation's first safe injection facility (SIF) , a clean and safe space where users can consume drugs under medical supervision. "I've watched my family and friends die a very preventable death through overdose," Murphy says. "[SIFs] are going to promote a culture of safety and a culture of people not dying ... they get people off the streets and also connect people to services." At least two pilot sites - also referred to as safe consumption sites or Community Health Engagement Locations - will be implemented pending decisions on funding and location, alongside a number of harm reduction methods including increased access to buprenorphine, an opioid medication used to treat opioid addiction, and expanded distribution of naloxone (also known as Narcan), a drug that reverses overdoses. Such methods emerged from the belief that the world would never be drug-free, and have successfully reduced the harms associated with drug use globally. While unprecedented in the US, SIFs have been implemented elsewhere since the 1980s with about 90 locations in Europe , Australia, and Canada. Many SIFs have reduced fatal overdoses, increased access to healthcare and treatment for people addicted to opioids, and saved financial resources. Introducing the sites, however, has been laden with controversy and, in the Seattle area, has spurred debate around whether the sites will be effective, or legal under federal law.

Critics depict the Vancouver site as a honeypot for drug sellers and focus on harrowing scenes of street corner overdoses, fearing a mirror image in their localities.

He says the county's sites would be likely to emulate the unassuming or " low-footprint " models of Hamburg or Amsterdam rather than the oft-referenced site in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, a highly impoverished neighbourhood where drug users are highly concentrated. Noting local concerns around the sites, the Seattle Police Department's public affairs director Sean Whitcomb says it would be "absolutely" possible to establish SIFs without harming public safety. "Look at what we have now: public injection sites all over the city," Whitcomb says. "The needles in your park? Hopefully, they'll be gone because they will be safely disposed. The person who died in the restroom? Hopefully, that won't happen." Harold* is a man in his early 20s who pays regular visits to Murphy's needle exchange. He is currently homeless and says he would be "excited and glad" if there was a clean and safe space where he could use drugs, listing Seattle neighbourhoods he thought would benefit from SIFs. READ MORE: US lawmakers target undocumented student 'sanctuaries' Opposition to SIFs State Senator Mark Miloscia opposes SIFs out of fear they will set a nationwide precedent for federally facilitated heroin use. In early March, Miloscia successfully passed a bill in the state Senate to ban the sites. The bill is now under review by the state's House Health Care and Wellness Committee. Speaking over the phone from the Senate floor, Miloscia equated heroin use with criminal acts such as domestic abuse and assault. "We need to stigmatise the people hooked on heroin who refuse to go into treatment, to save their lives," Miloscia told Al Jazeera. "We need to push people into treatment, with cultural values and cultural pressure." The concept that drug use alone results in addiction - and should, therefore, be criminalised and stigmatised to keep people safe - is what physician Gabor Mate called "one of the bedrock fables sustaining the so-called war on drugs". A lot of people use drugs every day because they're in trauma. I think we should be trying to focus on healing that trauma. Shilo Murphy, People's Harm Reduction Alliance Julie Hannah, co-director of the International Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy at the University of Essex in the UK, argues that criminalisation and societal prejudice around drug use and addiction lead to the erosion of the human right to health. "There's plenty of evidence showing that when you're criminalised, it drives you away from services. It drives drug use underground, which leads to more unsafe injection, and it keeps people in need of real healthcare and support completely disconnected from those services," Hannah says. Fear of illicit drugs and addiction spurred on by decades of a war on drugs mentality has led to other rights abuses , Hannah adds. "The heavy policing of poor communities in the US, the corresponding number of drug-related arrests, and the disproportionately racist mass incarceration for drug offences emerge within this [war on drugs] context," she says. Hannah commended Seattle's move towards SIFs, hailing harm reduction approaches that "embrace evidence, health, and dignity, instead of this ideological fear-mongering". Murphy also rejects stigma and criminalisation-based approaches to curbing opioid addiction. "The number one thing that helps our participants to heal and grow is telling them that they're loved … A lot of people use drugs every day because they're in trauma. I think we should be trying to focus on healing that trauma." OPINION: Human rights - From Obama to Trump Shilo Murphy who directs a needle exchange in Seattle believes the planned safe injection facilities will promote a culture of safety and prevent deaths among drug users [Emily Mulder/Al Jazeera] Opioid addiction under the Trump administration Seattle's controversy comes amid increased focus nationwide on the country's growing opioid crisis, to which many are looking to see how this White House will respond. Chair of the Department of Psychology at Columbia University Dr Carl Hart anticipates that the Trump administration will stray from science-based approaches to public health policy when it comes to opioids. "Drug use and drug addiction have to be separated," Hart says, pointing to evidence that most people who use opioids do not become addicted, and that the majority of opioid-related deaths result from mixing opioids with other drugs. Discussion of science around addiction is lost in what Hart referred to as the US' historically "draconian approach to drugs". The US president pledged on the campaign trail and in his February 28 address to Congress to expand the use of drug courts, naloxone, and opioid treatment, but his rhetoric has weighed heavy on stopping the supply of opioids entering the country, using law enforcement. Certainly, the preliminary signal we've gotten from the administration ... is an attitude of taking a much more law enforcement-based approach to drugs. Wendy Parmet, director of Northeastern University's Program on Health Policy and Law "Certainly, the preliminary signal we've gotten from the administration ... is an attitude of taking a much more law enforcement-based approach to drugs," Wendy Parmet, director of Northeastern University's programme on Health Policy and Law, told Al Jazeera. "We need a more holistic science-based approach. If the response is a look-tough-and-get-tough-approach, I'm worried that that may not be effective," Parmet says. Trump administration policy could be destructive for Americans addicted to opioids, according to Richard Frank, professor of health economics in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) marked the first time insurance companies were required to cover substance use disorder and mental health treatments, Frank says, giving people with drug addiction the purchasing power necessary to access treatment. "If the Trump administration works to undermine the coverage expansions in the ACA then they would put at risk the gains that occurred," Frank told Al Jazeera. Frank estimates that of the 2.8 million Americans with substance use disorder who rely on the ACA for health insurance coverage, 222,000 could lose access to opioid addiction treatment if it were repealed. House Republican leaders and the White House still aim to repeal the ACA despite withdrawing legislation to do so in March. Frank told Al Jazeera that the president's plans around opioids still remain unclear. "His [Trump's] budget and policy announcements seems to at once call for more attention to opioids while making major cuts in SAMHSA's [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration] budget," Frank says. Brad Finegood of the King County Department of Community and Human Services says that a "significant portion" of the county's population with opioid addictions were low-income and currently receive treatment services from Medicaid through ACA. Seattle Mayor Ed Murray's office, meanwhile, says Trump's proposed budget includes deep cuts in federal funding to cities which would affect the city's ability to address the opioid crisis. "For decades, the federal government has slashed funding for public health, including substance use treatment - and with President Trump in the White House, cities are on their own," the office said in a statement to Al Jazeera. The Department of Health and Human Services and the White House press office did not respond to requests for comment. READ MORE: China's new opium wars: Battling addiction in Beijing Pioneer in public health Seattle advocates, however, remain hopeful that their local public health policy will continue improving support for residents addicted to opioids. Senator Miloscia requested Attorney General Jeff Sessions for federal intervention in SIFs, but power over public health has traditionally been given to state and local governments. ACLU-WA's Mark Cooke told Al Jazeera that King County and Seattle were "well within their local authority to use their public health powers" when it comes to SIFs. While no legal precedent exists for SIFs in the US, Cooke refers to analogous situations such as marijuana policy and needle exchanges, which come under state jurisdiction. Both are against federal law, but as neither have received federal intervention, Cooke believes this could be the case for SIFs. Cooke added that King County has long pioneered harm reduction approaches in public health. In the late 1980s, local activist Dave Purchase was one of the first people in the nation to start needle exchanges during the HIV/Aids epidemic. The West Coast has historically been home to proactive public health movements. Mayor Murray has pledged to call for more support from federal and state partners "to help the city try new approaches to save lives". Back at the University District needle exchange, Murphy says that while he believes in the need for SIFs, he criticises the city for dragging its feet on planning funding. "I have hope for [the SIFs], but politicians are politicians. What happens if Mayor Murray doesn't get re-elected? What happens when Trump pulls out money? ... Words are nice, but words are not going to stop people from dying in this neighbourhood," Murphy says. "I want real commitment." *Name changed for privacy SOURCE: Al Jazeera ABOUT THE AUTHOR Emily Mulder Health Politics United States Addiction
Tisa Beeler is raising her grandchildren after both of their parents fell into drugs [Josh Rushing/Al Jazeera] As the United States goes through the worst drug crisis in its history, a generation of children is being neglected, abandoned or orphaned by parents addicted to opioids. It's often the grandparents that step in to fill the void. Tisa Beeler, a 52-year-old from Chillicothe, Ohio, took over raising four grandchildren, all of them younger than 10, after both of their parents fell into drug use and the children were placed in foster care. This is her story in her own words. I never dreamed I'd be raising my grandkids. But their parents became addicted to drugs and they just kept messing up. {articleGUID} In the beginning, I was scared because I didn't know how to take care of my grandkids in a one-bedroom place. They were very out of control and angry. And dealing with their temper tantrums and their fits and their screaming, I would literally go get in the shower and cry with my clothes on for, half hour, 45 minutes or until somebody would come and calm me down and talk to me. The kids didn't deserve me yelling at them; it wasn't their fault. But everything just happened so fast. I was just alone in my life and then I get a phone call and I have to be in town to pick up four girls, with no home of my own to raise them. But I made it there in 15 minutes and I got them and I tried. I know I have to do it and that's what keeps me going. Because if I don't do it, who is going to? They're going to go back to foster care or they're going to be living in a home full of druggies and alcoholics. Tisa Beeler They were talking about giving them to four different homes for adoption. And I couldn't let that happen. It would have destroyed Kaia, the 10-year-old, to lose her three sisters. To her, they've been her babies. She's been taking care of the girls since she was two years old. When the youngest one was in diapers, she would diaper her, bathe her. She just took the role on and was mummy when everybody was drunk and stoned. She'd even become mummy to her mum and dad at some point. She'd have to tell them when to feed the kids and when to change their diapers and things like that. She doesn't know what a childhood is at all. So now, we sometimes battle over it because she still wants to be mummy and I try to get her to be a child. The girls have some trust issues, wondering who is going to stay and who is going to leave. But they're learning that grandma is here for them always and will never let them down. I don't think I've got 14 years of parenting left, my health isn't good. But I know I have to do it and that's what keeps me going. Because if I don't do it, who is going to? They're going to go back to foster care or they're going to be living in a home full of druggies and alcoholics. Sometimes, the parents are too strung out there to even realise that they have kids. I mean, they know they have them, but they don't want to deal with them because all they're doing is chasing the next high. They take their kids' food stamps; they would sell them just to buy their drugs. When the girls were little and they were still living with their parents, I would take food out of my freezer and take it to them. I quit giving them money because the money was going for drugs. I'd go buy diapers and take two or three diapers out of it so they couldn't return the bag. There's a lot of weaselling you have do around them to keep them from using you and your money. Tisa Beeler and two of her grandchildren [Josh Rushing/Al Jazeera] 'Everybody I know is some kind of drug addict' [Drug use] is very common in the city of Chillicothe. It's every day, all day long. I don't know if I could name three people that don't do drugs in Chillicothe. You walk outside and everybody's stoned and wanting to fight and argue. You can't trust your kids to go to the park without having to search the park for needles first. As you're coming into Chillicothe, we have a welcome sign and then the next sign is "Are you addicted?" No matter which direction you come into town, that is our first sign. Sometimes, their parents are too strung out there to even realise that they have kids. I mean, they know they have them but they don't want to deal with them because all they're doing is chasing the next high. Tisa Beeler I was raised here. When I was young, you ran around outside until you were about 10 years old in your underwear. You didn't hear people talking about drugs. You never listened to the news, but when you did turn the news on, you didn't see all these shootings and killings from drugs. You can't even leave your doors unlocked any more. You can't walk down the streets of Chillicothe and feel safe any more, because you never know who is going to shoot you or come after you for your money. It's a very sad place. 'It started with me and my cycle of life' My oldest son is a heroin addict, bad. My youngest one was one, too. He killed himself last summer. I've had three children that were addicts and I couldn't stop them and I still can't stop them. To lose one of them and to know that the other two are still taking drugs, it's killing me. They started out as teenagers with weed and then it went to pills, then meth, cocaine, and to heroin. They'd get high, they'd go break into people's cars. I'd find out, I'd drag them to court. I tried to teach them the right from the wrong. But when we went to court they'd get slapped on the hands and then they'd be right back doing the same stuff. I blame it on myself for the way I lived with them when they were younger. I don't know how other parents feel, but I carry my guilt for my kids. And I carry my guilt for my grandkids because it started with me and my cycle of life. My dad was an alcoholic, I married into a family of alcoholics, an abusive man. And then, after the divorce, I married a second one that was abusive and he kept pot in the house all the time. When the boys were teenagers, they found it, they got into it while I was working. If I'd put my foot down sooner, maybe they wouldn't have taken that route. I sit and watch them kill themselves every day but there's nothing I can say or do and I can't mourn for them because they are alive. But I feel sorry for them, that they can't make better choices. Tisa Beeler I don't know how to stop the drug cycle. After losing my son, I finally faced the fact: there's nothing I can do. There's nothing I can say that's going to change them. It has to come from within them and I always hope that one day they'll see what they've done and come around. I sit and watch them kill themselves every day but there's nothing I can say or do. And I can't mourn for them because they are alive. But I feel sorry for them, that they can't make better choices. So, I don't know how to stop the cycle other than to talk to my grandchildren and hope they've seen enough to not want to touch drugs. I still have the fear I'm not doing it right. I'm afraid I'm going to steer them in the wrong path or let something happen that's going to make them go that way. They're such beautiful kids and they can become beautiful adults if they can learn the right stuff. "I want them all to learn that there's different things in life to do besides follow the track of drugs," says Tisa Beeler [Josh Rushing] 'It's not the same as the mother-father love' It's sad the world the way it is today, because the children are getting love from their grandparents, but it's not the same as the mother-father love. I can remember being there, picking my boys up when they fell and skinned their knees when they were babies, cuddling them and telling them they're OK, toughen up. All mothers and fathers are supposed to do that. Not the grandparents. We're supposed to do it when we're watching them, but we should be able to give them back to their mum and dad. But today's generation, you don't get to give them back. You just get to continue to raise them and hope that you'd raise them right to where they can have a halfway decent life. However, these children are missing the hugs and the love that the parents are supposed to be giving them, while the parents also miss out by not being there. The girls' parents missed out on basketball games, they didn't get to watch the youngest take her first steps, didn't get to see the big one graduate from kindergarten - it's the little things that you don't get to do twice. I tell them it's OK because grandma's here, grandma's not going anywhere - trying to give them some stability and some security to hang on to. But no matter what I do, the kids miss out on a lot with their parents. No birthday parties, unless grandma does it. And the parents are not there; they're in jail. 'I quit dragging them to the prisons, rehabs, halfway houses' Right now, t heir mum is in Chillicothe jail and their dad's at a halfway house. {articleGUID} The girls were allowed to visit their mum in jail previously, but I've decided to quit dragging them to the prisons, the rehabs, the halfway houses. Because it tears them apart. When we visit, they're all excited to see her, but then, in the end, they want to cry because mum can't come home and the same way with dad. The oldest never wants to leave her dad. She's a daddy's girl and it just breaks her heart. It breaks my heart to see them cry and upset, so I decided I'm not going to torture the kids in that way. If one person can be saved by our story, it would be awesome. That one child is saved. If a woman would hear my story and my son's story about the kids, maybe they won't go towards drugs or maybe they'll give up drugs seeing where these kids have ended up at. These kids are growing up and they're going to be adults at some point, but what's going to be there for them? We can't say. All we can do is hope that they get a better life out of it than what their parents are doing.

Derrick Slaughter, 5, attends a march in Norwalk, Ohio against the heroin epidemic with his grandmother in July. Derrick's parents are addicts. He is being raised by his grandparents. [Getty Images] Dr John Gabis has investigated so many drug-related deaths that he stopped counting. The Chillicothe -based family medicine doctor and coroner of Ross County has had a unique insight into the opioid crisis in Ohio - counselling parents that struggle with addiction as well as investigating untimely, mostly drug-related, deaths. In 2015, the state of Ohio had one of the US' highest overdose rates; one in nine US heroin deaths happened in Ohio, according to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Heroin use is growing in popularity. In 2016, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report listing heroin as one of the 10 drugs most frequently involved in drug overdose deaths, nationwide. The report also noted a 23 percent per year increase in drug overdose deaths between 2010 and 2014. During that period, the rate of deaths involving heroin had more than tripled. Gabis, along with his team, is determined to find ways to decrease the death rate due to opiate drug overdose in Ross County. He talks to Fault Lines about the US opioid crisis and its impact on a whole generation of children growing up amid the drug epidemic. Fault Lines: As a coroner you often find yourself working with families struggling with addiction. Can you describe how heroin impacts children? John Gabis: Whenever you consider the impact on children, the impact is not whenever somebody overdoses. It's the lifestyle that they're exposed to. They're in a home where the parent may not be able to fix them meals. They may not have food in the house. {articleGUID} They may wear the same clothes to school every week. So, the impact on children is way before somebody overdoses, whether they're left alone, whether they're pawned off on friends or family. There's a lot of attachment concerns. These folks who are addicted don't stick to an eight to five regiment. You know, they sleep whenever they are tired, and the children don't have a structured life. Children thrive in structure. So, if you don't know what the cues are - it's time to get ready for bed, it's time to brush your teeth, it's time to have a bedtime story read to you - and you just sleep on the couch in your clothes whenever you feel like sleeping. That's not how children grow up healthy. There are things called adverse childhood events. It could be anything from the death of a parent, either from a drug overdose or a car accident, an incarceration of a parent, hunger, physical, sexual, or emotional abuse ... all of those things make it much more likely that you would as an adult then turn to substances to dull that pain. The impact on children is incredibly damaging. Fault Lines: How does that kind of childhood end up playing out for that child's future? Gabis: Children who go through a very difficult childhood with addiction or alcoholism or mental illness, they're more likely not to do well in school. They're more likely to become involved in the criminal justice system and they're much more likely to be addicted to a substance or abuse a substance, whether it's opiates, whether it's alcohol, whether it's marijuana, whether it's other stuff. It's an impact that we're seeing in this current generation that we'll see play out in 10 to 15 years when they're adults and we just hope that it doesn't continually repeat itself in a positive feedback cycle where one generation makes sure that the next generation will follow in their footsteps, good or bad - in this case very bad. It's concerning. It's frightening. It's sad, not only for the people who are addicts that got trapped in that, but - but for their children, for their parents, for their brothers and sisters, for their future. Fault Lines: What are some concrete ways that this hits a child whose parents are going through addiction? Gabis: How it impacts a child is they have poor nutrition. They have poor development. They have no structure. They have no bedtime. They have no expectation of what it takes to get through life. They have no predictability in their life. It's chaos all the time. Their parents are doing things that don't make sense. It's not rational. You can't talk rationality with an addict. Heroin is stronger than any human tie. It is stronger than any compelling argument. It is stronger than a religious belief. It is the devil incarnate. It is evil. It's the black plague. It's like the zombie apocalypse. It's death. Fault Lines: What role does the school play for children here? Gabis: The school environment is so critical for children. It's often their only safe haven. So, when they're at home, they're hungry, they're ignored. Their parents may be there, but they may be incapacitated by their drug use. When they're in school, they're with kids their own age. They're with a teacher who is showing interest in them. There's structure there. They know what to expect. They may have behaviour issues, but that's because they're trying to figure out the structure. I think it's unfair to the schools that they not only have to teach reading, writing, and arithmetic but now they have to teach coping skills. They have to teach how to fend for yourself on the weekend. We're going to give you a backpack full of food to go home with. You know, the schools see the destruction of that family thread or that family structure that's holding that family together. Fault Lines: I've heard people in town say, don't give them Narcan [emergency opioid overdose treatment]. Just let them die. How do you respond to that when you hear it? I've even had EMTs tell me; we don't give people free EpiPens. Why are we giving them free Narcan? Gabis: The people that serve you in restaurants, the people that work on your car, the people who do your landscaping, those people are addicts, and I often say, maybe the first time was a choice, the second time may have been a choice, but after that the demon has possession of them and it's a very difficult demon to exorcise. We shouldn't give you Nicorette because you're smoking. We shouldn't help you stop. You eat too much. You have diabetes. Why should we treat your diabetes? You got lung cancer because you smoked. We shouldn't treat you. So, the logic that whenever you expand it, the logic doesn't hold to say let them die. They chose that. We're not letting anybody else die from diabetes or lung cancer or COPD. We're treating them as best we can. It is easy to become cynical. It is easy to become calloused to this because we're dealing with this on a daily basis. So, just as that child came out and said, yup, mum OD'd again, we're seeing it so often and so intently that we're also becoming calloused to it and cynical to it. Fault Lines: Why are efforts to help reduce addiction and overdose deaths not helping? Gabis: I would say that our efforts are helping. We're working so hard. We're losing sleep. Families are calling us at night saying, what do I do? I just found out that my son, daughter, niece, nephew, brother, sister is an addict. When you look at how many doses of Narcan have been given, but the death rate has remained somewhat level, we are making a difference. But we have to work on the treatment component. We have to work on the prevention and education component. We have to work on getting treatment into the criminal justice system. We have to make sure that there's access to good treatment. It is a multifaceted problem, which means that there are multifaceted solutions to it. And I'd like to say that for every addict who gets clean - and I'm making these numbers up, but it illustrates the point - there are 100 steps that you have to go through in a particular sequence, but your 100 steps are different than mine. Or if they're the same, the sequence is different. So, there's no one size fits all. We can't prosecute our way out of this. We can't arrest our way out of this. We can't necessarily treat our way out of this. So, all of these children that are in foster care from these families that have been disrupted, the children that have witnessed their parents do this; we've got to be ready in 10 or 15 years to provide safety nets for them. Fault Lines: If things don't change, if things keep going as they are, what's at stake here? Gabis: What's at stake is the loss of two or three generations. There is plenty good that occurs in Chillicothe. There are wonderful, kind, generous, loving people here. This is not who we are. This is not what should define us; but unfortunately, it does define us, and it's at risk of us losing hope in ourselves. I've been doing this for eight years, and I'm getting tired because we're fighting so hard and fighting so long and - and we see the absolute negative, evil impact that this epidemic has. It makes it hard to keep going.

The patients at the new clinic are as young as 15 and as old as 40 [Sean Gallup/Getty Images] Constantine, Algeria - "When talking about addiction, people usually think about tobacco, drugs or alcohol dependency," said Dr Hakima Boualem, head of the medical staff of the addiction treatment centre of Bachir Mentouri clinic in Constantine. "But, for some, the fight is with internet - especially the 'magic blue' of Facebook." Last May, addiction specialists and psychologists at the Bachir Mentouri clinic, which is 450km to the east of the capital Algiers, rolled out a rehab programme designed for compulsive users of technology, particularly social networks.This is the first clinic in Algeria - and in Africa - aiming to cure Internet fanatics. READ MORE: Facebook rehab Algeria has joined a growing list of countries to open rehab centres helping those who suffer from a web obsession. In South Korea, home of the world's most connected population, digital detox camps have already treated thousands of children. According to South Korea's Ministry of Family, 14 percent of South Korean teenagers are addicted to the internet. Unlike South Korea, Algeria has been much slower to embrace the internet, launching long-awaited 3G service only about three years ago. Algeria's internet penetration rate remains relatively low, standing at 32.8 percent in a country of 40 million people, according to this year's State of Broadband Report . Today, the North African country counts more than nine million Facebook users, according to Algerian digital marketing analysts. But this increasing use of the internet has come at a price. "Algeria is experiencing what developing countries have been facing for a few years: the flip side of the internet," Dr Raouf Bougouffa, director of the Bachir Mentouri clinic's rehab department, told Al Jazeera. "An increasing number of internet users are losing control." Algeria has joined a growing list of countries to open rehab centres helping those who suffer from a web obsession [Djamila Ould Khettab/Al Jazeera] Though there is not yet a formal definition of what an internet-related addiction entails, health experts at the clinic agree that internet overuse has emerged as a national issue. They share many symptoms with hardcore drug addicts. When not able to go online, web fanatics feel fidgety and can show aggressiveness or anxiety. Dr Sihem Hemadna, a psychologist at the Constantine rehab centre "Their addiction is real and sometimes troubling," siad Sihem Hemadna, a psychologist at the Constantine rehab centre. When Al Jazeera met her, she was ending a psychotherapy session with a 20-something man. He refused to be interviewed. "Don't bother to try to reach him, he won't talk. Addiction remains a bright-line taboo in Algeria," Hemadna told Al Jazeera. Since May, she has met about 100 patients who say they can spend the entire day online, from sunrise till sunset, getting into arguments on forums and social media - sometimes without taking a break to eat or even use the bathroom. As a consequence, their physical health declines. "Most of them suffer from back pain, red eyes and headaches," Hemadna explained. "Actually, they share many symptoms with hardcore drug addicts. When not able to go online, web fanatics feel fidgety and can show aggressiveness or anxiety." The patients at the clinic are as young as 15 and as old as 40. "It could be anyone. Like any addiction, web obsession affects all of us, mostly teenagers and young adults," Boualem said. "One teenager, who went into the clinic because of his drug abuse, found out about web obsession and asked for help, explaining that his family could not take their eyes off the screen, including his parents. They were no longer talking to each other, nor having dinner together. He said he could not stand this family's toxic life. His parents and three brothers agreed to enrol in our internet rehab programme four months ago," Dr Hemadna said.

The reception hall also features an anti-internet addiction painting, designed by a local artist who was treated at the clinic. "Nobody has spontaneously visited us to be cured of internet dependency, only because no one knows about digital addiction. It is a new thing in Algeria. That is why we distributed those images. Awareness campaigns should also be set," said Hemadna. "Our patients come to us firstly because they want to overcome a drug addiction. But the more we talk with them, the more we notice that they suffer from another addiction: Web obsession," she added. Heavy use of the internet is not necessarily pathological, experts say. "People can spend hours each day in front of a screen without being addicted. The critical distinction between an addiction and just a bad habit is that addiction implies a pattern of use that you cannot stop." For some users, going online is as important in their life as breathing, eating or sleeping. We are literally talking about people who put their life at risk," Djamel Berkat, an addiction specialist at Bachir Mentouri clinic, told Al Jazeera. 'The critical distinction between an addiction and just a bad habit is that addiction implies a pattern of use that you cannot stop,' says Hemadna [Djamila Ould Khettab/Al Jazeera] Last June, when the Algerian government decided to block social networks nationwide for a week in an attempt to stop people cheating on high school exams, some web addicts reached a crisis point. "We received dozens of patients who were very nervous because of the internet shutdown during the baccalaureate exams. Some said that they could not handle it, comparing the internet to oxygen," Hemadna recalled. The internet rehab programme is entirely paid for by the Algerian government. "At Bachir Mentouri, we consider internet addiction the same as other types of addiction," said Boualem."The cure starts with a full psychological evaluation. During the first session, we get to know the patient, while during the second meeting, we try to find the real reasons of their addiction. "Web obsession, like any other addiction, is only the tip of an iceberg. We often find underlying mental or psychological issues," Boualem added. The treatment package includes individual and group therapy, and relaxation and meditation training. "Physical exercises and music therapy help to wean them off their dependency," said Berkat, showing a room equipped with two treadmills and yoga balls. But going cold turkey is not easy in a country where there are few distractions but millions of unemployed young people. Nearly a quarter of the population under the age of 24 has no job, according to the National Office of Statistics. "Many Algerians spend whole nights at cyber cafes to connect on social networks because they do not have many places to hang out. The situation is worst outside Algiers," Berkat explains. "The internet offers them what they cannot find anywhere else in Algeria: A euphoric escape from reality. But they end up sucked into a digital world." It is too early to say whether the Bachir Mentouri treatment clinic can cure internet addicts [Djamila Ould Khettab/Al Jazeera] Sitting next to him, Boualem pointed out that parents may share some responsibility. "They often encourage their children to use technology, without being aware of the harm it could do to them." "One mother, who accompanied her son to the clinic and had no clue about internet addiction, said that she would rather keep her children at home, either connecting or gaming, than allow them to participate in outdoor activities because she thinks that it is much safer," Boualem said. It is too early to say whether the Bachir Mentouri treatment clinic can cure internet addicts. More studies needs to be done, experts say. "We are flying blind because we have done little research about this new ailment," Berkat said. Similarly, Bougouffa asserted: "We have seen the good and the bad side of the internet. It is now time to launch a national debate about internet use in Algeria." SOURCE: Al Jazeera Middle East Algeria Internet Addiction
Support for independence has risen dramatically in what is seen as an attempt to curb Catalan power [Reuters] Barcelona, Spain - Sleep has been hard to come by in Barcelona this week - but not on account of the city's fabled nightlife. Instead, the narrow streets and old squares of Barcelona have reverberated to a crepuscular cacophony of banging pots and pans. These noisy protests - called cacerolazo, literally "casserole" - started recently after Spain's constitutional court suspended a proposed non-binding poll on Catalan independence. A vote, however, will go ahead as planned on Sunday, Catalan President Artur Mas has said. In Barcelona, cacerolazo protesters have vowed to keep beating their kitchenware until it does.

The vote was initially intended as a legally binding referendum on independence from Spain, but was downgraded to a symbolic "consultation" after an intervention from the country's constitutional court . Now, it has been watered down further. Sunday's poll will be "a participatory process" with no formal standing, run entirely by volunteers instead of the Catalan government. Future of Catalonia Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has called any attempt to hold a vote on leaving Spain "anti-democratic", saying Spain's constitution prevents any region from unilaterally taking decisions that affect all Spaniards. Madrid and Barcelona have been at loggerheads since July 2010, when a new statute on Catalan autonomy was struck down by Spain's constitutional court. Support for independence has risen dramatically in the wake of what was widely seen as an attempt to curb the power of Catalan's regional parliament. Just under half of Catalans are in favour of leaving Spain, according to opinion polls last month. More than one-fifth of respondents said they were recent converts to the nationalist cause. Rocio Martinez-Sampere Rodrigo, a socialist parliamentarian at the Catalan assembly, is opposed to independence but says a referendum is needed to settle the future of Catalonia, a region of 7.5 million people that stretches for 400km from the French border to neighbouring Valencia. The Spanish constitution is quite clear on this point, the unity of Spain cannot be questioned. - Rafael Lopez, Catalan Popular Party MP PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Martinez-Sampere Rodrigo, who favours a federal arrangement for Catalonia, blames the Spanish prime minister for unwittingly building Catalan support for leaving Spain. "Rajoy has never approached this in a political way, he is just saying 'no, no, no' to everything," she told Al Jazeera. "If you say 'no' to everything, people will say the only solution is independence." But Rafael Lopez, a Catalan member of parliament from Rajoy's conservative Popular Party, said any referendum on independence would be illegal. "The Spanish constitution is quite clear on this point, the unity of Spain cannot be questioned," Lopez said. Sunday's poll will have "no legal validity nor democratic guarantee", Lopez added. Nevertheless, Catalan nationalists have been busy preparing for the vote. Television adverts and mailshots have carried election information. Pro-independence memes have ignited on social media. Widespread frustration An estimated 40,000 people have volunteered to staff polling centres across Catalonia. Expatriates in around 40 cities worldwide - including London, Paris, Mexico City, and Montreal - will be able to vote at offices of international Catalan delegations. The ballot will have the same two-part question that was planned for the suspended referendum. The first is whether voters want Catalonia to be a state. The second is whether they want it to be an independent state. As in the recent independence referendum in Scotland, 16 and 17-year olds will be able to participate, too. The clamour for Catalan independence has grown amid Spain's financial crisis and widespread frustration with the central government's reluctance to grant more powers to the Catalan parliament, which was re-established in 1980. Recent attempts by Madrid to interfere with Catalan education have further stoked passions. Catalonia is the country's most prosperous and most economically productive region and accounts for about a quarter of Spain's taxes - far more than its share of Spain's population. Catalonia's fiscal deficit - the difference between what it pays to Madrid and, after taking some funds to pay state costs, the money it gets back - runs at between 7 and 10 percent of the region's GDP. Such disparities have deepened resentment. 'V' for vote On September 11 this year, Catalonia's national holiday, hundreds of thousands of independence supporters converged on Barcelona, forming a huge "V" - for vote - in Catalan red and yellow. Now nationalists are hoping a large demonstration of strength on Sunday will show both Madrid and the world that their demands are not going away. "The goal is to keep the pressure on Madrid and to demonstrate to the world that the process is alive and it's not just an invention of Artur Mas," said Marc Vidal, foreign editor of pro-independence Catalan newspaper ARA . I think the fact that the Spanish government is making it so difficult to voice your opinion is making people angry, and making people determined to vote. - Liz Castro, s upporter of Catalan independence PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The vast majority are expected to vote "yes", but turnout will be crucial. Two million votes, about 30 percent of the electorate, would be a "big result" for the nationalists, said Vidal. Liz Castro, a supporter of Catalan independence in Barcelona, said the attitude of the Spanish government will only strengthen nationalists' resolve to turnout on Sunday. "I think the fact that the Spanish government is making it so difficult to voice your opinion is making people angry, and making people determined to vote," Castro said. Supporters of the union with Spain argued independence would be disastrous for Catalonia - and for Europe. "If regions like Catalonia, the Flemish region, Lombardy, Veneto, some German states or Corsica decide to secede, Europe would be cut into pieces, and that would go against its philosophy," said Josep Ramon Bosch, president of pro-union association Societat Civil Catalana. While there is little doubt about the outcome of Sunday's consultation, a long-term solution to the Catalan question is much less clear cut. Spain's national politics has been turned on its head following a poll this week that put Podemos, a youthful leftist-only party formed in January, ahead of both Rajoy's Popular Party and the main opposition Socialist Party nationally . Some Catalan commentators expect Artur Mas to call early elections to the Catalan parliament, in an effort to secure a resounding majority in favour of independence and increase pressure on Madrid. But Mas himself has been weakened by a tax-evasion scandal involving the founder of his ruling Convergence and Union party. A recent poll showed the more fervently pro-independence Republican Left of Catalonia well ahead among Catalan voters. For Catalan nationalists, however, the big question is how Madrid will react to the latest salvo in the campaign for a referendum on independence. "There is a general feeling that the Spanish government doesn't know what is going on here," said independence activist Castro. "I don't think they really realise what people are ready to do here."

Pro-independence citizens in Catalonia hold up giant letters reading 'We are ready Independence' [Reuters] Last September, Scotland narrowly elected to remain part of the United Kingdom in a historic referendum. Now Catalans will have the chance to register their support for leaving Spain after Catalan nationalists called snap regional elections to be held on September 27. On January 14, Catalonia's centrist President Artur Mas announced an agreement with his nationalist rivals, Esquerra Republicana (ERC), to run separate tickets but with a shared road map towards secession, making September's vote a de facto referendum on leaving Spain. "Our adversaries would have wanted us to remain divided," Mas, the leader of Convergència i Unió (CiU), the largest bloc in the Catalan Parliament but trailing in opinion polls, said in a recent televised address. "We managed to re-establish our unity." If the nationalists win a majority, Mas has said the government will push for independence. Mas' move brought an end to two months of squabbling between the rival pro-independence parties, which had threatened to derail the nationalist movement in Catalonia, a prosperous region of some 7.4 million people in northeast Spain. "The tensions between ERC and CiU were becoming worrying for pro-independence supporters that were starting to wonder if the whole process was about to collapse," says Laura Pous Trull, a journalist with the Catalan News Agency ACN. "Mas' agreement with ERC reignites the process when many were starting to become sceptical about it." Supporter relief In Barcelona, Catalan independence supporters welcomed the deal between Mas and his opposite number, Esquerra Republicana leader Oriol Junquera. "The most important thing is that not what was said but that they are in agreement," says independence activist Liz Castro. "People are relieved. People who are in favour of independence really want independence so having no agreement was really damaging. There was a lot of confusion, disorganisation and frustration." The frustration among Catalan nationalists stems, in part, from a perceived loss of momentum in the wake of November's illegal ballot on independence. Although 2.3 million people turned out to vote - and the overwhelming majority backed leaving Spain - the unofficial referendum brought secession no closer. Spain's conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has consistently refused to countenance any change to Catalonia's constitutional position. Nationalists now hope a majority for pro-independence parties in September's elections will presage negotiations on leaving Spain. "If ERC and CIU - maybe also with MPs from more radical left-wing CUP - get an overall majority, Catalans will have a mandate to negotiate independence from Spain. Every vote for them will be considered as a 'yes to independence' vote," says Pous Trull. Support for Catalan independence has risen dramatically in the recent years, fuelled by Spain's economic crisis and a 2010 Constitutional Court decision that struck down a statute of Catalan autonomy that had already been endorsed in a referendum. Since then millions have taken to the streets demanding a plebiscite on leaving Spain. There has been a general feeling of frustration in Catalonia, but if there was a hard referendum on independence a lot of people would fall away. - Michael Keating, Aberdeen University Auspicious month September is an auspicious month for Catalan nationalists. September 11, the date Barcelona fell to Bourbon forces in 1714, is Catalonia's national holiday. Last year on La Diada, hundreds of thousands of independence supporters converged on Barcelona, forming a huge "V" for vote in Catalan red and yellow. There are, however, indications the appetite for Catalan independence is waning. Opinion polls published by the Catalan government in December showed a majority in favour of remaining part of Spain for the first time in two years. "There has been a general feeling of frustration in Catalonia, but if there was a hard referendum on independence a lot of people would fall away," says Michael Keating, chair in Scottish politics at Aberdeen University and a researcher on sub-state nationalist movements in Europe. "Catalans haven't had the kind of full debate that took place in Scotland. There are still a lot of uncertainties about what independence means," Keating told Al Jazeera. Questions are being raised, too, over whether CiU and ERC, the dominant forces in the Catalan parliament since it was re-established in 1980, will be able to win a majority in September's elections. Mas' party has been weakened by a series of corruption scandals, while Podemos, the fledgling political party that has electrified Spanish politics, threatens to take votes from the pro-independence parties, particularly the republican left of ERC. "Until now the independence movement was the only movement in Catalonia, and even in Spain, talking about hope, change and transformation. Now Podemos are also using these words, so the pro-independence movement has competition for the first time in years," says Dani Cetra, a sociologist researching Catalan nationalism. Rise of the left Podemos, which was formed just a year ago by writer and television presenter Pablo Iglesias Turrió, is currently topping opinion polls in Spain. The party is cautiously against Catalan independence, but in favour of holding a vote. A measure of Podemos' growing importance in the Catalan debate came recently when renowned Catalan singer and independence supporter Lluis Llach said publicly, "The battle that Catalonia solves through the search for independence is the same as the one that Pablo Iglesia's party represents in Spain." Analysts warn the political landscape - in Catalonia and in Spain - could change dramatically between now and September's elections. The whole country goes to the polls in municipal elections in May, and a general election is due between November 2015 and January 2016. Catalan nationalists are expected to outline a road map for independence in the coming weeks. Joint plans to build alternative state structures are being developed. Nevertheless May's local elections could put a strain on the newfound unity between ERC and CiU. Even if independentistas do emerge with a majority in September, the road to Catalan statehood is hardly clear-cut. "We don't know what is going to happen," says Marc Vidal, foreign editor of pro-independence Catalan newspaper ARA . "Nobody is talking about declaring independence the day after the election, but we don't know what the outcome will be." One thing seems certain: come September, the eyes of all Europe's nationalist movements will be firmly on Catalonia.

Hundreds of thousands of pro-independence Catalans are expected to rally Friday to break away from Spain [Javier Pérez de la Cruz/Al Jazeera] Barcelona, Spain - A man standing on the balcony of the regional government ' s headquarters proclaims the Free Catalan Republic. It happened in 1931, but a hologram recreated the historic moment during this year ' s official celebration of Catalonia ' s national day. People gathered in Sant Jaume ' s square cheered and clapped as the people had done back then. After years of ambiguity, the current regional government seems to have finalised its U-turn towards independence. Now they face the upcoming regional election on September 27 as a referendum on whether Catalonia should break with Spain. The latest poll suggests that pro-independence parties will reach an absolute majority. This year ' s celebration of Catalonia ' s national day on Friday is special as it also marks the start of the two-week electoral campaign. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected by the pro-independence forces. Alba Porta, 27, a teacher, is planning to attend the march. " I do feel I ' m being used by them, but it ' s also an opportunity - we need the establishment to reach our goals, so in a way it ' s us who are using them, " Porta said. She will vote for the pro-independence Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), a far-left party. " From my point of view, independence and better social policies come together. Even with a central government led by Podemos, I think it is very hard to change Spanish politics - it is easier to do it in Catalonia. " The Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC), currently in power, has joined forces with the Republican Left of Catalonia party in a single-issue alliance called "Junts pel Si" - Together for a Yes Vote. Corruption scandals, however, are piling up against the ruling party of the Catalan president, Artur Mas. The last case took place only two weeks ago when police raided CDC headquarters looking for evidence into kickbacks allegedly paid by companies to the party. Despite corruption Despite all this, there is little doubt that Junts pel Si will win the election - by 38.8 percent, according to the poll published by the Catalan newspaper El Periodico. Begona Corbella will be one of the people voting for the party. " To me independence comes first, but we aren ' t being fooled. There ' s a lot of corruption everywhere and we know only a few families are always on top of the political parties. But I ' m voting Junts pel Si because I want independence and because I like the diverse team they have put together, " she told Al Jazeera. Corbella is a 46-year-old teacher in Barcelona. She thinks one of the reasons the independence movement has grown so fast is the " disrespectful " attitude of the central government in Madrid. RELATED: Catalans eye new independence 'referendum' Corbella expressed her scepticism of the reasons for the corruption probes. " I don ' t buy the whole corruption story," she said. "Of course, there are many cases, but this last one - it ' s not a coincidence that they started investigating so close to the regional election. " This attitude is similar to the official position of the party. " We are convinced some people are trying to win in court what they can ' t win in the polling stations, " General Coordinator Josep Rull of the CDC told Al Jazeera. " There ' s no corruption, it ' s just an investigation. CDC is willing to cooperate with justice [authorities], but we don ' t want to take part in this media circus, " Rull said. Not the first time This is not the first time CDC is linked to a corruption scandal. There were allegations of irregular funding, tax fraud, and a money laundering investigation into Jordi Pujol, CDC ' s founder and Catalonian premier for 23 years. " I think the leaders of CDC have thrown themselves over the idea of independence as a way out from the corruption scandals, " said 70-year-old Josep Lopez, who has always voted Convergence and Union (CiU), the former coalition, in which CDC was the major party. I also want the independence because I'm tired of paying taxes and seeing the benefits going somewhere else. Mari Carmen Quero, voter CDC's Rull finds the notion that the party aims to manipulate so many voters, "offensive". "We aren ' t going to retract [from independence]. We have tried many times to negotiate with Madrid and it has never worked. We want to agree with the central government the terms to create our own state. A Scotland-UK style referendum is our goal, " Rull said. Not all Catalans are pro-independence, and many feel lost amid the politics of a pro-independence push. " I don ' t know what I ' m going to vote this time because I don ' t want Catalonia to break away from Spain," Lopez said. "It would be very negative economically speaking. Many companies would move their headquarters away from here, " explained Lopez. "Before I was completely convinced I was going to vote for independence, but now I ' m scared they can take away the companies from Catalonia, " he said. RELATED: Podemos and the Catalan cause Mari Carmen Quero would like to see an independent Catalonia, although she was born in Spain ' s southern region of Andalusia. " Having lived and worked here for many years, I think Catalonia has a different culture and I feel part of it. I also want the independence because I ' m tired of paying taxes and seeing the benefits going somewhere else. "Here, there ' s also people struggling a lot, and we need better public education and health services, " said Quero.

Rajoy has fired Catalonia's regional government, including its leader, Carles Puigdemont. Speaking after a crisis cabinet meeting to decide Madrid's measures, Rajoy declared the dissolution of the Catalan parliament and called a snap election in the region on December 21. {articleGUID} Central government ministries will assume directly the powers of the Catalan administration until the regional poll takes place, he said. Spain's prosecutor's office, meanwhile, said it would file rebellion charges against Puigdemont. A court will have to decide to accept the charges. Under Spanish law, the crime of rebellion can be punished with up to 30 years in prison. Spain's Constitutional Court has also started a review of the Catalan parliament's vote. How will Spain impose direct rule? There are many obstacles in Madrid's way, given that Catalans are fiercely protective of the region's high degree of autonomy, such as direct control over education, healthcare and the police. Spain's government said it was not planning to make any arrests, but it is unclear how it will proceed if the current regional administration staff refuse to leave their offices. Mossos d'Esquadra, a group of Catalonia's police force favouring i ndependence, has already said its members will not follow instructions from the central government and will not use force to remove ministers and legislators from power. PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Rajoy said the Mossos chief would be fired. Rajoy chairs a cabinet meeting in Madrid on Friday [Diego Crespo/AFP/Getty Images] Mossos officers may be replaced by national police, who used heavy-handed tactics to thwart the referendum. Some fear this could lead to physical confrontations. Catalonia's secessionist groups have meanwhile called for widespread civil disobedience. The Catalan National Assembly called on civil servants not to follow orders from the Spanish government and urged them to follow "peaceful resistance". It is unclear whether such calls will be followed or not. Not all Catalans support breaking away from Spain, with polls showing they are roughly split. How will the crisis affect Catalonia's economy? Spain's economy ministry has already increased its control over regional finances and started paying directly for essential services. Under the new proposal, Madrid will take full financial control. Instability unleashed by the declaration of independence is sure to have economic consequences. Nearly 1,700 companies have recently moved their legal headquarters out of Catalonia, a region accounting for one-fifth of Spain's economic output. {articleGUID} Shares in Spanish companies, particularly Catalan banks, dropped sharply after the vote. The region attracts more foreign tourists than anywhere else in the country. What does the world think? Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, said the Catalan parliament's declaration of independence had changed nothing, adding that the EU will only deal with the central government in Madrid. "For EU nothing changes. Spain remains our only interlocutor," Tusk said on Twitter. For EU nothing changes. Spain remains our only interlocutor.

It is now official. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced on October 21 that his government would enact the controversial Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution to strip Catalonia of its autonomy. One week on, this previously little known constitutional clause is still the most discussed subject in every corner of the country. Refusing to engage in dialogue In his speech to the Catalan parliament on October 10, Catalan President Carles Puigdemont clearly articulated his desire to engage in constructive dialogue with the Spanish state. Yet, Rajoy responded with all the weight of the law, once again ignoring the will of a considerable section of the Catalan population. By refusing to engage in a conversation regarding the future of Catalonia, the Spanish president communicated to the Catalan population that the central government would neither listen to them nor allow a judicial solution to this grave political conflict. Madrid even took the provocative step of imprisoning the presidents of two major Catalan cultural institutions - Omnium Cultural and Catalan National Assembly. Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez were imprisoned without bail on October 16, pending a trial on charges of sedition in relation to their separatist organising efforts. Their imprisonment further deepened the fractures in the Spanish society. More than 200,000 people took to the streets in Barcelona, demanding the release of the two men they consider political prisoners. Cuixart and Sanchez are now seen as "martyrs of the cause" in Catalonia - two people jailed for their political beliefs, in the 21st century, in the middle of Europe. In light of last month's developments - the use of brute force on people that are trying to participate in a referendum, jailing of Cuixart and Sanchez and the decision to enact Article 155 - Madrid can no longer claim that the people of Catalonia are enjoying full democratic freedoms. Of course, their imprisonment was framed completely differently in Madrid. The central government, once again not afraid to use a language of confrontation, said the two men were rightfully jailed, as they were inciters of the "separatist order", an expression painfully reminiscent of the darkest chapter of 20th century Spain . The consequences of Article 155 So, the two sides of this political crisis cannot even agree on what has actually been happening before our eyes. And, they also have very different interpretations on the possible consequences of the enactment of Article 155. According to Madrid, enactment of this constitutional clause is not in any way an attack on Catalonia's hard-earned autonomy. They ignore the fact that this referendum was only the latest chapter in Catalonia's decades-long journey towards independence and, they claim, Article 155 will simply "fix" the problems caused by an "unlawful" referendum. They claim this move will only "restore the constitutional order in Catalonia". They say the people of Catalonia are not oppressed, and the people of Catalonia will not be oppressed even after the enactment of Article 155. Rajoy listed four goals for enacting Article 155: to return to legality, to recover normality and co-existence, to continue with economic recovery and to have an election in Catalonia in "normal political circumstances". Yet, by taking a brief look at what Article 155 will actually bring to Catalonia, we can easily see that Rajoy's claims do not have a leg to stand on. {articleGUID} After the enactment of Article 155, the Catalan regional government will be dissolved; in other words, the central government in Madrid will start governing Catalonia single-handedly. In six months, early regional elections will be forced. In addition, it seems that President Puigdemont - the democratically elected leader of the region - will have to face charges and may end up as his predecessor, Artur Mas - removed from political life and forced to pay thousands of euros in fines. The enactment of Article 155 will also allow the government of Spain to review all future parliamentary activity in Catalonia. This means that Catalonia's autonomy will be reduced to something symbolic, at best, as the regional parliament will lose the authority to pass any legislation without the central government's strict approval. In order to finish the destruction of Catalan self-government, the central government will also take control of the Catalan public media (TV3, Catalunya Radio). Catalan journalists working for these organisations have already demonstrated their total rejection of the measure, claiming that they will not abide. Of course, the government of Spain already resorted to a threat to solve this "small problem" of journalistic integrity: any public official - including journalists - who does not respect the constitutional measures will be removed from their role and punished by law. So in the end, a hard task awaits the Spanish government if it wants to prove to the world and the people of Catalonia that it is not attacking the autonomy and the dignity of the Catalan people. In light of last month's developments - the use of brute force on people that are trying to participate in a referendum, jailing of Cuixart and Sanchez and the decision to enact Article 155 - Madrid can no longer claim that the people of Catalonia are enjoying full democratic freedoms. At the end of this week, the Senate will approve the enactment of Article 155 and the Parliament of Catalonia will also meet to discuss the issue. {articleGUID} The Catalan government, now facing an existential threat, may see this as an opportunity to declare independence - as even Catalans who do not support independence view the enactment of Article 155 as an aggressive and unjust measure. Yet, I still believe that declaring independence, at this point in time, will not be the most sensible option, especially if the people of Catalonia really want one day to become a recognised independent state and a respected member of the international community. If the Catalan government declares independence in the coming days, Spain will not hesitate to apply the full weight of the law - and its security forces - to stop this from happening. Therefore, the only sensible option for the Catalan people is to insist on dialogue. Catalan leadership now needs to listen to the sound voices coming from other parts of Europe and work towards de-escalation and dialogue. This political conflict needs to be solved, and it needs to be solved without humiliation, so that future generations can enjoy peaceful coexistence in Europe . Madrid is making this harder for the Catalan leadership by refusing to listen to the will of the Catalan people. Prime Minister Rajoy, with the support of several powerful European leaders, seems to be on a quest to end the Catalan "conflict" by taking measures to destroy the cultural essence of the Catalan people - turning Catalonia in to a place that will one day be remembered as the historic homeland of the "extinct Catalan people". And the enactment of Article 155 is the first step in this path. He is continuing a strategy favoured by many Spanish leaders in the past: to absorb the Catalan identity into centralist and exclusive Spanish nationalism. As the former education minister of the Popular Party Jose Ignacio Wert said in 2012 , Madrid's "goal is to Spanishise Catalan students ". Now, the central government will have the opportunity to control the lives of the Catalan youth, make them "Spanish" and to eradicate any claim that may one day "break Spain" - a fear that the current Spanish political class tragically shares with the late dictator Franco. Today, Catalonia is once again between the sword and the wall, cornered and silenced. In 1971, during a speech to the United Nations , famous musician Pau Casals defined Catalonia as "a nation of peace". What will Catalonia be like in the future? The answer to that question will be determined by Madrid. The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial policy.

Mossos d'Esquadra officers (Catalan Regional Police) stand guard as Spanish Unionist protesters rally in front of Civil Guard headquarters in Barcelona, Spain [Albert Gea/Reuters] You can read the opposing view here . Catalonia is experiencing tense and uncertain times. In the last month, the regional government - made up of a coalition of nationalist parties called Junts pel Si (Together for yes) and supported in the regional parliament by an anti-establishment and Eurosceptic party (the Popular Unity Candidacy, CUP) - has decided to press ahead with its separatist project at all costs. Its ambition is not only in violation of the Spanish constitution and the Catalan autonomy statute, but does not even have the support of the majority of Catalans. The nationalists' razor-thin parliamentary majority in the Catalan Parliament does not mean that separatists have won the popular vote in the region. Rather, their majority is the result of an electoral law based on corrected proportional representation that benefits the least populated provinces (the vote of a citizen of the province of Lleida or Girona, for example , is worth double that of one in the province of Barcelona, by far the most populated province). However, the Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont , is prepared to secede on the basis of the most recent regional elections in 2015, in which separatist parties only won 47.8 percent of the vote, and an attempted referendum held on October 1, despite being suspended by the Constitutional Court, with no democratic guarantees, no existing law and no electoral authority to validate the results. It goes without saying that this pseudo-referendum also did not meet any of the main requirements set by the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe ( pdf ), which sets the standards for referendums taking place in Europe . With 37.8 percent of the electorate voting "yes" (only 42 percent of registered voters participated in the referendum and 90 percent of those voted "yes", according to the questionable results provided by the regional government itself ) on October 10, Puigdemont appeared before the Catalan Parliament and made an illusory proclamation of independence. However, he immediately suspended its effects, demanding that the Spanish government accept international mediation to find a solution to the "conflict" as though, instead of an internal matter that should be addressed within the framework of the Spanish constitution, it were a dispute between two sovereign states or a struggle as bitter as Colombia's with the FARC guerrillas . {articleGUID} The mere suggestion of international mediation is offensive because Catalonia is not a colony, but one of the most affluent regions of Spain , which enjoys the highest quality of life in the country and in Europe. It is also one of the regions that enjoys the greatest level of self-government in the world. The former prime minister of France , Manuel Valls, who is of Catalan descent, pointed this out recently. "Catalonia has regional powers unthinkable in France," Valls said . "There is genuine autonomy that is respected by Spain." For example, the only medium of instruction in schools in Catalonia is Catalan, whereas Spanish is taught for only two hours a week. As a result, Catalonia has the dubious honour of being the only place in the Western world where the majority of the population do not even have the option of enrolling their children in schools that teach in their native language, Spanish. This high level of self-government was apparent when the Catalan regional police (Mossos d'Esquadra) took charge of the investigation into the terrorist attack that took place in Barcelona on August 17. Valls adds that "the Spanish Constitution of 1978 is one of the most democratic in the world" and that "Catalans are not an oppressed people." His words may seem obvious to anyone somewhat familiar with the reality in Catalonia and Spain, but the Puigdemont government has launched a global campaign to discredit Spanish democracy and to convince the international community that Catalans are oppressed by an authoritarian state that systematically violates human rights . It makes no difference that according to The Economist's global Democracy Index, Spain is once again among the " full democracies ", above countries such as the United States , Italy, Japan, Belgium and France , among others. Constitutional order must be restored in Catalonia as soon as possible. This international operation runs parallel to another long-standing agitation and propaganda campaign carried out by the regional government for years on Catalan public radio and television, where it systematically stirs up confrontation with the rest of Spain and tries to convey the perverse idea that Spain is not a full democracy. The image of a presenter on public television (which all Catalans pay for with taxes) burning a copy the Spanish constitution live on air is the quintessence of the hate speech peddled with impunity by the Catalan public media. It is not that they have a pro-government bias, but that they make up news stories and hide the truth of the consequences of secession from the citizens of Catalonia. Some of them are now starting to see through Puigdemont's obfuscation, who intends to go all the way in his defiance of our democratic state and the rule of law. {articleGUID} More than 1000 companies (including the two biggest financial institutions in Catalonia, Sabadell and CaixaBank ) have in the last month moved their headquarters from Catalonia to other regions of Spain, despite the former Catalan President Artur Mas saying in 2015 that this would "never happen". They also insist that secession would not result in Catalonia leaving the European Union , even though the European Commission and the main heads of state and government of the EU have made this crystal clear. Despite the obvious rifts in their separatist project, the Catalan public media, like the orchestra on the Titanic, continue to play the music given to them by the populist regional government which, realising that it could not achieve a united Catalonia, has chosen to divide it rather than give up on its objective. Catalans do not deserve this irresponsibility. Constitutional order must be restored in Catalonia as soon as possible. To this end, the Spanish government, faced with Puigdemont's repeated refusal to return to the path of democratic legality, has decided to invoke Article 155 of the 1978 Constitution. This is a provision (present in the constitutions of other countries such as Germany , Austria and Italy) by which the government orders an autonomous community to comply with the Constitution and the law, and allows it to take the "necessary measures" to this end. Yet, it needs to be noted that with the application of the Article 155, Catalonia's autonomy is not suspended, as some people say. On the contrary, those who are putting at risk Catalonia's autonomy are the separatists placing themselves outside the law. With the invocation of the Article 155, precisely, this autonomy the separatists have damaged with their decisions and actions against the Constitution and the statue of autonomy of Catalonia is being recovered.

Clay 'caganers' wearing Catalan separatist flags and Scottish flags are sold at the Santa Llucia Christmas market in central Barcelona [Reuters] Since the Catalan government's decision to stage a referendum on independence on October 1, there has been much comment on the rise of separatist movements across Europe. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warned that the EU could not accommodate 95 member states. Alarm has been expressed about the contagion effect of Catalonia on other stateless nations striving to establish their own state. There is, in fact, no wave of separatism across Europe. In Belgium, the Flemish nationalist party is part of the national government but has not even insisted on a constitutional reform. It talks about confederalism; independence is, at most, a long-term and rather vague aspiration. The Italian Lega Nord abandoned separatism years ago and now appeals as an Italian nationalist and Eurosceptic party, seeking votes in the south as well as the north. The recent referendums in Lombardy and Veneto were for more regional devolution, not separation. There is not majority support in Northern Ireland for leaving the United Kingdom, even among Catholics.The Basque Nationalist Party has moved away from its previous sovereigntist position and instead is looking for constitutional reform within Spain. The only separatist forces in France are in Corsica and, while the nationalists have advanced electorally, independence is not a serious proposition. {articleGUID} Within the European Union, there are precisely two independence-seeking movements of any significance, in Catalonia and in Scotland. In both cases, support for independence is around 40-45 percent. Both are governed by nationalist parties, which have sought to test support in independence referendums. In both cases, the independence movement has used membership of the European Union as something that would facilitate independence, although European institutions have given them no encouragement. At present, however, it is the difference between the two cases that most strikes the observer. Scotland's referendum in 2014 was facilitated by the British government, which decided that this was the best way to defuse a politically explosive situation. It helped that the United Kingdom has a very flexible constitution so that there was no legal obstacle. The key factor, however, was political. The UK has long been recognised as a voluntary union of nations and successive governments in recent years have recognised that they cannot be kept in the union against their will. This contrasts sharply with their attitude to Ireland and hundred years ago. The Scottish referendum was won by the anti-independence forces, who gained 55 percent of the vote. While the nationalists were defeated, however, they had demonstrated that they are a considerable force in Scottish society. Neither side had scored a knock-out victory. So, after the referendum, the two sides engaged in a negotiation to produce a compromise of further autonomy for Scotland. Since referendum of 2014, we have had the referendum on Brexit. While the UK as a whole voted to leave the European Union, Scotland voted, by a larger margin, to remain. The Scottish government has argued that this justifies another independence referendum but it has recognised that permission for this will have to be obtained from the UK Parliament. There will be no legally dubious referendum and no unilateral declaration of independence. Catalonia has gone into a confrontation that could have been avoided some years ago with a bit of statesmanship. The contrast with Spain is striking. The Spanish constitution insists on the indivisibility of the Spanish people, a provision that has been interpreted very narrowly by Spanish political parties and the constitutional court. A reformed statute of autonomy was adopted in 2006 with the agreement of both Spanish and Catalan parliaments and a referendum in Catalonia. It was taken to the constitutional court by intransigent Spanish nationalists and key provisions were stuck down. From that point, support for independence grew. Catalonia has gone into a confrontation that could have been avoided some years ago with a bit of statesmanship. With some recognition of Catalonia's national status, stronger guarantees for its competences and language and a deal on taxation and spending, the great majority of Catalans would have been content to remain in Spain and Spain itself would have been strengthened. Instead, there has been a series of miscalculations on both sides and a failure to think through the consequences of their actions. {articleGUID} The search for compromise has been hindered by the fact that both the Spanish and the Catalan governments are weak. Neither has a parliamentary majority and both are beholden to their own hard-line nationalists. The Spanish Popular Party and the Catalan PDeCAT (formerly Convergencia) have been deeply tainted by corruption scandals. Since the contested referendum on October 1, both sides have raised the stakes. The Spanish government has invoked Article 155 of the constitution, allowing it to assume direct control of the Catalan administration. The Catalan Parliament has declared independence. The last opportunity for compromise, in which both acts could have been suspended and new elections called, was refused by Madrid, which opted for invoking Article 155 and calling Catalan elections as well. Yet even now there are deep similarities between the cases of Catalonia and Scotland, and indeed other processes across Europe. During the Scottish referendum campaign, there was a steady move of voters from the No and undecideds to the Yes camp, which did better than anyone had expected at the outset. Yet underlying attitudes had changed much less. When surveys offered a choice between the status quo, independence or more autonomy, support for more autonomy regularly came out on top. Many of the people who voted for independence, in fact, saw it as the best way of getting to that middle ground. Similarly, in Catalonia, there is an underlying support for due process and for moderation. A poll in September showed over 80 percent of Catalans in favour of having a legally-sanctioned referendum on independence. The same proportion thought that the actions of the Spanish government had encouraged pro-independence forces. A clear majority favoured proceeding gradually towards more autonomy, as the current Basque government is doing. A poll taken after the referendum showed 44 percent in favour of independence (where it has been for the last few years) but, when Catalans are offered the alternative of more autonomy, support for independence falls to 29 percent. What is happening in Europe is less an outbreak of separatism than a questioning of the model of the unitary nation-state. The government, the economy, societies and identities are rescaling at multiple levels. Sovereignty is, whatever the Spanish constitution proclaims, shared at multiple levels. Self-determination is about negotiating one's place in the new multilevel order. It is this, rather than the search for an illusory sovereignty, that the processes across Europe have in common. Catalonia and Scotland are test beds for this new understanding of politics and policy. There is no clear end to these processes, whether by reconstituting the old nation-state or breaking it up into new and smaller nation-states. In recognising this, people are often in advance of their politicians who, the more they lose the substance of sovereignty, the more they argue over its trappings.

Pro-unity demonstrators with banners calling for the imprisonment of Catalan President Carles Puigdemont, gather in Madrid, Spain [Susana Vera/Reuters] In a way, what happened yesterday at the Catalan Parliament was the second act of a drama that started during the session on the eve of 6-7 September , when the so-called "disconnection laws" - one law allowing for the referendum and another on the "Legal Transition" (with the elements of an independent Catalan Republic) - were passed . Then, the pro-independence bloc, which enjoys a wafer-thin majority (short of the two-thirds required to amend the Statute of Autonomy), passed these laws riding roughshod over Catalonia's parliamentary rules, its own Statute and the rights of opposition MPs, in a grotesque late-night plenary, against the warnings of the lawyers of the Catalan Parliament and ignoring the Council of Statutory Guarantees (binding under Catalan law). The anti-independence opposition bloc left the session in protest and did not vote. The disconnection laws and the referendum were declared null and void by the Spanish Constitutional Court. This is pretty much what happened yesterday. The secessionist bloc, again on the basis of their parallel legislation and a very disputed referendum on October 1st, tabled a resolution to proclaim the "Catalan Republic", thus moving forward with a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI). Most of the opposition parties, led by Ciudadanos (non-nationalist liberals, second political bloc in Catalonia), boycotted the session and left the chamber - together with its lawyers, who warned that the resolution violated both the Statute of Autonomy and the Spanish constitution and could trigger legal responsibility. The 11 members of Catalunya Sí Que Es Pot (leftists, mostly against independence, especially a UDI) stayed, with 10 voting "no" and one blank vote. {articleGUID} In the end, the resolution garnered support of 70 MPs out of 135. That is roughly around 35 percent of the census and provides a good measure of actual support for independence in Catalonia , with recent polls showing very limited support for UDI - especially when the option of more home rule is on the table. What happens now: Article 155 and judicial response Right at the same time, the Senate approved the implementation of Artice 155 of the 1978 Constitution, based on the federal coercion principle and similar to Article 37 of the German constitution upon which it is based and other constitutions. Contrary to widespread assumptions, the measures requested by Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy do not amount to a full suspension of autonomy, which would eliminate the Generalitat (the Catalan executive body, restored prior to the entry into force of the 1978 Constitution) and the Catalan Parliament. The 2006 Statute of Autonomy remains in force, with the powers and competences contained therein. The measures approved do nonetheless severely restrict the autonomy at the highest political level, chiefly with the dismissal of the entire Catalan government of President Carles Puigdemont, of the head of the Catalan Police (defendant in a judiciary process on his actions on October 1st), as well as of the Catalan government's foreign delegations (with the exception of Brussels) and its PR body, "Diplocat", widely perceived to be engaged in a very effective pro-independence (and anti-Spanish) lobbying campaign abroad. The powers of the Catalan government are now temporarily assumed by the authorities in Madrid. This process has done much to both impoverish and divide Catalonia, as shown by a semi-empty Catalan Parliament voting UDI, but little to further its legitimate self-government claims. Nonetheless, the actual roadmap approved by the Senate is a somewhat watered down version of the proposal submitted by the Council of Ministers, after an amendment of PSOE (Socialists, first opposition party). This amendment took out an initial proposal to take control over the main Catalan TV channel, TV3, also perceived as having become a propaganda outlet. As a result of close negotiations between Rajoy's government, keen on amplifying political support for Article 155, and PSOE, these steps now enjoy the legitimacy provided by two-thirds of the Spanish Parliament. They are nonetheless opposed by Podemos (leftists, somewhat caught wrong-footed given their opposition to both Article 155 and the UDI), and the nationalist parties. In turn, as a result of this UDI, Artice 155 enjoys support in Catalonia from Ciudadanos, Rajoy's PP (a small force, though) and the main leaders of PSC, Catalan Socialists. {articleGUID} In parallel but distinct to Article 155, the judicial response to some of the actions by Puigdemont and other core leaders goes on. The Spanish Prosecutor could file charges against Puigdemont - in theory, and until yesterday, the highest representative of the Spanish state in Catalonia- on grounds of provisions applicable to coup d'etats and rebellions. It goes without saying, these measures will probably lead to different measures of resistance by secessionist leaders and their mobilised constituencies, concentrated around the platforms of Catalan National Assembly (ANC), Omnium Cultural as well as CUP, an anti-system party against any negotiated settlement. This is coupled with the fact that many Catalans, though opposed to independence and UDI, also reject what they perceive an abridging of their self-government. In turn, the presence of the Spanish state in Catalonia, an essentially self-ruled region, is very limited, complicating the equation. Authorities in Madrid are eager to avoid violence and thus mainly focus on law enforcement through police forces. But some level of violence and pockets of resistance, hopefully peaceful, cannot be ruled out. Symbolic images of martyrdom that are surely to further incense secessionists and their narrative on Spanish oppression. Elections: stalemate or beginning of new political settlement? Rajoy, a nimble, old guard politician, is mindful of the stakes. This is why, right at the same time he announced the dismissal of Puigdemont and the entire Catalan government and also under 155, he announced early elections in Catalonia for December 21, earlier than anticipated, which should also mark the beginning of the end of Article 155 phase and the return to order and rule of law in Catalonia. This move is seen as shrewd, if risky, aimed to hollow out the secessionist narrative, with pro-independence parties now faced with the dilemma on whether to boycott "elections by Madrid", but in accordance with Catalonia's own laws, or take part. {articleGUID} It is unclear what will happen. Some polls show that parliamentary forces of pro-independence and non-secessionists could roughly remain even, a tad up, a tad down - though minor changes could be a game-changer for any majority in Catalonia, given the fragmented political space. The call for elections enjoys majority support in Catalonia and could provide an opening for returning to political normalisation, including progress towards constitutional reform in the mid-term - a process Rajoy agreed to with PSOE a few weeks ago, including more home rule in Catalonia. The main Catalan newspaper , La Vanguardia, welcomed the move, noting that "on this occasion, it cannot be denied to Rajoy, so often prone to slow motion, a fundamental virtue: the speed with which he seeks to protect, through electoral means, the rights of all Catalans, half of which have been abridged, in an unacceptable and repeated manner, by the government of Puigdemont". Long live the Catalan Republic? Time will tell whether this Catalan Republic proclaimed yesterday, not recognised by a majority of Catalans or any relevant actor, will survive 2017. Some argue that this is the end of the secessionist process' leap forward. It is evident that in their naked assertion of plebiscite majoritarianism over pluralistic democracy; in their contempt of other Catalans' preferences; in a post-truth that spins "Spanish oppression", asserted by an elite firmly in control of power in Catalonia for nearly un-interrupted 40 years, that denies the dramatic capital flight, this process has done much to both impoverish and divide Catalonia, as shown by a semi-empty Catalan Parliament voting UDI, but little to further its legitimate self-government claims.

RenderPagesVideo('5594247006001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Standing inside the grand hall of the Palau de la Generalitat, the Catalan regional government's headquarters in the Spanish city of Barcelona, in early 2016, a 54-year-old bespectacled former journalist addressed a crowd of politicians and citizens. Carles Puigdemont had just been inaugurated the Catalan president. Hanging around his neck was the gold medal of the government to symbolise his role as the 130th leader of the region. With pro-independence flags fluttering inside and outside the hall, he declared, "We have come from far, but we are not tired. We are full of hope." "Impossible is just an opinion." Catalonia referendum: Latest updates As two senior Spanish government officials from Madrid looked on, Puigdemont sounded defiant, vowing to consolidate support among the Catalans in his uphill effort to establish an independent republic. "We are pretty confident about the future of Catalonia within the European Union. It is a yes-yes situation," he said in an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera's John Hendren recently. On October 1, 2017, millions of Catalans voted in a referendum, with the large majority of voters supporting independence. That same day, violence unfolded as the government in Madrid tried to stop the vote from happening. In the weeks following the referendum, Puigdemont inched closer to his goal for his homeland, becoming the unlikely leader of a movement that started in a tiny town in the Catalan province of Girona. Almost four weeks after the referendum, Catalonia officially declared independence , with the Spanish government in Madrid immediately triggering Article 155, which allows the national government to take direct control of Catalonia . A day later, the Spanish government dismissed Puigdemont and cabinet, calling for new regional elections on December 21. Puigdemont and a handful of other Catalan ministers then left Barcelona for Belgium, where they remain. Spain has issued an international arrest warrant for the Catalan leaders. Puigdemont was the driving force behind Catalonia declaring independence on October 27. But who is the now sacked Catalan leader? Catalonia referendum: Who are the Catalans? He was born on December 29, 1962, in the Catalan region. At 16, he started working as a reporter for the local newspaper Diari de Girona. At the University of Girona, Puigdemont studied Catalan philosophy. But he dropped out of university to become a full-time journalist. After working for years for the now-defunct newspaper El Punt, he became its editor-in-chief in 1988. He wrote for the journal, Presencia and also founded the English-language magazine, Catalonia Today. In 2006, Puigdemont left journalism to join a Catalan electoral alliance, which later turned into a pro-independence movement. Because of his background in communication, he also helped establish the Catalan News Agency, a "digital native" mouthpiece for the Catalan movement. In 2011, he was elected mayor of Girona, the capital of the province of the same name. He was the first politician in 32 years to break the Socialist Party of Catalonia's dominance in the city.

On January 10, 2016, he was elected president of Catalonia. He is the first Catalan president to not declare an oath of loyalty to the Spanish constitution and the current king, Felipe VI. Amid criticism from the central government in Madrid for his role in the referendum, Puigdemont managed to push for the vote in the Catalan parliament. The voting was declared unconstitutional by the country's courts. However, Puigdemont and his supporters were defiant as he pushed for the region's second referendum on independence in three years. Of those that cast their ballots, a majority voted in favour of independence, leading to a political crisis in Spain . On October 27, Catalonia's future once again caused turmoil after the region declared independence from Spain. Several hours after the declaration, Puigdemont was fired and his regional government dissolved. The future of Puigdemont and the Catalan independence project is now uncertain. If Catalonia indeed becomes completely independent from Spain, Puigdemont, the college dropout who became the Catalan regional's president, is well-positioned to lead his people.

Catalonia is one of 17 autonomous regions that form Spain [Jack Taylor/Getty Images] Barcelona, Spain - Leaders of Spain's autonomous regions with minority populations have spoken out on Article 155. The Iberian state has 17 autonomous regions and four ethnolinguistic groups, including what is internationally known as Spanish. Some of these communities have entertained their own separatist goals. Ximo Puig, president of the Valencian Community, a region to the south of Catalonia that shares its history and language with the breakaway region, said on Saturday that he was glad to hear elections would be held. {articleGUID} Puig, a politician from the regional branch of the Spanish Socialist Party, told reporters that he would have been happy to see Catalan President Carles Puigdemont call elections, rather than the Spanish government which made the call. But the Catalan president "did not dare to take this step" amid "circumstances and external pressures", Puig said. Puig has previously said that "no one is in favour of the use of Article 155 ". The article allows the Spanish government to impose direct rule over Catalonia. The Basque Nationalist Party (PNV by its Spanish acronym) said on Sunday that the Spanish government was "going deeper in error" with the application of Article 155. "The removal of legitimate Catalan institutions freely and sovereignly elected by citizens, far from being a solution, persists and deepens the error with which the central powers of the State have addressed the Catalan question," Andoni Ortuzar, president of the PNV, said in a statement. The PNV has little representation in Spanish legislature, but it could be crucial for Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. {articleGUID} Rajoy leads a minority government that was formed in October 2016 after a 10-month political deadlock, wherein no party could form a government. The Spanish Socialist Party finally opted not to vote against Rajoy's premiership, allowing the minority government to form. Rajoy needs the support of the PNV to pass a 2018 budget. Without it, new elections could be called. "Catalonia and [the Basque Country] are two nations, each with its own path, but united by the same desires for freedom and democracy," Ortuzar said.

Estelada is the one-starred Catalan flag used to represent an independent Catalan republic [Yves Herman/Reuters] Catalonia has dominated international headlines in recent weeks in the wake of a banned referendum on splitting away from Spain. Yet, the region in the northeast of Spain , which has its own language and distinct customs, has a long history of striving for independence. One of Spain's wealthiest region, Catalonia today accounts for 15 percent of Spain's population and 20 percent of its economic output. Historical disputes and financial grievances have strengthened the cause of independence, yet its 7.5 million people appear to be deeply divided over the issue. A defined region of Catalonia was first referenced in the 12th century. The region has been part of Spain since its unification in the 15th century, following the marriage of Ferdinand I of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile. Despite always simmering under the surface, Catalonia's independent spirit did not show up in a prominent way until the 17th century, when the Catalans revolted against the taxation imposed by Philip IV of Spain. In the decades that followed, Catalonia backed the eventual loser in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714), Archduke Archduke Charles of Austria. When Philip V won the war, the Catalans were zeroed out and their semi-independence and separate parliament were suppressed by the new king. In the early 19th century, the Catalan feeling of independence emerged again, leading to a revived effort for political autonomy. In 1931, Spain's form of government changed from a monarchy to a republic. Catalonia became semi-autonomous and the national Catalan government, the Generalitat, was reinstated. However, during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) the Catalans fought for the losing Republican side. After the war ended, General Francisco Franco and his Nationalist movement suppressed any form of Catalan identity - the Catalan language, customs and autonomy were all repressed until Franco's death in 1975. The new Spanish government granted Catalonia partial autonomy in 1977. Two years later, in 1979, the region was given full autonomy. {articleGUID} In 2006, a reformed version of 1979's statute of autonomy came into force. The new version gave the Catalan regional government more power, specifically on tax and finance matters. However, in 2010, Spain's constitutional court struck down the statute's reformed version, leading to a resurgence in Catalan nationalism. The court's ruling took place during the height of a major eurozone economic crisis, which had hit Spain particularly hard. As an economic heavyweight for Spain, Catalonia's calls for independence grew louder compared with the previous decades. With Barcelona, a major tourist destination, as its capital and popular beach resorts on its coastlines, Catalonia accounts for about a fifth of Spain's total GDP. In the following years, just as the Spanish economy recovered slowly, the Catalan nationalist movement kept gaining momentum. This paved the way in 2013 to a declaration of sovereignty, which was a precursor for a non-binding, highly contested referendum on independence in 2014 . {articleGUID} Although Spanish authorities fought the referendum in court, pro-independence campaigners staged a symbolic ballot, organised by volunteers rather than government officials to get around court restrictions. Some two million people voted in favour of secession in that non-binding ballot, though turnaround was relatively low. In the end, more than 80 percent of those who cast their ballots backed a split from Madrid, leading to snap elections in Catalonia. In late 2015, the new Catalan government, encouraged by the election result, approved a measure for "peaceful disconnection from the Spanish state", a decision that was again contested by Madrid. The Constitutional Court in Madrid ruled that Catalonia's move was illegal. In March 2017, former Catalan leader Artur Mas was barred from public office for two years by a court in Madrid for his prominent role in the 2014 referendum . {articleGUID} But it was that vote that eventually led to the new referendum on splitting from Spain on October 1, 2017. Spanish police interfered, using force to try to stop Catalans from voting. The Catalan regional government said 90 percent voted for independence, but turnout was less than 50 percent. After weeks of increasing political uncertainty, the Catalan regional parliament on October 27 unilaterally declared independence from Spain after a secret vote. This move angered Madrid, leading Spanish authorities to trigger Article 155 of the 1978 Constitution and assume direct control of the northeastern region. Catalonia's leaders were sacked and a snap regional poll was announced for December 21. SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Spain Catalonia Europe

Catalan police officers were ordered to escort ex-counsellors while they collect their belongings [Yves Herman/Reuters] Barcelona, Spain - The Spanish government has given dismissed ministers and officials of the regional Catalan government "a few hours" to take their possessions from their former offices. Madrid is assuming control over Catalan institutions on Monday after dismissing the regional government on Friday, hours after the Catalan parliament voted for secession . However, the Catalan government intends to go to work. "We want to recover normality with the utmost discretion and with the principle of minimum intervention," Juan Ignacio Zoido, Spain's interior minister and a member of the right-wing People's Party (PP), said on Monday. Mossos d'Esquadra, the Catalan police force, informed ministry workers that they were ordered to escort ex-counsellors who intended to collect their things. If the ex-counsellors do not leave their posts, the Mossos are to issue a statement to the authorities which would, presumably, lead to charges of "usurpation of functions". Spanish law says a person is committing a crime if they undertake the role of a public official without title or legitimate cause. The charge carries a punishment of one to three years in prison. {articleGUID} Catalan media reports that the Mossos first informed Josep Rull, a functionary of the Department of Environment and Sustainability, about the charge after he arrived at his ministry at around 10:00am local time. The deposed Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont had yet to arrive at the government palace in Barcelona's Gothic quarter on Monday morning. Puigdemont's Democratic Party of Catalonia is holding a meeting and the dismissed president is expected to be there. Former Vice-President Oriol Junqueras has not been seen at the Ministry of Economy, which he headed before his dismissal. A functionary of the Ministry of Economy, who asked his name not be used, confirmed to Al Jazeera Junqueras had yet to arrive and that the ministry has been dismissed without severance pay. While the Spanish government has dismissed ministers and high-ranking officials, it does not have the power to dismiss the Catalan parliament. Instead, regional elections have been called for December 21. Activists have gathered outside ministries to protect the former functionaries. No clashes between police and demonstrators have been reported. {articleGUID} The Mossos have become a symbol for many in Catalonia, due to their perceived resistance to orders from Madrid and their refusal to commit violence on October 1, the day of the disputed independence referendum. It remains to be seen how demonstrators will respond to the Catalan police force's consent to orders from Madrid. The former head of the Mossos, Josep Lluis Trapero, was dismissed over the weekend. He reminded his subordinates of their duty to respect their superiors. SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Europe Spain Catalonia

Moreover, he argues, "at this moment, there are no reasons to believe that any European Union member-state, or any other state for that matter, will ever recognise Catalonia [as an independent nation-state]," a prerequisite for Catalan secession to succeed in the long run.

RenderPagesVideo('5628166949001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Catalonia's deposed president has called on Catalans to oppose peacefully Spain's takeover of the semi-autonomous region. In a speech on Saturday from his home city of Girona, Carles Puigdemont said he would continue to work on what he called "a free country". "The best way to defend what we have conquered so far is to have a democratic opposition to Article 155," he said, referring to the law that allowed the government in Madrid to impose direct rule on the region. Puidgemont's address came a day after Mariano Rajoy , Spain's prime minister, dismissed Catalonia's regional government, including Puigdemont, dissolved its regional parliament and set a snap election for December. The unprecedented measures were taken in response to the Catalan parliament voting in favour of splitting from Madrid and establishing an independent republic. Leaders from Europe and elsewhere have largely stood behind Spain's central government. 'Premeditated aggression' In a televised statement, flanked by a Catalan and the EU flag, Puigdemont accused Madrid of "premeditated aggression" and said Catalonia would persevere "without violence, without insults, in an inclusive way". Only the regional parliament could elect or dismiss the regional government, he insisted. Thousands of Spaniards rallied in Madrid calling for national unity as Puigdemont spoke on Saturday. The crisis began when Catalans voted to secede from Spain in an October 1 referendum that was declared illegal by Spanish authorities. {articleGUID} Al Jazeera's Andrew Simmons, reporting from Barcelona, said it was evident from Puigdemont's address that he and his cabinet intended to stay in office. The Catalan public, divided on the issue of secession, "are confused and not quite sure what will happen next". Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, Spain's deputy prime minister, who has been put in charge of Catalonia , has announced that she will appoint a "series of delegates" to administer the region until elections take place, our correspondent said. "As for the interior ministry, appointments are being made and sackings are taking place, particularly in the police force," he said, noting that Josep Lluis Trapero, the head of the Mossos d'Esquadra, has been dismissed from his position. "The police force, a 17,000-strong body, are now all under orders to be professionally neutral and could be ordered to intervene during unrest. "Expect to see more peaceful demonstrations. Many have been planned for Sunday across the country, by both separatists and unionists, and expect to see more moves to take over the powers of this region by Madrid." Rajoy has said that Catalonia's declaration of independence is unlawful. The Spanish Constitutional Court is reviewing the regional parliament's decision and the prosecutor's office said it will file rebellion charges against Puigdemont, an offence that under Spanish law carries up to 30 years in prison.

Spain's Attorney General Jose Manuel Maza said the charges will include sedition and rebellion [Susana Vera/Reuters] Barcelona, Spain - Spanish Attorney General Jose Manuel Maza has confirmed he will file criminal complaints against the dismissed Catalan government. Maza said the charges will include sedition and rebellion, both felony offences with penalties of between one and 30 years in prison. The attorney general said the charges will be filed against dismissed Catalan President Carles Puigdemont , Vice-President Oriol Junqueras and others who "have produced an institutional crisis that ended the unilateral declaration of independence with total disregard of our Constitution last October 27". The complaint consists of 118 pages and asks that the accused be summoned as a precautionary measure, "taking into account the seriousness of the facts and of the crimes imputed." Later on Monday, Catalan daily La Vanguardia reported that Puigdemont had travelled to Belgium. The report came a day after Theo Francken, Belgium's migration minister, told local media that it would be "not unrealistic" for his country to offer Puigdemont political asylum if he asked for it. Political crisis The Catalan parliament voted to declare independence on Friday after an extended period of proposed negotiations between Madrid and Barcelona.

Carles Puigdemont left Spain after Madrid fired him and his government last Saturday [Jordi Bedmar/Generalitat de Catalunya/AFP] Barcelona, Spain - A Spanish judge has issued an international arrest warrant for dismissed Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont . Puigdemont has been in Belgium since Spanish authorities fired him and his cabinet on Saturday after the regional parliament declared independence . Judge Carmen Lamela issued the order on the grounds that it was public knowledge that Puigdemont is in Belgium. The warrant added two charges: prevarication (lying) and disobedience. It also names the four other ex ministers who accompany Puigdemont in Brussels. Puigdemont told Belgian state TV, RTBF, earlier on Friday that he "did not flee" Spain, but he travelled to Brussels to avoid violence. "Violence has never been an option for us," he said. {articleGUID} He added that "it is impossible to prepare [a defence]" while in Spain. Puigdemont will now face possible extradition from Belgium. The Belgian attorney general told Spanish news agency, Efe, earlier this week that if his office receives a warrant for Puigdemont, the "law will be applied". "If we receive [the warrant], we won't be able to make more comments or conjectures," he said. Speaking to Dutch media outlet, Puigdemont's lawyer Paul Bekaret said that warrant "will take a while, because [it] has to be translated, and then processed by the federal police". Nine ministers jailed The warrant comes after nine Catalan government officials, including dismissed Vice President Oriol Junqueras, were jailed without bail in Madrid on Thursday on charges of sedition, rebellion, and misuse of funds.

Puigdemont was wanted by Madrid on charges of lying and disobedience [File: Anadolu] Sacked by Spanish authorities, ex-Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has turned himself in to Belgian police after an EU-wide arrest warrant was issued. Four other cabinet members also turned themselves in at 9.17am local time on Sunday, according to the Belgian prosecutor's office. The five are due to appear in court later in the day when an investigative judge will decide whether to detain or release them. The arrest warrant , which Puigdemont is expected to contest, was issued on Friday. He was wanted by Madrid for "lying" and "disobedience". Al Jazeera's David Chater, reporting from the Brussels prosecutor's office, said: "[ Puigdemont] was saying all along he was going to cooperate with the judicial authorities here. He is now in the hands of police having surrendered himself. "If [the five] give good grounds for resisting those arrest warrants, the case will go to another court ... This process could, under special circumstances, take up to 90 days." {articleGUID} Puigdemont earlier told Belgian media he did not flee Spain, but travelled to Brussels to avoid violence. "Violence has never been an option for us," he had said. Catalonia has been in political upheaval since October 1, when the region held a disputed referendum on independence from Spain. Poll calls secessionist bid into question Sunday's developments came as a poll showed Catalan separatist parties might fall short of an absolute majority in the December 21 regional elections, calling into question the political future of the secessionist bid. {articleGUID} Spain called the vote following the dissolution of the Catalan government for its independence declaration. Pro-secession parties would win roughly 46 percent of the vote, according to Madrid-based pollster GAD3. This would mean a loss of 1.8 percent since the last regional elections in 2015. The poll was published on Sunday in La Vanguardia, a Catalan daily. Secessionist parties would win between 66 and 69 seats in the Catalan parliament. An absolute majority would require 68 seats in the 135-seat body. For Juan Andres, a laundry shop manager from southern the Spanish city Malaga who has lived in Barcelona for more than 20 years, the projection makes sense. "The process [the word used for the independence saga] has been tiring. My family and I aren't political, but we want some stability," he told Al Jazeera. {articleGUID} "There is something new every day. A new protest, a new arrest, a new declaration. It's too much," he said, as he hoped voting for unionist parties could calm things down. While Puigdemont has reiterated calls for elections, his Democratic Party of Catalonia (PDC) is predicted to come in fourth place. The Republican Left of Catalonia party, headed by Oriol Junqueras, would come first. Junqueras was dismissed as vice president of Catalonia in October. Pro-union parties, such as the right-wing populist Citizens-Party and the centre-left Socialist Party, would respectively take second and third place. Political upheaval The dismissed Catalan government said that 90 percent of voters chose independence in the October 1 referendum, although turnout was less than 50 percent. Following the October 1 referendum, Puigdemont has declared and suspended Catalonia's independence from Spain and unsuccessfully called for dialogue with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. {articleGUID} The Catalan parliament has voted to secede and the Spanish government has stripped the breakaway region of its government through the never-before-used Article 155 of the constitution. There are currently eight former Catalan government ministers being held without bail on charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse of funds. Puigdemont and several other ministers who were called to testify in front of the same Spanish judge who sent the eight ministers to prison remain in Brussels. Al Jazeera's Jonah Hull, reporting from Madrid, said more protests were planned for Sunday in Spain. "This time, people will gather in favour and in support of arrested secessionists," he said. "A lot of people are uncomfortable with a country ... that arrests politicians expected to be involved in the December 21 election."

Family members of dismissed Catalan ministers react after a Spanish judge ordered that the ministers be jailed [Sergio Perez/Reuters] Barcelona, Spain - A Spanish judge has ordered that eight dismissed Catalan ministers be jailed while they are investigated on potential charges of sedition, rebellion and embezzlement. The order was issued on Thursday after state prosecutors, who are investigating the leaders over their involvement in the breakaway region's declaration of independence , requested the ministers be held. Mireia Boya Busquets, a Catalan MP from the far-left Popular Unity Candidacy party, tweeted "the legitimate government is in prison. This is a fascist state. If we normalise it, we erase ourselves as a people". Among those jailed without bail are sacked Catalan Vice President Oriol Junqueras, Jordi Turull, former spokesperson for the government of Catalonia , former Minister of the Workforce Dolors Bassa, and others. The only former minister who may be released is Santi Vila, the former head of the Ministry of Business, pending a 50,000 euro ($58,300) bail payment. Meanwhile, a state prosecutor requested that the National Court issue a European-wide arrest warrant on Thursday for removed Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont and four other sacked ministers. Jaume Alonso-Cuevillas, Puigdemont's Catalan lawyer, tweeted that it was a "grand injustice" and a "sad day for democracy". The Belgian attorney general told Spanish news agency, Efe, that if his office receives a warrant for Puigdemont, the "law will be applied". "If we receive [the warrant], we won't be able to make more comments or conjectures," he said. 'Climate is not good in Madrid' The order and request for the arrest warrant for Puigdemont come after a court appearance by several Catalan leaders in Madrid earlier on Thursday. The Catalan government was sacked last Saturday after they declared independence the previous day. The Spanish prosecutor submitted a complaint against Puigdemont and his government for their push for secession. {articleGUID} Puigdemont remains in Brussels along with four of his former ministers. "The climate is not good [in Madrid], it's better to keep a certain distance," Paul Bekaert, Puigdemont's lawyer in Belgium, told reporters earlier on Thursday. "If they ask, [Puigdemont] will cooperate with Spanish and Belgian authorities," the lawyer added. Commentators had said that Puigdemont's choice to stay in Belgium might cause Spanish courts to hold the accused without bail. The same was done to Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez, two pro-independence organisers held without bail on similar charges. 'We have eight more names to add' Spontaneous protests took place across Barcelona late on Thursday. Thousands gathered in front of the Catalan parliament and palace of the government in Barcelona's Gothic Quarter. Hundreds more circled the Spanish Government delegation on Avenida Diagonal, stopping traffic and forcing public transportation to follow impromptu routes. "The streets will always be ours!" demonstrators chanted. Many bore posters and apparel with the images of Cuixart and Sanchez. "Now we have to add eight more names," Maria, a protester who only gave her first name, told Al Jazeera. 'No one is above the law' Earlier on Thursday, Jose Montilla, a Catalan politician from the Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE) and former president of the Catalan government, criticised Puigdemont and the four dismissed ministers who remained in Belgium. "Enough of the tricks that have led us here," he said. Montilla told Catalan radio he hoped justice would be exercised with "prudence", but reminded the sacked government that "no one is above the law". Centre-left PSOE has joined with the nationalist, centre-right ruling People's Party in their opposition to Catalan independence. {articleGUID} The accused former government is required to deposit 6.7m euros ($7.2m) with the courts. If they are unable to do so, their property will be seized. The Catalan politicians could face up to 30 years in prison for the charges.

Carme Forcadell, speaker of the Catalan parliament, was summoned to Spain's High Court [Sergio Perez/Reuters] Barcelona, Spain - Several dismissed Catalan leaders have appeared before the Spanish High Court and Court of National Audience (CNA) in Madrid on charges of sedition, rebellion and embezzlement. Dismissed Catalan President Carles Puigdemont and 13 officials from his government were scheduled to appear before the CNA on Thursday, while six members of the Catalan parliament went before the Spanish High Court. Reports from Madrid said declarations before both courts were short. The Catalan government was sacked last Saturday after they declared independence the previous day. The Spanish prosecutor submitted a complaint against Puigdemont and his government for their push for secession. Puigdemont remains in Brussels along with four of his former ministers. The Spanish prosecutor may now issue a European Union-wide warrant for his arrest. {articleGUID} "The climate is not good [in Madrid], it's better to keep a certain distance," Paul Bekaert, Puigdemont's lawyer in Belgium, told reporters on Thursday. "If they ask, [Puigdemont] will cooperate with Spanish and Belgian authorities," the lawyer added. It remains to be seen how Belgium will respond to the warrant. Many assume Puigdemont remains in Brussels to apply for political asylum, though he said in a press conference on Monday this was not his intention. Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel has reportedly "implored" his ministers not to speak on the issue of Catalonia . Commentators have said that Puigdemont's choice to stay in Belgium may cause Spanish courts to hold the accused without bail. The same was done to Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez, two pro-independence organisers held without bail on similar charges. Jose Montilla, a Catalan politician from the Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE) and former president of the Catalan government, criticised Puigdemont and the four dismissed ministers who remained in Belgium: "Enough of the tricks that have led us here," he said. Montilla told Catalan radio he hoped justice would be exercised with "prudence", but reminded the sacked government that "no one is above the law". Centre-left PSOE has joined with the nationalist, centre-right ruling People's Party in their opposition to Catalan independence. {articleGUID} The accused former government is required to deposit 6.7m euros ($7.2m) with the courts. If they are unable to do so, their property will be seized. The Catalan politicians could face up to 30 years in prison for the charges.

Puigdemont held a news conference at Press Club Brussels Europe on Tuesday [Yves Herman/Reuters] Barcelona, Spain - Dismissed Catalan President Carles Puigdemont has remained in Brussels instead of returning to Barcelona to face a summons for rebellion, sedition and other charges relative to Catalonia's declaration of independence. Joaquim Forn and Dolors Bassa, the former ministers of the Interior and Labour, returned late Tuesday night. It was originally reported Puigdemont boarded the plane alongside them, but those reports later turned out to be false. Forn and Bassa were met by a large group of taunting pro-union demonstrators at Barcelona’s airport last night. They chanted "Welcome to Spain!" and "Where's your Republic?" as the dismissed functionaries returned. Paul Bekaert, Puigdemont's lawyer in Belgium, told Dutch television that the dismissed president will not return to Spain: "No, he won't go because he prefers to observe and wait." {articleGUID} The Catalan government was sacked after they declared independence last Friday. The Spanish prosecutor submitted a complaint against Puigdemont and 13 members of his government for the declaration of independence. The former Catalan government is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday and Friday. The 14 ex-ministers must pay a deposit 6.2m euros ($7.2m). The court has said their property will be seized if they cannot deliver the total amount. Nuria Bou, a 32-year-old accountant enjoying a coffee in Barcelona on Wednesday morning, said Puigdemont choosing to stay in Brussels was troubling. "People used to escape to Mexico or France under Franco," Bou said, referring to the far-right dictatorship that controlled Spain from 1939 to 1975. Catalan and other minority languages and public display of culture were made illegal under his rule. Those who tried to institute reforms were either arrested or fled to other countries. "Have we reached that point again?" Bou asked. The accountant went on to say that it was discouraging that Puigdemont chose to stay in Brussels as his ministers returned. "He doesn't want to become a martyr," Bou said, "but maybe that's what we need." Josep Costa, a professor of political science at Barcelona's Universitat Pompeu Fabra who specialises in the right of self-determination, cautioned that Catalans should wait for Puigdemont's explanation. "People basically expect they will be jailed without trial." Spain is currently pursuing expedited legal proceedings against the former Catalan government, as well as the former head of Catalonia's police force, Josep Lluis Trapero. {articleGUID} There are also two pro-independence organisers, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez of Omnium Cultural and the Catalan National Assembly, respectively, are currently being held without bail pending trial. Cuixart and Sanchez were charged with sedition for their separatism. They have become rallying points for pro-independence demonstrators in Catalonia. Considering their detention, "it makes sense that at least the president does not surrender himself," Costa concluded. Judge Carmen Lamela of the National Audience court is expected to ask the Spanish prosecutor to issue a warrant for Puigdemont's arrest, valid in all of the European Union if the Catalan leader does not appear. Puigdemont said on Tuesday that he did not go to Belgium to apply for political asylum, though it is one of the few nations that allows citizens of other EU states to apply for political asylum.

The aftermath of a shelling by jet planes allegedly loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in Idlib [REUTERS] The tables started turning on Syria's tyrant Bashar al-Assad last year when his troops lost Wadi al-Daif and al-Hamediya in the Idlib countryside, the regime's largest military camp in the north, to opposition forces. And the snowball effect continues. Fighting under the banner of "Jaish al-Fateh" (the Army of Conquest), some 12,000 fighters captured Idlib and Jisr al-Shugur without considerable losses. Undoubtedly, Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz's initiated Operation Decisive Storm in Yemen and the rapprochement between Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey consolidated political and material support for the Syrian fighters. The heroics of the Syrian people aside, the real decisive factor appears to reside outside the country's borders rather than within - at least for now. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(4248381065001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_4248381065001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > ISIL captures strategic Syrian city of Palmyra PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The defeat in Idlib province coincided with the fighters successfully shattering the siege around Aleppo, which had been imposed by Iranian General Qasim Soleimani with heavy participation from Afghan mercenary militias. The Hazara fighters from Shia regions of Afghanistan haven't achieved much for their Iranian master on the plains of Syria. In Aleppo and Busra Harir, hundreds of Afghans lost their lives after failing to retreat in time. Strategic gains Recently, the Jaish al-Fateh made strategic gains in al-Mastouma camp and Jabal al-Arbaeen, posing serious threats to the Alawite stronghold. The advance towards the region poses the most significant survival struggle for Assad, his ally Hezbollah and mentor Iran. With his loyalist troops imploding due to fatigue, demoralisation and attrition, Hezbollah is set to face greater battlefield pressure. The extremist militia is already suffering heavily in Qalamoun along the Lebanese border. On top of all this comes the humiliating defeat in Palmyra at the hands of ISIL. The regime's troops are now in their worst ever defensive position. While Assad faces disgracing strategic debacles, there is hardly any good news on the political front. The Syrian delegation, visiting Iran recently, begged for more help in exchange for state property. The world may have never heard of such a humiliating deal by a tyrant who wants to fund a losing war. Iran has tried to assert its presence with the help of Hezbollah, which has been holding on to the Qalamoun heights, which offer a link to the Mediterranean shore. Interestingly, US Secretary of State John Kerry flew to Moscow in a bid to find a political solution amid Syrian fighters' advance. The top US diplomat made the move after a meeting with Khalid Khoja, the leader of the Syrian opposition. He had categorically stated then Assad has no role in any future political settlement. Hala Qadamani wrote an interesting reportage for French newspaper Liberation with quotes from the people of Damascus. She writes that no one is questioning whether or not the regime will fall; rather it's about when and how it will fall. The biggest loss Assad has suffered is the support from the intelligentsia. Public approval of Assad has fallen drastically in every sphere, from military to political, from public to diplomatic. Honour and property While Assad's fractured spying system struggles to remain functional, the people are forming their own committees for the protection of their honour and property. A clip of a conversation posted on YouTube between Colonel Suhail al-Hasan alias "al-Nimer" with his commanding officer after the defeat in Jisr al-Shugur sums up the inner workings of the junta. The colonel is seen begging for munitions for his 800 fleeing soldiers. On the economic front, the Syrian lira has hit the lowest mark in its history. In the open market, one gets 330 liras for one US dollar. Moreover, the regime has been unable to pay public servants' salaries for the last four months. In neighbourhoods like al-Maliki, the residents are packing their bags to leave for Europe or the Gulf region. A Lebanese newspaper quoted a minister recently saying that Beirut is preparing to host Assad loyalists. The non-stop advance of Syrian fighters calls for a high-level conference of stakeholders in Riyadh to chalk out a future strategy ahead of the regime's collapse. Assad wants to remain in denial mode, as has historically been the nature of totalitarian regimes. The Alawite regime is likely to be no different until the Iranians decide to pull out the carpet from beneath their feet. To save Syria from descending into an all-out civil war like Afghanistan, now is the time to manage the transition process. Ahmad Zaidan is Al Jazeera's Islamabad bureau chief.

A Syrian vendor arranging pins displaying portraits of Assad with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah [Getty] As if the severe damage inflicted by the US-led invasion of Iraq and the Israeli occupation of Palestine were not enough, the Arab world is now engaged in a self-destructive process of sectarian polarisation and violence. While it is true that the 2003 Iraq War triggered the rise of sectarian groups, many Arab political leaders, religious preachers and even some intellectuals have been fanning sectarian hatred and bigotry to serve what is essentially a struggle for power and influence. What we are witnessing is an ugly sectarianisation of Arab societies that is affecting people's outlook, terminology and attitude as people get trapped in superficial trenches that cloud minds and close hearts. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(4623143979001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_4623143979001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > UpFront - Reality Check : The myth of a Sunni-Shia War PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The ensuing state of confusion and fear compel many to accept "sectarian-wrapped" myths that demonise one sect or another, and even condone, in the case of ISIL, horrific crimes against Christian minorities and Iraq's Yazidis. Sectarian language Sectarian language is no longer the specialty of openly sectarian parties, but is steadily penetrating the mainstream lingo - expressed either in specific terminology or in supposedly neutral "analyses" of political developments in the region and beyond. For example, some now see Iran as behind all catastrophes - this was recently evident when Iranian pilgrims were accused of having deliberately caused the stampede in Mecca last September and in the enduring claim that the Iran-Iraq war was sparked by a sinister Shia plan to control the Sunnis in the Arab World. Also read: Shattering the myths about Kuwaiti Shia The fact that more than 450 Iranians were killed in the stampede or the fact that the 1981 war started when the late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein abrogated the 1975 Algiers agreement over border disputes are conveniently overlooked. A sectarian anti-Shia language was not dominant in the Arab collective psyche which was more shaped by the legacy of the anti-colonialist struggle and commitment to the Palestinian cause. Strangely enough, such sectarian language was not prevalent during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, even though it was pro-Western Arab governments - ie, those with Sunni majority countries - that instigated Saddam to provoke the war. Certainly, chauvinist propaganda was strongly present but as ugly as it was, it was not sectarian but an attempt to rally the masses behind a pan-Arabist Iraqi defence of the Arab world against a supposed historic Persian conspiracy to conquer the Arab world. To be sure, Iran did its part in fuelling anti-Arabism - I experienced it first hand during my stint as reporter from Tehran in 1995 - but it engaged in this enterprise more seriously, in its nurturing and training of a sectarian Iraqi Shia groups who returned to Iraq after the US invasion of the country. Anti-colonialism and Palestine Prior to this, a sectarian anti-Shia language was not dominant in the Arab collective psyche which was more shaped by the legacy of the anti-colonialist struggle and commitment to the Palestinian cause. Therefore, a majority of Arabs, unlike the pro-Western Arab governments, openly supported and celebrated the Iranian revolution in 1979 that overthrew Reza Pahlavi's regime, seen as the region's "gendarmerie" protecting US and Israeli interests. It was the pro-Western Arab regimes, who feared and incited against post-revolution Iran, not on a sectarian basis, but out of fierce rivalry over influence and control. Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, circa 1955 [Getty] It was not until more than a decade later that fear of exaggerated Iranian influence over Shia Muslims in the Gulf states became an overwhelming concern for these regimes - a claim that was also used as pretext to suppress domestic opposition. The rallying against "the Shia threat" that started in full swing in 2004, was part of the US-backed formation of an axis of so-called "moderate" Arab states versus the Iranian-led Shia axis, aimed at undermining support for Hezbollah and Hamas, as resisters against Israel. It was King Abdullah of Jordan who in 2004, and again in 2007, made the anti-Shia sentiment more acceptable by advocating the urgency of countering the expansion of a Shia crescent in the region. Also read: Did Arab uprisings deepen the Sunni-Shia divide? The Jordanian monarch was talking about the expansion of an Iranian-sponsored political-ideological crescent, rather than a religious confrontation, but his words fed the rising beast of sectarianism and polarisation. The catchphrases 'Shia expansion' and 'Shia threat' have seeped into the spoken and written Arabic language... The catchphrases "Shia expansion" and "Shia threat" have seeped into the spoken and written Arabic language, in addition to intentional descriptions of Shia as "Khawarij" (those who left Islam), and Safawis (a reference to the Safavid dynasty that ruled Iran in the 16th century). Prejudiced preachers It is shocking to find many in the Arab intelligentsia not only using such derogatory language but seem duped to prejudiced preachers such as the Saudi preacher Mohammad al-Arifi who has been fomenting flames of hostility against the Shia . The suppression of the predominantly Sunni resistance against the US military in Iraq, by Baghdad's sectarian Shia-led government, is touted as proof of an eternal Shia hatred for Sunnis, and not as a functional alliance of power. The Alawite-led Syrian regime's violent crackdown on Syria's popular uprising, eventually leading to the emergence of extremist Sunni groups is yet another chapter written in a gloomy script. But it was ISIL that was the first to declare "war on the Shia" in, a letter by its founder the Jordanian Abu Musaab al-Zarqawi , who was killed in 2006, to deputy commander of al-Qaeda Ayman al-Zawahiri who immediately rejected the idea as leading to "Muslims killing Muslims". Anti-Shia propaganda, however, did not affect the popularity of the Lebanese Shia Hezbollah movement until the group sent forces to Syria to aid the regime . Hassan Nasrallah justified the action as a necessary protection of the shrine of historic Shia hero Sayeda Zeinab located in Southern Damascus. Hezbollah's slide into the Syrian quagmire fell perfectly into the "Shia threat" narrative. The movement was no longer seen by many of its admirers as a resistance movement but as an Iranian-controlled sectarian actor. Divisive slogan The shift in attitudes towards Hezbollah marked a dangerous turn wherein the divisive slogan of "resisting the Shia" replaced the unifying slogans of "resisting Israel" and "Bread, liberation and social justice" of the Arab revolutions. Deflecting Arab people's attention from the struggle for Palestinian rights and from socioeconomic grievances suits the purposes of Arab regimes to justify their alliances with the US and the oppression of Arab dissent. Tearing apart Arab societies in the process, is not that relevant for most Arab regimes as sectarianism has become another tool to divide people, dominate them and justify wars and repression. In the end, the US neo-cons, who have pushed for such narratives since the 1990s, can now retire and rest - many Arabs for various reasons and purposes, are implementing the prophesy of an eventual break-up of the Arab world into sectarian splinters.

Saad Hariri has to rebuild his bloc first, and take the initiative to reach out to Hezbollah as never before has there been so much to play for and so little bargain with, writes Jay [EPA] After five years of self-imposed exile, Saad Hariri's return to Lebanon has been met with mixed feelings, both by his own supporters and his enemies - in this tiny, troubled country, which awkwardly straddles regional superpowers Iran and Saudi Arabia. For years many have argued that something has to give in this bizarre set up which allowed Saudi Arabia to financially support key sectors of Lebanon's society, while turning a blind eye to Hezbollah's grasp of power and Iran's proximity. That breaking point was reached recently, leaving many to wonder if Lebanon can ever be a two-speed state again. But has Hariri's return to Lebanese politics come too late to get the country back on an even keel? The love-hate relationship that Lebanon and Saudi Arabia enjoyed took a turn for the worse when Riyadh cancelled a $3bn military grant to beef up the Lebanese army. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(4612146862001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_4612146862001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > Inside Story - How exposed is Lebanon to Syrian war? PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY It was as though the build-up of pressure had reached the point where a main fuse blew; days later Lebanon's justice minister resigned citing Hezbollah domination after the release of one of its coalition ministers from jail. Commentators argue that Saudi Arabia simply wasn't getting enough bang for its buck. Certainly it became harder for Riyadh to share Lebanon with its enemy, when the former became despondent and the latter emboldened. Possible scenarios But there are other factors that made the Saudis defy the logic of a rich man who can't accept that he's paid millions for a fake Rembrandt. The Syrian Civil War, which Hezbollah entered in 2013, might have sullied the cherished view of the Lebanese state for the Saudis - with recent gains there further annoying minds in Riyadh, but more recently Hariri's own entourage have been behaving badly as well. The writing was on the wall for quite some time. Since early 2014, Saudi-backed media outlets in Lebanon have known that their sponsors were deeply unhappy as they stopped their cheques. One might even blame Lebanon's flagship titles for not pandering to their sponsors' needs as even March 14 media failed to act, when it was needed. The elite in Lebanon have behaved like compulsive gamblers at the blackjack table, doubling their bet every time they win - only to finally to lose everything - and then to walk away from the game. But the recent move might not play into Saudi hands. If Lebanon has to rely on its army to fight the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) on its borders without the military kit it needs, this will put enormous pressure on the present caretaker government. If extremists take any more hostages, for example, this will merely bolster Hezbollah's argument that it needs to take control of the security operations against ISIL - opening up an old wound that the Shia group is behaving like a state within a state. Lebanon's Prime Minister Tammam Salam would probably resign if any hostage situation emerged due to the army being outfoxed - which could trigger chaos. Yet, could this be what the Saudis want. Could such disarray strengthen the March 14 block, which has in recent months been indulging in in-fighting? For Hezbollah, wouldn't such a scenario overstretch its resources with such security work? And wouldn't such a move give a new impetus to Hariri as the only one who can normalise the situation. Once installed as prime minister, he could no doubt procure considerable amounts of cash from Riyadh for Lebanon's army - the only real institution to offer a token counterweight to Hezbollah's might? OPINION: What's to become of Lebanon? If this is the gambit, however, might Iran not seize the moment to capitalise on the paralysis in Lebanon? In so many ways, Lebanon is already an Iranian satellite, and perhaps this latest "coup de grace" by Riyadh might end Hariri's bid to save the country from the abyss - while the country's political classes display a shocking disregard for dialogue. Many fear that Hezbollah thrives on the crisis in Lebanon as its aim is to take more power through a shake-up of the establishment . Common sense And yet, unity and rebuilding the state machine - so that three-metre high mountains of rubbish can be removed - should be the priority now for the prodigious Hariri. Common sense is the only thing that can save the country from a hell left by an outdated secular system that has sired a breed of politician who place themself first, their clan second and their political group third - with "state" and "country" a mere postscript. The elite in Lebanon have behaved like compulsive gamblers at the blackjack table, doubling their bet every time they win only to finally to lose everything - and then to walk away from the game. The recent splenetic outbursts of Samir Gaegea to apparently jump ship and support Hezbollah's candidate in the presidential election, and the recent resignation of the justice minister, are ominous signs: Hariri has to rebuild his bloc first, and take the initiative to reach out to Hezbollah because never before has there been so much to play for and so little bargain with. Even a token form of unity, which dampens Hezbollah's fiery rhetoric towards Lebanon's friends in Riyadh, could move mountains. This is his time to show the Lebanese that he is prepared to place his country before his own political aspirations and lead by example.

An aerial view of Beirut, capital of a divided Lebanon [Reuters] Lebanon is a diverse and industrious nation and that's a cause for celebration. But the Lebanese are a divided people, and that is a major cause for trepidation. Since its 14-year civil war ended with a peace accord signed in Saudi Arabia in November 1989, Lebanon has tried hard to maintain its plurality while at the same time "managing" its sectarian divisions. But many Lebanese insist that they could only do so much against the regional odds; that their nation is a victim of conflicts instigated or manufactured by foreign powers that projected their differences on to this open and all-too-fragile nation. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(4700391192001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_4700391192001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > Inside Story - New laws bar Syrians from taking refuge in Lebanon PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY They grumble about foreigners waging proxy wars on Lebanese soil. And there is some truth to that. Just as much truth as in the fact that they have been the local foot soldiers abetting, enacting and executing these wars and conflicts. So much so that at times it's not clear whether foreign powers exploited the Lebanese to advance their regional interests, or whether the Lebanese factions used foreign assistance to fight each other and expand their own narrow interests. A decade of tensions Over the past decade, most of the regional tensions projected in or on Lebanon were between the allies of Syria and Iran, and those allied with Gulf and other Arab states. READ MORE: Lebanon has just done the unthinkable Lebanese tensions peaked after the assassination of Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri in February 2005, leading to the Cedar Revolution - a series of mass demonstrations demanding the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon and the establishment of an international tribunal to investigate Hariri's assassination, which they blamed on Syria and Hezbollah. Riyadh and its Gulf allies have grown exasperated with Hezbollah's growing influence over the Lebanese state. They accuse it of causing the country's political paralysis and its presidential crisis. Syrian forces withdrew soon after in April and the United Nations established the tribunal. But Lebanon continued to simmer, leading to a series of assassinations and sporadic violence in addition to two wars against Israel. During the initial turbulent period, the Lebanese political factions consolidated into two opposing blocs: the March 8 coalition of pro-Syrian and pro-Iranian groups, and the March 14 coalition that leaned closer to Gulf and Arab positions. The labels came after two of their massive March 2005 demonstrations galvanised and polarised the entire country. The following decade had its ups and downs with the two blocs competing and conflicting, and at times reconciling in coalition governments. But this was a decade of more downs than ups. A case in point has been the regional crisis over Syria that has polarised the Lebanese. Except this time it wasn't over Syria's intervention in Lebanon, rather over Hezbollah fighting in Syria on the side of Bashar al-Assad and the Iranian regime. Paying the price Riyadh and its Gulf allies have grown exasperated with Hezbollah's growing influence over the Lebanese state. They accuse it of causing the country's political paralysis and its presidential crisis. Lebanon hasn't had a president for two years. They are also angered by Hezbollah's anti-Saudi activities in Syria, Yemen and other Arab countries. A poster with the portrait of former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri during a Beirut rally to mark the 11th anniversary of his assassination [EPA] Fed up, Saudi Arabia announced this week that it was halting $4bn of military and security aid to Lebanon. And along with the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain, they are suspending all travel by their citizens to Lebanon. All of which has forced Lebanese Prime Minister Tammam Salam to make conciliatory statements in support of Saudi Arabia and in support of Arab unity (vis-a-vis Iran). But Riyadh is not satisfied and more punitive actions will be forthcoming if the Lebanese government doesn't take certain measures to restrain Hezbollah. If the kingdom and its allies further escalate their punitive measures against Lebanon, as some Saudi officials warned indirectly, it could badly hurt the struggling Lebanese economy. READ MORE: Lebanon's sleeping demons For example, limits on - or a ban of - Lebanese businesses and expats could have a major financial and psychological effect on Lebanon. Remittances from Lebanese citizens in the Gulf comprise a significant chunk of its $80bn economy. According to the World Bank, of the $6.7bn in remittances annually, 70 percent come from Lebanese expatriates living in the Gulf states. Likewise, if the Gulf states decide to pull their deposits from Lebanon's central bank, and suspend all investment in its real estate, an important factor in economic growth, the Lebanese currency and economy could suffer badly. Lebanon is in a bind Hezbollah has lost its raison d'etre, but it is not about to sever its relations with Iran, or stop its destabilising activities. And the March 14 block can hardly neutralise Hezbollah without an escalation to civil war that no one can win, but which could destroy the country. Worse, a growing number of Lebanese and Arabs fear Hezbollah is maintaining the current political paralysis because it is bent on changing the entire governing system in Lebanon to suit its interests. This means scrapping the Taif political accord reached in Saudi Arabia in 1989, and replacing it with one that advances its influence and eventually strengthens Iran’s role in the eastern Mediterranean. To be clear, changing a quarter of a century's transitional system based on a sectarian division of authority should be welcomed, but not if it leads to an imbalance of power where one group dictates policy to the rest. It was this unjust system that led to the Lebanese civil war in the first place. In sum, the national and regional dynamics have become so intertwined in Lebanon that it is hard to see how Lebanon could emerge from them politically stable and economically sound. Only if they pull back from the brink and act wisely by putting the interests of their country first will they be able to save themselves from the regional turmoil; s tarting with Hezbollah ending its reckless military adventures in Syria on the side of dictatorship; and eventually, reaching a consensus on the best way forward for the country.

AUB was founded in 1866 and is considered one of the Middle East's leading universities [H Malla/AP] A Lebanese university will pay $700,000 to settle a US lawsuit over allegations it provided "material support" to entities linked to Hezbollah , US officials said. The American University of Beirut (AUB) confirmed in a statement on Friday it was settling the lawsuit, which charged it had violated the terms of grants it received from US Agency for International Development (USAID). The US Attorney's Office in Manhattan announced the deal on Thursday, saying AUB would be required to pay the US government $700,000 and revise its internal policies to ensure future compliance with US law. "For years, the American University of Beirut accepted grant money from USAID, but failed to take reasonable steps to ensure against providing material support to entities on the Treasury Department's prohibited list," said Acting Manhattan US Attorney Joon H Kim said. "With today's settlement, the University is being made to pay a financial penalty for its conduct, and importantly, it has admitted to its conduct and agreed to put proper precautions in place to ensure that it does not happen again." Media training The civil lawsuit charged that AUB violated US law by providing media training between 2007-2009 to representatives of two media outlets - Al-Nour Radio and Al-Manar television - under US sanctions for their ties to Hezbollah. It also accused AUB of listing the Hezbollah-linked Jihad al-Binaa, also under US sanctions, on the university's NGO database. Hezbollah, a Shia political and military organisation with members in Lebanon 's parliament and government, is listed as a "terrorist" group in the United States and entities linked to it are also under sanctions. READ MORE: Lebanon braced for fallout of US law on Hezbollah In its statement, AUB said it acknowledged the accusations but it insisted "AUB does not agree that its conduct was knowing, intentional or reckless". It welcomed the settlement and said it would conduct additional training of faculty and staff on US law going forward. AUB was founded in 1866 and is considered one of the Middle East's leading universities. Hezbollah 'funding' In a separate case on Friday, a Lebanese businessman who the US says has provided millions of dollars to Hezbollah has pleaded not guilty to federal criminal charges. Kassim Tajideen, who was arrested in Morocco earlier this month, made his first court appearance in Washington on Friday. He was ordered detained after prosecutors called him a flight risk. An 11-count indictment unsealed on Friday accuses Tajeddine of violating the sanctions against the Lebanese group. A lawyer for Tajideen declined to comment after the court appearance.

Hezbollah maintains that Mustafa Badreddine was killed near Damascus by artillery fire from rebel groups fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But a war monitoring group said no rebel shelling occurred in the area at that time . Israeli Lieutenant-General Gadi Eisenkot told an academic conference on Tuesday that Badreddine's death last May illustrated "the depth of the internal crisis of Hezbollah". He said Israel "believes that he was killed by his own officers".

Hezbollah has deployed thousands of fighters in Syria, where Badreddine had led its intervention in support of Assad's forces, which are also backed by Russia and Iran. Israeli intelligence claims Badreddine had been feuding with Iranian military commanders in Syria over the heavy losses his group had suffered on the battlefield. In Beirut, Mohammed Afif, a Hezbollah spokesman, said Israel's allegations were "lies that do not deserve comment". The US government has said Badreddine, 55, was in charge of Hezbollah's military operations in Syria. He was one of five Hezbollah members indicted by the UN-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon in 2005 in connection to the killing of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik al-Hariri and 21 others. Hezbollah denied any involvement in Hariri's killing and said the charges were politically motivated. READ MORE: Slain Hezbollah operative's role shrouded in mystery For years, Badreddine masterminded military operations against Israel from Lebanon and overseas, and managed to evade capture by Arab and Western governments. Israel, which invaded Lebanon in 2006 to fight Hezbollah and has targeted the group in Syria over alleged arms transfers, called his death good news but stopped short of claiming responsibility. Badreddine was a student of Imad Mughniyeh, Hezbollah's previous military chief, who was considered one of the world's most-wanted terrorists by Israel and the United States. Mughniyeh, who was Badreddine's brother-in-law, was killed in a 2008 car bombing in Damascus that Hezbollah blamed on Israel. In a letter written shortly after Baddredine's death, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif extended condolences "for the martyrdom of this great jihadist ... who embodied devotion and vigour and was legendary in his defence of high Islamic goals and his defence of the Lebanese people who resist oppression and terrorism".

Syrian siege and evacuations 60 buses and ambulances heading to Idlib from Madaya and Zabadani with 2,200 people 75 buses and ambulances heading to Aleppo from Fouaa and Kefraya with 5,000 people UN: 643,780 people living in 13 besieged locations need humanitarian assistance UN: 3.9 million people live in hard-to-reach areas which aid groups cannot reach The transfer has begun in Syria of residents of two rebel-held towns in exchange for moving rebel fighters and civilians out of two other towns under an evacuation agreement. Zabadani and Madaya, both located near the capital Damascus, are besieged by the army of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and allied fighters from Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia group. Convoys of buses began transporting people from the two towns on Friday under a coordinated population swap that involves a total of four towns. Fouaa and Kefraya, in northwestern Idlib province, are home to mostly Shia Muslims but have been encircled by Syrian rebels since March 2014. Residents leaving them will be taken to government-held areas in adjoining Aleppo province. 'Living in the unknown' Houssam Mahmmoud, a Madaya resident, was in one of the 60 buses taking civilians to Idlib on Friday. "I left my mother behind. She refused to leave her home and her land," he told Al Jazeera by Skype from the bus.

"We have been living in the unknown, only to be displaced to another unknown," said Mahmmoud. "[The coordinators] told us to pack one bag only. Each person was given one bag to pack his life and move away. "They woke us up at around 3am and told us we have to hurry. We ran like crazy trying to find our buses." The transfer was scheduled to begin last week, but has been postponed at least four times. In advance of the population transfer, at least 50 buses entered Zabadani and Madaya while 100 buses and 20 ambulances arrived in Fouaa and Kefraya on Thursday. From Idlib to Aleppo Al Jazeera's Hoda Abdel-Hamid, reporting on Friday from Hatay in southern Turkey near the Syrian border, said the buses started to move early in the morning. "The first buses that moved were the ones leaving Idlib. They have arrived in Aleppo province. "They are still in rebel-controlled areas in western Aleppo and will stay there for a while. "Those moving from Zabadani and Madaya have a much longer way to go through government-controlled areas because there is a lack of trust between the two sides. "The ones who have reached Aleppo will stay where they are until the others moving from Zabadani and Madaya reach rebel-controlled areas. This is a staggered movement of population." Fouaa and Kefraya are home to mostly Shia Muslims [Ammar Abdullah/Reuters] An activist in Fouaa, who requested anonymity, told Al Jazeera that rockets targeted some of the buses on their way out, causing damage to one bus and injuring two people. "There are at least 7,500 people expecting to be evacuated, among them are at least 1,500 rebel fighters," he said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), the UK-based monitoring group, said at least 2,100 residents, including rebel fighters, are due to be evacuated from Zabadani and Madaya and transported to Idlib. INTERACTIVE: Idlib province - Who controls what The transfer is part of a deal brokered by Iran and Qatar that will see more than 10,000 people evacuated and hundreds of prisoners exchanged. According to the UN, at least 4.7 million people are living in hard-to-reach and besieged areas in Syria and are exposed to grave protection threats. As the Syrian conflict enters its seventh year, more than 465,000 people have been killed in the fighting, more than a million injured and over 12 million Syrians - half the country's prewar population - have been displaced from their homes.

Hashem Safieddine, left, is spoken of as a potential candidate to become Hezbollah's next secretary general [Ali Hashisho/Reuters] Saudi Arabia on Friday designated Hashem Safieddine, the head of Hezbollah's executive council, as a "terrorist", accusing him of advising the armed group to carry out "terrorist operations" and of supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Safieddine, a Lebanese citizen in his 50s, runs the group's political affairs and social and economic programmes in Lebanon's Shia community. He is a cousin of Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's secretary general, and is spoken of as a potential candidate to succeed him and take charge of the movement. "The Saudi government will continue to combat Hezbollah's terrorist activities with all available legal tools," the official Saudi news agency said, quoting a royal decree statement. "[It] will continue to work with partners around the world to make it clear that Hezbollah's militant and extremist activities should not be tolerated by any nation." In March 2016 , GCC member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, known as the GCC, classified Hezbollah as a "terrorist" organisation, citing "hostile actions" by the armed group. "As long as Hezbollah spreads instability, conducts terrorist attacks and engages in criminal and illicit activities around the world, we will continue to designate Hezbollah's operatives, leaders and businesses, impose sanctions as a result of designation, and disrupt its radical activities," the statement by Saudi's government said.

RenderPagesVideo('5519615349001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Fighting between Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and a former al-Qaeda affiliate on the Syria-Lebanon border halted on Thursday after a ceasefire was reached, Lebanese media and Hezbollah outlets reported. The truce in the mountainous Juroud Arsal area between the Iran-backed Shia group and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham , previously known as al-Nusra Front, was struck after a week of fighting. The ceasefire was confirmed by Hezbollah's al-Manar TV website and Lebanese National News Agency (NNA), which said the pause was part of a deal brokered by the country's general security agency chief Major General Abbas Ibrahim. "The al-Nusra fighters and their families will go to Idlib," a province in northwestern Syria largely under the control of the jihadists, NNA said. Hezbollah said the ceasefire came into force at 6am (03:00 GMT) and halted fighting on all fronts. The development comes a day after the leader of the Hezbollah group said that the group was close to defeating Jabhat Fateh al-Sham in the battle along the Syrian-Lebanese border. "We are in the face of a very big military victory," Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech on Wednesday. The rival fighters have "effectively lost" most of the land they held in the barren, mountainous border region of Jroud Arsal, he added. RELATED: Syria's civil war explained from the beginning As soon as fighting ends, Hezbollah would be ready to hand over territory it has captured if the Lebanese army requests it, Nasrallah said. Al-Nusra Front, formerly al-Qaeda's Syria branch, severed ties with the latter and rebranded itself as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham last year. Hezbollah has made rapid advances since it launched an offensive with the Syrian army on Friday to drive Jabhat Fateh al-Sham from their last foothold along the frontier. Al Jazeera's Imtiaz Tyab, reporting from Beirut, said that Hezbollah captured the area in question in a quick offensive over a matter of days. "Hezbollah has been calling for talks in order to reach a settlement. It appears the sides reached some sort of a settlement, but the details of this deal are yet to be announced," he said. "However, what we know for a fact is that the fighting has stopped." ISIL expected to be next target The next phase of the operation is expected to target a nearby enclave in the hands of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) group.

Hezbollah has played a major role in fighting armed groups in the border region during the six-year Syrian war and provided critical military support to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . On the Syrian side of the border, Hezbollah fought "shoulder to shoulder" with the Syrian army around the town of Fleita in recent days and cleared the area of rival fighters, Nasrallah said. Nasrallah stressed that his movement is "very cautious" not to endanger the lives of any Syrian refugees living in informal camps on the outskirts of Arsal. Security sources say some two dozen Hezbollah fighters have been killed overall in the battle, and nearly 150 from the other side.

Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri (L) and Trump (R) during a press conference in the Rose Garden of the White House [Carlos Barria/Reuters] US President Donald Trump accused Syria's leader Bashar al-Assad on Tuesday of committing "horrible" crimes against humanity and vowed to prevent his regime from carrying out any more chemical attacks. Speaking at a White House press conference with Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri, Trump also called the Lebanese Shia armed group, Hezbollah , a threat to the entire Middle East. "I'm not a fan of Assad. I certainly think that what he's done to that country and to humanity is horrible," Trump said. Recalling that he had ordered cruise missile attacks on Assad for using chemical weapons, Trump said: "I am not somebody that will stand by and let him get away with what he tried to do". OPINION: Why Trump's foreign policy is dangerous Trump also said he believed there might not be any Russian or Iranian involvement in Syria today had former President Barack Obama taken action against Assad. Trump accused Hezbollah and Iran of heightening the humanitarian disaster in Syria. "Hezbollah is a menace to the Lebanese state, the Lebanese people and the entire region," he said. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5520927069001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5520927069001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > Hezbollah’s Syria offensive on agenda of Lebanon-US talks "The group continues to increase its military arsenal which threatens to start yet another conflict with Israel," Trump added. "With the support of Iran, the organisation is also fueling humanitarian catastrophe in Syria." Hezbollah's "true interests are those of itself and its sponsor, Iran," he said. Trump demurred when asked to comment on sanctions against Hezbollah. "I'll be making my position very clear over the next 24 hours," he said. "I have meetings with some of my very expert military representatives and others, so I'll be making that decision very shortly." Trump praised Hariri for his nation's effort in hosting Syrian refugees. "I want to thank the prime minister and the Lebanese people for giving shelter to those victimised by ISIS [ISIL, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant], the Assad regime and their supporters and sponsors, and pledge our continued support to Lebanon," Trump said at a press conference with Hariri. Trump, who has sought to halt the acceptance of Syrian refugees into the United States and vowed cuts to US foreign aid programmes, stressed the importance of helping people close to home and said the US would continue to provide humanitarian support to efforts in Lebanon . OPINION: Xenophobia will not solve Lebanon’s refugee crisis "Our approach, supporting the humanitarian needs of displaced Syrian citizens as close to their home country as possible, is the best way to help most people," he said. Hariri pointed to the challenges faced by his nation in hosting some 1.5 million displaced Syrians. Syrian refugees make up about 25 percent of Lebanon's population of about 6 million people. Another item on the prime minister's agenda is continued US support for the Lebanese military. Trump praised the Lebanese army for "fighting continually to guard Lebanon's border and prevent ISIS and other terrorists... from gaining a foothold inside their country." "The United States military has been proud to help in that fight and will continue to do so," he said. "America's assistance can help ensure that the Lebanese army is the only defender Lebanon needs." The current draft state department budget calls for cuts in US military assistance and analysts say Lebanon could be among the countries affected.

A Lebanese army soldier is seen on a military vehicle as pictured from Ras Baalbek, Lebanon August 19, 2017. REUTERS/ Ali Hashisho [Reuters] A mine blast killed three Lebanese soldiers on Sunday as they were heading to take part in an offensive against ISIL along the border with Syria , the army said. Lebanon's army began its operation in the Ras Baalbek and Qaa region early on Saturday, and has already recaptured two-thirds of the territory in the area, the military said. The retaken area covers about 80 square kilometres once controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) group, the army said.

"The toughest battle will be to retake the remaining 40 percent because it is there that Daesh fighters are gathered. Nevertheless, the army is ready," said the source, using an Arabic acronym for ISIL. The soldiers killed on Sunday were on their way to join the offensive to remove ISIL, the military said in a statement. "An army vehicle was hit by a landmine on the al-Najsa road roundabout in Jurud Arsal at noon today, killing three soldiers and injuring one soldier seriously," it read. The statement said the wounded soldier was evacuated to hospital. The battle against ISIL is being fought further north from Jurud Arsal, along the border with Syria. The army also said soldiers blew up an explosives-packed car and a booby-trapped motorcycle carrying would-be suicide bombers in Ras Baalbek, preventing an attack on the troops. Lebanon's battle against ISIL comes as the group faces assaults in both neighbouring Syria and Iraq , where the government early on Sunday announced an offensive on the group's bastion of Tal Afar . Simultaneous Hezbollah offensive On Sunday, Lebanon 's National News Agency reported soldiers used heavy artillery and rockets against ISIL positions in Jurud Ras Baalbek. At least 20 ISIL fighters have been killed in clashes since the army unleashed its operation on Saturday, and 10 soldiers wounded, military spokesman Brigadier General Nazih Jreij said. He said on the first day of the offensive that the army had captured around 30sq km of territory. The army says around 600 ISIL fighters were deployed in the Jurud Ras Baalbek and Jurud al-Qaa areas and controlled around 120sq km of territory before the latest advances. READ MORE: Bringing facts back to Lebanon's refugee conversation The offensive comes after Lebanon's powerful Shia group Hezbollah waged a six-day assault against ISIL and al-Qaeda 's former affiliate in the Jurud Arsal area. The operation ended with a ceasefire that saw around 8,000 refugees and fighters transported to a rebel-held area of northwestern Syria in return for the release of five captured Hezbollah fighters. On Saturday, Hezbollah said it launched an operation against ISIL from the Syrian side of the border, where its fighters are battling alongside President Bashar al-Assad 's army against rebels.

On Sunday, the SITE Intelligence Group reported an ISIL claim that the group had killed "nearly 100 Lebanese soldiers and Hezbollah fighters amidst clashes in western Qalamun". Security along Lebanon's eastern border with Syria has long been a concern, and in 2014 ISIL and the al-Nusra Front group invaded the town of Arsal and kidnapped 30 Lebanese soldiers and policemen. Four were executed by their captors while a fifth died of his wounds. Sixteen were released in a prisoner swap in December 2015, but another nine soldiers are believed to remain in ISIL hands, their fate unknown. The army offensive against ISIL also comes after the group claimed several international attacks, including twin car-ramming incidents in Spain that killed 14 people. Lebanese soldiers raised the Spanish flag on a hilltop captured from ISIL on Saturday in a tribute to the victims of those attacks, the army said.

Bus drivers wait for those leaving Arsal to arrive [Ali Hashisho/Reuters] Buses carrying thousands of Syrian refugees and rebel fighters have begun leaving the Lebanese territory of Arsal for Syria , according to the Hezbollah-owned al-Manar TV station. The evacuation on Monday is part of a deal between rebels and Hezbollah , which ensures the safe passage of refugees and the fighters themselves. Previous deals have seen refugees head to rebel held territory but on Friday, the Lebanese security official overseeing the arrangements, General Abbas Ibrahim, said that a group of civilians would go to Assal al-Ward, an area just across the border from Arsal and held by the Syrian government.

A military media unit run by Hezbollah last week said they would go to the rebel-held town of al-Ruhaiba in the Eastern Qalamoun region, the Reuters news agency reported. Some 300 rebels from a group called Saraya Ahl al-Sham - which is loyal to the Free Syrian Army - as well as about 3,000 refugees are included in the deal that followed an assault by the Lebanese Shia group on rebel positions in Arsal, last month. Hezbollah began its operation to retake parts of Arsal from Syrian rebels groups late in July with help from Syrian government warplanes. The Islamic State of Iraq and Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) group still holds an enclave straddling the border near the town of Arsal. Hezbollah and the Lebanese army are set to launch an offensive to expel ISIL from the area, but no date has been set so far. Nearly 1.5 million refugees have poured into Lebanon , and they now make up around a quarter of the country's population. Most languish in severe poverty, and several thousand live in makeshift camps east of Arsal. The multi-sided Syrian conflict has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven at least 11 million from their homes - about half of Syria's prewar population.

Fighting flared up in July when Hezbollah launched an operation to capture the area from Syrian armed groups. Security sources say that about 1,000 Jabhat Fateh al-Sham fighters are among those who left the area for Idlib aboard dozens of buses. Al Jazeera's Imtiaz Tyab, reporting from Beirut, said the events were a culmination of a very complex deal. "The deal involved a number of phases, which included the exchange of the remains of the fighters on each side, and this very large evacuation and prisoner release," he said. However, in an interview to Al Jadeed, a Lebanon-based TV station seen as close to the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , a Lebanese General Security official estimated the number of fighters to be much lower. "What we know is 120 fighters," Major-General Abbas Ibrahim said. Refugee crisis Arsal and its neighbouring areas are home to around 100,000 Syrian refugees, who have fled fighting between rebel and government forces. The war began when government troops opened fire on pro-democracy protesters in early 2011 but quickly turned into an armed conflict involving dozens of armed groups, and later foreign forces. Hezbollah entered the conflict in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and has taken part in offensives on both sides of the border.

The conflict has resulted in one of the most severe refugee crises since World War II with nearly five million people fleeing the country since 2011, according to the UNHCR .

Buses carrying Syrians have begun leaving refugee camps in the Lebanese border area of Jroud Arsal under a truce deal between Lebanon's Hezbollah and Syrian Jabhat Fateh al-Sham fighters. Thousands of Syrians, including fighters, their families and refugees, are to leave the border zone and head for Syria's Idlib province under the agreement. The Lebanese Al Manar television station said on Wednesday that 26 buses crossed further northeast from the Arsal area to Wadi Hmeid, in the direction of the Syrian border. Al Jazeera's Imtiaz Tyab, reporting from Labweh, said t he logistics of the long convoy would be challenging. " The Lebanese Red Cross will escort this convoy to the border with Syria," he said. "They will then be met by the Syrian Red Crescent, which will escort the convoy to Idlib province, a rebel-held area. "That is where these refugees, these fighters and their families will be going, but we understand this could take many many hours." Nearly 7,000 Syrians are expected to leave the area under the ceasefire deal, according to Hezbollah-run news media outlets. The deal also included the release of Hezbollah fighters by Jabhat Fateh al-Sham , formerly known as al-Nusra Front, which took place overnight. The ceasefire took effect last week, just days after Hezbollah and the Syrian army launched an offensive to drive Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and other armed groups from their last foothold along the Syria-Lebanon border.

Hezbollah said in a statement on Saturday that out of 17 buses full of hundreds of lightly armed ISIL fighters and their families only six remained in government-held territory under the protection of the Syrian state and Hezbollah. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5540801964001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5540801964001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: Syrian refugees and fighters begin leaving Lebanon border area (2:12) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The buses, which left ISIL's enclave near Syria's border with Lebanon on Monday, were in danger from US-led coalition air raids before reaching their destination of Deir Az Zor's Al-Bukamal city, near the Iraqi border. "The Syrian state and Hezbollah have fulfilled their obligations to transfer buses out of the area of Syrian government control without exposing them," Hezbollah's statement said. Rami Abdurrahman, head of the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said dozens of fighters and civilians left the buses and drove into ISIL-held parts of Deir Az Zor in 12 civilian vehicles. Omar Abu Laila, a member of the DeirEzzor 24 activist group, who currently lives in Europe , gave an account similar to that of Abdurrahman. Remaining buses Hezbollah said there were old people, casualties, and pregnant women in the remaining six buses stranded outside Syrian government control in the desert and called on the international community to step in to prevent them coming to harm. "The so-called international community and international institutions should intervene to prevent the occurrence of an ugly massacre," said the statement. The US-led coalition vowed to continue monitoring the convoy and disrupt any effort it makes to cross into ISIL territory, but said it would not bomb it directly because it contains civilian family members of the fighters. On Wednesday, the coalition said its jets cratered a road and destroyed a bridge to stop the convoy progressing, and bombed ISIL comrades coming the other way to meet it. READ MORE: US-led air attacks block ISIL evacuation deal A commander in the pro-Assad military alliance said earlier on Saturday that Hezbollah and the Syrian army changed the route of the convoy from Humeima, a hamlet deep in the southeast desert, to a location further north, but coalition jets again struck near that route. On Friday, coalition jets made mock air raids over the convoy, the commander added. "It caused panic among the Daeshis. The militants are scared the convoy will be bombarded as soon as it enters Deir Az Zor," the commander said, using a plural form of the Arabic acronym for ISIL to refer to its fighters. Insult to the Iraqi people Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has described the evacuation deal between ISIL and the Syrian government brokered by Hezbollah as "unacceptable" and an "insult to the Iraqi people". In Lebanon, some criticised it for allowing fighters suspected of killing Lebanese citizens to escape on "airconditioned buses". Deir Az Zor in Syria's east is one of ISIL's last remaining strongholds, where it holds most of the province and parts of its capital of the same name.

Iran paper reads ''Crazy Trump and logical JCPOA" [STR/AFP/Getty Images] The US House of Representatives have backed new sanctions on Lebanon's Hezbollah militia, as the group tries to recover from its costly involvement in Syria . Backed by Iran , Hezbollah has been fighting on the side of the Syrian regime. The move against an ally of Iran came as part of a US effort to hit at Tehran without immediately moving to undermine an international nuclear agreement. Three Hezbollah-related measures passed, without opposition, by voice vote. On Thursday, the House will vote on another bill calling for additional sanctions on Iran related to its ballistic missiles programme. President Donald Trump said on October 13 he would not certify that Iran is complying with an international agreement on its nuclear programme, and threatened that he might ultimately terminate the accord. Trump's action opened a 60-day window for Congress to act to reimpose sanctions on Iran's nuclear programme that were lifted under the agreement, but there has been no move to do so in the House or Senate. Aides said that, for now, House legislators are focusing on clamping down on Iran in other ways, such as the Hezbollah and missile-related sanctions. The first of the Hezbollah-related measures passed on Wednesday would impose new sanctions on any entities found to support the group, such as by providing weapons to Hezbollah. The second imposed sanctions on Iran and Hezbollah for allegedly using civilians as human shields. The third was a resolution urging the European Union to designate Hezbollah as a "terrorist" organisation. The US named Hezbollah as a foreign "terrorist" organisation in 1997. Earlier this month, Trump administration offered to pay a multimillion-dollar reward for information leading to the arrest of two of Hezbollah officials, Talal Hamiyah and Fuad Shukr. "These critical measures will impose new sanctions to crack down on Hezbollah's financing, and hold it accountable for its acts of death and destruction," said Representative Ed Royce, chairperson of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. However, winning international support for an intensified campaign against Hezbollah could prove difficult. The powerful Shia organisation is part of Lebanon 's fragile coalition government and commands enormous support for the social services it provides. Hezbollah reached peak popularity in 2006 amid regional anti-Israel sentiment. Since its association with the Assad regime in Syria, Arab countries have joined a chorus of disapproval against Hezbollah. The group has seen its resources drained by Syria's war , and is in need of a new raison d'etre to bolster their costly involvement.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah also criticised Saudi Arabia in his speech [File: Aziz Taher/Reuters] Lebanese group Hezbollah says the Iraqi Kurdish secession vote marked a first step towards the partition of the Middle East , warning it would lead to "internal wars" and must be opposed.

"It will open the door to partition, partition, partition," Nasrallah said. "Partition means taking the region to internal wars whose end and timeframe is known only to God." Nasrallah noted his group's enemy Israel had come out in support of Kurdish statehood and described the referendum as part of an American-Israeli plot to carve up the region. READ MORE: Turkey warns of armed action over Kurdish referendum The United States came out in opposition to the vote, along with major European states and neighbouring countries Turkey and Iran. The government of Syria , where Kurdish groups have established autonomous regions, also opposed the referendum. "Israel had no part in the Kurdish referendum, aside from the deep, natural sympathy over many years for the Kurdish people and their aspiration," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday during a cabinet meeting. Nasrallah said divisions would also reach other countries in the region including Saudi Arabia , a country he harshly criticised in his speech. Hezbollah, a political and military movement, is a major player in the Syrian conflict, where it has deployed thousands of fighters in support of President Bashar al-Assad . Hezbollah fighters are currently fighting along with other Iran-backed militias and the Syrian army against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) fighters in eastern Syria . "Daesh is at its end. It is a matter of time in Iraq and Syria," Nasrallah said, using an Arabic acronym for ISIL. He said counterattacks mounted by the group in eastern Syria in the last two days were expected as it was besieged, adding ISIL was "incapable of recovering ground".

Amid heavy fighting between ISIL and government forces, hospitals and schools across Mosul were severely damaged, debilitating the city and leaving employees with no future [John Beck/Al Jazeera] Mosul, Iraq - Doctor Omar was on duty in Mosul 's eastern al-Khansa hospital when the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) stormed the city in early June 2014. The slim 37-year-old saw the flames in the distance as fighters torched government offices and heard confused reports from friends and relatives of masked gunmen on the streets. Colleagues began to panic, to talk of leaving town. But Omar, who asked not to be referred to by his full name for fear of retaliation, had patients to treat, so he continued his rounds of the paediatrics department. The Iraqi troops and police deployed in the city collapsed almost immediately and many of Mosul's residents awoke to find themselves under ISIL's control. Omar carried on working, filling gaps in the rota where other staff had fled. A few days later, a local man called the hospital. He told them that he was with ISIL and had removed local health ministry officials. From now on, he added, the doctors answered to him. Across Mosul's largely shuttered public service buildings, the same process repeated itself, more than a dozen civil servants told Al Jazeera. The group installed their own people at the top, then located street cleaners, electricity department personnel or teachers and told them they would be killed if they did not come back to work. This was a systematic process designed to give ISIL's self-declared caliphate the trappings of nationhood beyond sheer military might. Government workers were made often-unwilling participants in ISIL's so-called Islamic State. They helped the group maintain a hold on Iraq's second city that was finally ended this month by what US military commanders have described as the largest urban military operation since WWII . READ MORE: What will post-ISIL Mosul look like? Some employees did not have to be threatened. To Omar's surprise, three al-Khansa staff sided with the new rulers. He recalled seeing one, a nurse named Mohammed, in the corridor. The man was burlier and had grown a long beard, so Omar tried unsuccessfully to avoid his gaze. "He said 'Hello doctor; I joined ISIS.' I didn't know what to say." The government in Baghdad continued to pay salaries to state workers - even as security forces battled the fighters elsewhere - couriering vast sums of cash into the city. Political leaders hoped this would prevent civilian suffering. But it also ensured that institutions continued to function under ISIL rule and allowed the group to skim funds for themselves, adding to substantial income from oil and taxation. Salam Hospital in Mosul was almost completely destroyed in heavy fighting between ISIL and government forces [John Beck/Al Jazeera] Speaking at his east Mosul home, Omar explained that initially "ISIL was lenient." They even let him travel to Jordan in November 2014 to sit postgraduate clinical exams, though they warned that if he did not return within 30 days, his family home would be confiscated. The journey involved a six-hour taxi ride and a three-mile walk in knee-deep mud. But leaving was like going "from hell to heaven", he said while showing a picture of himself smiling on the morning of his exam and another of him and his friends relaxing by the Dead Sea. A few days later he was back in Mosul. Schools had reopened for the fall term by then, and ISIL had mandated changes in line with its strict interpretation of Islamic law, according to a 46-year-old primary school teacher who asked to go by the pseudonym Abu Ahmed. Discussion of the Iraqi government and its borders was banned along with pro-science slogans. Photographs of the opposite gender were to be censored from textbooks - teachers instructed students to go through and scribble them out themselves - hair styling was prohibited, and sports jerseys were only allowed if the badges were ripped off. Despite ISIL's attempt to portray Mosul as an Islamic utopia, services were distributed in an ever more unequal manner. Two squat, short-haired men who worked with the electricity department, said they and colleagues were instructed to concentrate on supplying power to ISIL fighters at all times. The rest of the city had six hours a day or less. "Electricity was 24/7 for ISIL fighters and ISIL bases, and the foreign fighters were most important," one said, referring to members who had come from outside Iraq . Mosul residents said repeatedly that while life under ISIL was difficult, the city was unusually clean. This was thanks to the toil of street sweepers forced to work harder than ever. After a day's work in a battle-damaged eastern district, 21-year-old Hatim Jassim described how ISIL had increased their shifts by two hours and cancelled their day off. Here too, the fighters benefited disproportionately. "The places that their bosses lived had to be cleaned every day," Jassim said, adding that ISIL fighters also confiscated their bright orange overalls. Jassim and his colleagues could not understand why until they saw them on victims in one of ISIL's notorious execution videos. READ MORE: Mosul in ruins: 'I see only despair around us' By the following year, ISIL had consolidated its hold on the city, the jewel in over 38,000 square miles of territory. As they did, the coalition of forces assembled by the US in 2014 to battle the group began to increase support operations, helping Iraqi and Kurdish forces to claw back ground. Inside Mosul, conditions became stricter. Smoking was prohibited, mobile phones were confiscated along with satellite dishes and televisions. Failure to comply meant fines, jail, or physical punishment, with much of the cruellest treatment meted out by foreign fighters. At the hospital, Omar treated the children of fighters from countries that ranged from China , Somalia and Tunisia to the United States and Brazil . The parents were often angry or anxious, and he was terrified of what they might do if something went wrong. In July 2015, Baghdad stopped paying government salaries. ISIL began to issue public workers meagre wages of around $70 a month - with the additional incentive of death for anyone who refused. When school terms started, ISIL fighters collected textbooks and burned them, then distributed CDs of replacements to be printed off at the students' expense. Abu Ahmed showed a set; reams of stapled A4 sheets marked with faded ink. The changes were vast this time. History related only to ISIL and its precursor organisations, geography became the borders of ISIL territory. Even maths examples were changed to include guns and bullets. "They said not to mention Pythagoras's name because he's a disbeliever," Abu Ahmed said with an incredulous laugh. Asked if he felt bad for perpetuating ISIL ideology, the huge, heavy jowled teacher nodded vehemently. "A child's mind is just like wheat before you make bread, you can do whatever you want." Mosul University was severely damaged in heavy fighting and is now manned by security forces after the fall of ISIL [John Beck/Al Jazeera] But many of his students were the children of fighters, and he feared them, especially after a colleague was lashed for ignoring the new curriculum. "Of course, I was scared… I was worried that they might lie about me if they disliked me, I'd change my behaviour around the children in case they said anything [to their parents]." Instead, he began to use the pretext of regular family gatherings to teach young relatives maths, reading, and even basic science. He swore the children to absolute secrecy every class, well aware of the likely punishment if he was caught. Meanwhile, ISIL was discovering that Mosul would not run on fear alone. The electricity workers were short on materials, so ISIL fighters looted supplies from abandoned Christian towns outside the city. In some cases, they forced other city employees to do the labour. "We became thieves," Jassim, the young street cleaner said. "They'd order us to 'clean' a district, but it wouldn't be cleaning, it would be stealing." The group became more anxious about controlling these workers, recruiting informants to report infractions like smoking or watching television and cruelly punishing disobedience. One day in 2015, an 18-year-old street cleaner asked his ISIL supervisors for time off after his father died, Jassim said. But his request was turned down and in an ensuing argument one of the fighters - another young man from Mosul - shot him dead. READ MORE: ISIL families lament harsh treatment in Iraq By mid-2016, ISIL had little more than fear to fall back on. Iraqi and Kurdish security forces encircled Mosul and conditions inside the city worsened, with food prices soaring. Doctors in al-Khansa began to see more and more preventable diseases, as well as cases of malnutrition. When the offensive finally began in October, ISIL fighters would burst into the hospital with wounded comrades and demand they be treated before civilians. Their rules became stricter still and enforcement unreasoning. Omar remembers an ISIL fighter screaming at a mother who lifted her niqab to comfort a child who was having an IV drip inserted. The army reached Omar's northeastern district in November 2016 and announced an all clear after six days of fighting. The doctor walked outside hesitantly and was immediately shot in the thigh. It was a flesh wound, but there were was no medical facility nearby, so he took a scalpel, dug out bullet fragments without anaesthetic then sutured his leg back up. After Mosul was retaken from ISIL control, many hospital clinics were abandoned [John Beck/Al Jazeera] A week later, he limped to the primary healthcare facility two kilometres away and began to work again. The east of Mosul was declared officially retaken in January as devastating fighting continued on the other side of the Tigris. Reconstruction began soon after, and trucks laden with building materials and food soon tailed back at checkpoints into the city each morning But many state workers said they had still not been paid. At a number of hospitals, many of which are still badly damaged, doctors complained they only received supplies from NGOs, while volunteer medics said it felt as if their government had abandoned them. Some schools, meanwhile, were still rubble and without books and materials, teachers worried about the coming fall term. Abu Ahmed and his colleagues staged campaigns on social media and petitioned local officials for help. But back home on his day off, Omar was optimistic. "We are amazed at ourselves," he said with a smile. "We withstood ISIL; we can withstand this."

The body of a man blindfolded and with his hands bound on a roadside south of Mosul, Iraq May 15, 2017 [Reuters/Danish Siddiqui] There have been no surprises in Mosul. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) was roundly defeated, and the combined forces of the Iraqi security services are victorious. In eastern Mosul , which was liberated months before the rest of the city, Iraqis are seeking to return to normality as fast as possible, by reopening their businesses, resuming classes and exams, organising cultural activities, rebuilding libraries and engaging in reconciliation initiatives . In case there was still any doubt, Iraqi society is once again proving just how resilient it is.

(24:36) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Sadly, that is not where the story ends. As if reading from a script, a stream of soldiers, federal police officers and popular mobilisation fighters have engaged in mass arrests, torture, and summary executions of suspected ISIL fighters. Increasingly, the perpetrators record every detail of their gruesome acts and post them on social media for all to see, including videos in which captives are thrown from the top of buildings and showered with bullets after they land on the riverbank. Just as seriously, individuals who are thought to be related to ISIL fighters, colloquially referred to as "ISIL families", are imprisoned in horrific conditions, many of them left without sustenance and medical care. For the sake of clarity, the perpetrators include people of all faiths and races and are members of almost every security agency imaginable. In fact, just about the only security force that has not been accused of human rights abuses is the Counter Terrorism Service, which has been leading the fight against ISIL since 2014 (because the CTS is not politicised , it has not received anywhere near as much attention as other groups, such as the Popular Mobilisation Forces and the Peshmerga ). Its commander, Lieutenant Abdel Ghani al-Saadi, is rumoured to have unsuccessfully challenged his counterparts from other agencies, as he learned of the abuse that was taking place, before storming out of the city. Iraqi forces arrest a person suspected of belonging to Islamic State militants in western Mosul, Iraq, February 26, 2017. [Reuters/Alaa Al-Marjani/] Senior interior ministry officials have noted that torture and unlawful killings will be investigated and prosecuted in all cases, but it is common knowledge that prosecutors and judges are largely powerless to move against the security forces, despite a few token arrests. In fact, some of the worst perpetrators of abuse have argued that courts are so corrupt that any ISIL fighter who is arrested could bribe their way out of prison. Also predictable is that commentators have reacted according to their political colouring. Sectarian Sunni politicians, who have barely raised a whimper to condemn the unrelenting wave of terrorist attacks that have targeted Baghdad since 2003, rediscovered their humanity when the images from Mosul were circulated online. Meanwhile, many pro-government Iraqis and foreigners have been busy trying to brush the abuse aside as an inevitable byproduct of the conflict and as altogether unimportant given the context. Commentators have also noted that Iraqis largely do not care about this type of abuse, and any attempt to disseminate information on what happened is motivated by an attempt to sow discord in Iraq.

Even so, the attempts to minimise what has taken place, the explanations that have been offered and the conclusions that have been reached are both misplaced and very dangerous. Apart from the fact that many of the victims are probably innocent of any criminal behaviour, and apart from the obvious inhumanity of the way that they were treated, the fact is that torture and summary executions are totally prohibited under international and Iraqi law. In that context, the failure to prosecute the perpetrators does not just mean that criminal elements are allowed to proceed with their lives unpunished. It also sends a very clear message to all security services that they can act with impunity in a city where they already have an inflated sense of their own power. It is precisely that sense of lawlessness that was so damaging before 2014 and which will create fear among ordinary people. The tragedy is that news of the abuse has already travelled far and wide, which has lessened the service of those soldiers, police officers and others who served with distinction and professionalism. More importantly, it betrays the sacrifice of the very many martyrs who gave their lives in liberating Mosul, Tikrit and other parts of Iraq from ISIL occupation. And as acts of brutality and random arrests continue to go unpunished, broad segments of the population will be unable to distinguish between rogue elements within the security services and those that are worthy of trust. They will learn to fear the same security force which liberated them, which is precisely the type of relationship that ISIL and other terrorist groups seek to exploit. Many of us have been warning that the Iraqi state will need to engage in deep reform to prevent the re-emergence of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. Some of these reforms are obvious and not hard to achieve, including improving the implementation of laws that are already on the books and designed to prevent abuse by criminal elements within the security services. It seems that that advice is going unheeded and that the Iraqi state is once again contributing to what will likely be more instability and suffering. If that does transpire, then it should also not come as a surprise. Zaid al-Ali is an Iraqi lawyer.

ISIL has claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing and a gun attack on the Iraqi embassy in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul late last month [Mohammed Ismail/Reuters] After losing Mosul and vast territories in Iraq and Syria , the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) is probably hoping to move to Afghanistan . It has substantially increased its attacks in the past two years and recruited hundreds of additional supporters. It is targeting mainly the Shias and the Hazara minority and in parts joining forces with the Taliban thereby changing the dynamics of the war in Afghanistan. By doing so, it is provoking Iran and possibly Russia to get involved. The Persian-speaking Shia Hazara, estimated to make up about nine percent of Afghanistan's population, have close ties to Iran. ISIL (also known as ISIS) could take advantage of another "lost" American war and another failing state, as it did in Iraq. Afghanistan's complex set of security and political problems are providing the armed group the chaos conditions that it needs to prosper.

(25:15) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY In its latest attack on a village in the northern province of Sar-e Pul, described as a war crime by the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, government officials said ISIL joined forces with the Taliban in the brutal killing of more than 50 civilians, mainly Shia Hazaras. Only one week earlier the twin attacks claimed by ISIL on the Iraqi embassy in Kabul and the Shia mosque in the western city of Herat , with over 120 casualties, appeared carefully chosen to take revenge against both Iraqi and Iranian forces for the loss of its stronghold, Mosul. These were the tail end of six attacks this year targeting Shia mosques. Four of the attacks occurred in Herat and ISIL claimed responsibility for two. In 2016, there were four separate attacks against Shia mosques and ISIL claimed responsibility for two. In July last year, ISIL's twin explosions tore through a demonstration by the Shia Hazara minority in Kabul killing at least 80 people and wounding more than 230. READ MORE: Who are the Hazaras? ISIL seems intentionally to target Iran's interests in Afghanistan: Shia mosques, the Hazara minority, and the city of Herat -with a large population of Tajiks- have all received the bulk of Iran's financial and political support. Iran has spent millions of dollars in aid and reconstruction projects building a 400km highway and a major railway linking Herat to Iran's Khorasan province. Most of the work has been carried out by Khatam ul Anbya Construction which is the economic arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC). These transport links have greatly enhanced trade, especially for Iran. Given his strong partnership with the US, President Ghani would never willingly invite Russia or Iran for military cooperation as, for example, Iraq and Syria did. Herat is located at the heart of the 1,000km border between the two countries, which share a rich historical and literary heritage. Iran values this heritage beyond its push to influence politics in Afghanistan. Moreover, Iran regards itself as the custodian of Shia rights around the world, and would not take ISIL attacks lightly especially since they follow the twin attacks in Iran two months ago after which Iran arrested several suspected ISIL operatives. Last week, Iran announced that it arrested further 27 suspected ISIL members . Iran's strong condemnation of ISIL attacks in Afghanistan came with an offer of "collective security guarantee". The national security chief, Ali Shamkhani, said Tehran would "expand regional cooperation especially with the Afghan government to jointly confront this dangerous threat". In April , when Shamkhani met the Afghan national security adviser, Hanif Atmar, he condemned "the attempts by certain regional states" to upset security in Afghanistan "as part of a broader scheme to dispatch the defeated terrorists from Iraq and Syria to Afghanistan". His reference can only be to Saudi Arabia , which as a staunch ally of Pakistan, has reportedly been funding Taliban through "private or covert channels". So, Iran regards these advances in the context of the Iran-Saudi regional rivalries and Sunni advances against Shias, while rejecting reports that it is funding the Taliban. Equally concerned is Russia about the 2,000km border Central Asian republics have with Afghanistan. Russia is aware that since its military operations in Syria, thousands of ISIL fighters are regrouping in Afghanistan to take revenge. According to intelligence by the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), ISIL's activity in Afghanistan has grown by one-third this year compared with 2016, with around 1,000 Central Asian operatives working along the border areas. OPINION: ISIL won't get very far in Afghanistan - for now In February, the Russian Foreign Ministry expressed the necessity of strengthening "military-technical cooperation with Kabul". Zamir Kabulov, the Russian president's special envoy to Afghanistan warned that if the situation on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan deteriorates "capabilities of the CSTO may be used under a due appeal of the Tajik side". In April, Russia proposed an international conference on Afghanistan inviting all neighbours including Iran, Pakistan and India but US government did not attend citing Russian military assistance to Taliban. Russia rejected the claim. The meeting in mid-April between the US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, for improving mutual military understanding also came to nothing after the US imposed sanctions on Russia. Given his strong partnership with the US, President Ghani would never willingly invite Russia or Iran for military cooperation as, for example, Iraq and Syria did. Yet, he is aware that the US administration is paralysed by its own internal squabbles over Afghanistan. Moreover, President Ghani is himself facing arguably the most difficult time of his leadership with internal challenges from three former strongmen demanding security reforms, his own National Unity Government in disarray, and civil society accusing him of inaction. That is to say nothing of the ongoing corruption, unemployment , war fatigue, and a nation traumatised by the highest ever number of civilian casualties. President Ghani's legitimacy has not as yet been eroded. Nevertheless, the danger signs are there of a failing or fragile state that would provide suitable ground for the regrouping of ISIL and Taliban.

The more likely scenario is that more Taliban commanders would follow the example of Sher Mohammad Ghazanfar in Sar-e Pul, and pledge allegiance to ISIL. "There are no strict ideological distinctions between them so they build bridges when it helps them both," said one Afghan security source who cited three other joint operations. The US and NATO chief command, General John W Nicholson warned Pentagon in December that political instability in Afghanistan would have two outcomes: the convergence of terrorist groups in Afghanistan, and the malign influence of Pakistan , Iran and Russia. The first outcome is already unfolding: Taliban controls more than one-third of Afghanistan and is seriously challenging another third. ISIL seems increasingly unstoppable. There are no plausible indications that either the Afghan or the international forces in their present state can stop their convergence in Afghanistan . That leaves the second Nicholson outcome; an outcome that may complicate matters in Afghanistan to the point of no return. That is why Afghanistan must choose a third option and that is the option of leaving open the channels of diplomatic and military consultations with Russia and Iran to avoid their retaliatory covert action.

Artifacts recovered from ISIL fighters by the Iraqi security forces in 2015. The authorities said the haul was proof ISIL was funding its war by smuggling antiquities [Thaier Al-Sudani/Reuters] If you took a walk around the major museums of world capitals, the Louvre in Paris, the British Museum in London or the Metropolitan Museum in New York, you would undoubtedly encounter a vast number of ancient objects from faraway corners of the world. If you were among the truly interested, you could read the plaques affixed to the display that will tell you when the object was made and where it was found. Sometimes, you may even find a small story about the object, what it signified to those who lived long ago. What the plaques almost never reveal is the "provenance" of the object, the record of origin that not only certifies authenticity, but also who owned it, who sold it and how it got from that faraway place to the museum shelf. At most, the names of donors who have loaned or gifted the object to the museum's collection are mentioned, a public "thank you" of sorts to the very generous and wealthy. How they got the object is, again, assumed to be nobody's business.

It is just these omitted or secret details of provenance that enable the billion-dollar illicit trade in antiquities to continue and thrive. Smugglers steal and sell, capitalising on moments of conflict, war and even natural disaster. Even extremist groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) and the Taliban have also been known to sell antiquities to fill their own coffers. Art dealers with contacts in war torn regions buy and hoard, laying in wait for the most profitable time to sell. If the dealer has a history of selling authentic pieces, private collectors and even museums will subsequently gobble up the goods. As the recent debacle over the US retailer Hobby Lobby's purchase of 5,500 antiquities smuggled out of Iraq illustrates, legal advice that questions the origins of the goods is often ignored. The smuggling, undertaken over many years of shipments, was only discovered after US customs agents happened upon it after opening up a shipment which was supposed to contain garden ornaments. Many other shipments are never discovered and their origins remain unquestioned even as thousands of people gape at them on museum shelves. READ MORE: Hobby Lobby exposes UAE-Israel antiquities trade It was not meant to be this way. In 1970, the UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property was passed , making it the first international instrument dedicated to the fight against illicit trafficking of cultural property. Its passage attempted to create an umbrella legal instrument under which the varying laws of the 100 or so signatory nations could be gathered. More explicitly, it sought to curtail the smuggling and trade in illicit antiquities. As Jason Felch and Ralph Frammolino say in their book "Chasing Aphrodite: The Hunt for Looted Antiquities in the World's Richest Museum", the UNESCO convention reflected a "a consensus that the antiquity's value lies not just in its intrinsic beauty but also in its archaeological context - where it is found and how it is related to those surroundings". None of its instruments, however, required museums to publicly reveal the provenance of objects in their collection. It is perhaps for just that reason that the convention has had limited success, been unable to stop the trade in smuggled and stolen artifacts that was envisaged at its passing. In recent days, the looting of antiquities from Iraq and Syria has introduced thousands of stolen objects into the market. Sales of these goods are said to be funding jihadists in Europe and even ISIL itself . Stealing the Dancing Shiva One case that illustrates just how all the secret stealing and smuggling and procuring happens is that of the Dancing Shiva, a 900-year-old bronze statue, procured in 2008 by the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra. In March 2014, almost six years after buying it, the gallery announced that it would be returning the statue. An investigation by Indian authorities has alleged that the statue was stolen from a temple in Tamil Nadu. New York-based art dealer Subhash Kapoor then took possession of it and sold it to the Australian museum . Museums fight against having to reveal the provenance of objects precisely because they know that many of the objects in their vast collections have illicit histories behind them. On official documents, Kapoor held that the statue had left India in 1970. The National Gallery looked at the documents, but never bothered to call or contact the people that Kapoor claimed to have got it from. Instead, they handed over a whopping $5.6m. They were not alone. With no legal requirement to make provenance records public, museums in New South Wales, Chicago, Ohio, and New York all bought antiquities from Kapoor. Subhash Kapoor's operation was vast, spanning many years and involving thousands of objects, mostly from South Asia. He may not have been caught if Indian authorities, who had been investigating him since 2009, had not tipped off US authorities to seize a shipment coming their way. It was sent in the name of a front company called Nimbus Import Exports and labelled "marble garden table sets". Inside were over a thousand kilogrammes of stolen antiquities worth $100m. The shipment was seized and in 2011, Kapoor himself was arrested at Frankfurt Airport and extradited to India to face trial. When US authorities raided his gallery "Art of the Past" and storerooms in New York, they found over 2500 objects collectively worth $107.9m. It was only following these seizures and the charges against Kapoor that the museums which had purchased objects from him realised that they would have to return these objects. The Australian National Gallery had to return the Dancing Shiva and the Toledo Museum of Art had to return a 1,000-year-old bronze statue of the Hindu god Ganesha. OPINION: The blood antiquities funding ISIL The seizure of Iraqi artifacts in the Hobby Lobby case and the Kapoor case reveal how prevalent antiquities smuggling is. ISIL looted the ancient Assyrian site of Nineveh and the Mosul museum in 2015 . In 2016, the Palace of Sennacherib was dismantled and the Roman theatre in Palmyra was destroyed.

These museums will undertake perfunctory investigations and hand over the cash, eager to display the items in their galleries. Museums fight against having to reveal the provenance of objects precisely because they know that many of the objects in their vast collections have illicit histories behind them. This secrecy, accepted as a norm in the world of art and antiquities, has, of course, enabled the world's large museums to build up enormous collections. The plunder of the colonial era continues - now with looted objects from the world's poor or war-ravaged countries. The story of these antiquities must go beyond when and where they were found. Information should be made public about how artefacts were bought and sold, and if smuggling and subterfuge paved their paths to the shelves of faraway Western museums. It is that last story of procurement and provenance, omitted and untold, that continues to permit plunder.

Sisi's move comes shortly after a deadly ambush on security forces in the western desert [Thibault Camus/AFP Photo] Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has replaced senior security officials in the wake of an ambush that left 55 soldiers dead in the Western Desert. The reshuffle on Saturday saw 11 security officials, including the head of the National Security Agency (NSA), lose their jobs or become assigned to other positions, according to Egyptian state media. General Mahmoud Shaarawy, the former head of the NSA, was assigned to handle port security and replaced by General Mahmoud Tawfiq, the Ahram newspaper reported. {articleGUID} Sisi followed the shake-up with a meeting of his top security officials, in which he promised to tighten security and pursue the armed groups responsible for last week's attack. At least 55 members of the security forces were killed during an ambush near the Bahariya Oasis in Egypt's Western Desert, about 180 miles southwest of the capital Cairo. The attack was one of the deadliest on security forces in recent years, and came just over a month after a similar ambush in Sinai killed 18 soldiers . An earlier attack in July on an army checkpoint in Sinai left 26 soldiers dead, including a colonel. Both attacks were claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group, which has established a strong presence in the Sinai peninsula. However, in recent years violence has spread to the mainland, particularly in the west of the country, where Egypt shares a long and porous border with Libya , a country with a plentiful stock of weapons and fighters. ISIL is just one of the armed groups involved in armed struggle with the Egyptian state, and several more have formed in the aftermath of the 2013 coup, though little is known about them. {articleGUID} As well as security forces, attacks have also focused on Egypt's minority Coptic Christian population and Sufi Muslims in Sinai. In May at least 28 Coptic Christians were killed while travelling to a monastery in Minya province.

US Africa Command says it will continue to target 'terrorists' throughout Somalia [File: AP] The US army says it has conducted two separate air strikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) group in northeastern Somalia , killing several members of the group. Friday's attacks were in coordination with Somali government forces, the statement said. The US Africa Command (AFRICOM) said the first strike occurred at approximately midnight local Somalia time (21:00 GMT), with the second strike occurring at approximately 11am local Somalia time (08:00 GMT). "We are currently assessing the results of the strike," the statement said. Reports from Somalia suggest ISIL has been recruiting members there since it became active in the country, although the scale of its activities is far smaller than that of al-Shabab. {articleGUID} At least 350 people were killed in a truck bombing in the capital, Mogadishu, last month, in the largest attack the country has seen. ISIL captured a port town in the mountainous areas of Puntland region last month. The AFRICOM statement said that US forces will continue to cooperate with the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and Somali National Security Forces (SNSF) to target "terrorists", their training camps and safe havens throughout Somalia. From the Horn of Africa in the east to the Sahel, encompassing Central and West Africa, security forces backed by Western troops have been stepping up efforts to counter armed groups such as ISIL, Boko Haram, al-Shabab and al-Qaeda. The presidents of the Sahel countries, including Mali, Niger, Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Chad, are working on final modalities to set up a G5 Sahel force to help fight the numerous groups that are active in the region. Niger ambush Earlier this month, five Nigerien and four American soldiers were killed and others wounded in an ambush on a joint patrol in southwest Niger. The attack marked the first US combat casualties in Niger and snowballed into a major controversy in Washington over the circumstances of the deaths. The US has roughly 6,000 military personnel spread across the continent, according to AFRICOM. The stated mission of many of those troops is to support African armies, alongside allies like France, with the goal of increasing the African nations' own security capabilities and stabilisation of the region. AFRICOM began initial operations 10 years ago, in October 2007.

A woman is aided by first responders after sustaining injury on a bike path in lower Manhattan in New York [Reuters] At least eight people have been killed and 12 injured in New York City after a driver rammed into cyclists and pedestrians before being shot by police on Tuesday. Here is what we know so far: What happened in the New York City attack? At least eight people in New York City died and 12 were injured after a driver rammed into cyclists and pedestrians before being shot by police, on Tuesday. According to police officials, a 29-year-old man drove a pick-up truck into a cycle lane in Manhattan shortly after 3:00pm (19:00 GMT), subsequently hitting a number of people on the route. The driver had reached speeds of around 60mph (100km/h) before hitting a school bus. After the collision, the driver exited the vehicle brandishing two imitation guns, at which point he was shot by a police officer. Videos taken by passersby show emergency services treating those wounded with at least two people seen lying on the ground unconscious. Where did it happen? The attack happened not far from the World Trade Center. Who is Sayfullo Saipov? The New York Police Department identified the suspect in custody as 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov. Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in Tuesday's deadly truck attack, is seen in an undated handout photo [Handout/St Charles County Department of Corrections/AFP] NYPD Commissioner John Miller said that Saipov is a legal, permanent US resident, who arrived in the country from Uzbekistan in 2010. The suspect was wounded in the abdomen and transferred to a local hospital, police said. He had rented the pick-up from a Home Depot hardware store in New Jersey. On Wednesday, Saipov was charged with providing materials and resources to ISIL , as well as violence and destruction of a motor vehicle. Investigators told federal prosecutors that Saipov began planning the attack about a year ago and he wanted to "inflict the maximum damage against civilians". Investigators also said he was inspired by videos posted by ISIL. "In particular, Saipov was motivated to commit the attack after viewing a video in which [ISIL leader] Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ... questioned what Muslims in the United States and elsewhere were doing to respond to the killing of Muslims in Iraq," court documents said. The complaint also said that during Saipov's interview with police, he requested that ISIL's flag be displayed in his hospital room. Saipov appeared in court later on Wednesday in a wheelchair. He was ordered detained and did not enter a guilty plea or seek bail, according to the Associated Press. Authorities from the mayor's office to the US Department of Homeland Security swiftly branded the attack as an "act of terrorism". New York Governor Andrew Cuomo stressed that the suspect was believed to have acted alone. How many casualties? At least eight people in New York City have been killed and 12 others injured. People place candles outside the Polytechnic School during a vigil in Rosario, Argentina [AP Photo] Five of the dead were Argentine citizens: Hernan Diego Mendoza, Diego Enrique Angelini, Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, Ariel Erlij and Hernan Ferruchi. They were visiting New York as part of a group of friends celebrating the 30th anniversary of their high school graduation, the Argentina foreign ministry said. A sixth member of the group, Martin Ludovico Marro, was among those hospitalised after the attack, the ministry said in a statement. At least one Belgian and two Americans were also killed. Belgian officials said three of the injured were from Belgium . How did Trump respond? Donald Trump responded to the deadly attack in New York via Twitter , saying: "In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE USA!" In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.! — Donald J.

RenderPagesVideo('5632730904001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); The suspect in Tuesday's deadly truck ramming attack in New York City has been charged with "terrorism" related counts, federal prosecutors announced. Sayfullo Saipov allegedly drove a rented truck down a popular bicycle path, mowing down cyclists and pedestrians. Eight people were killed and 12 others injured, some remain in serious condition. According to the charge documents, filed on Wednesday, Saipov started planning the attack one year ago and was inspired by videos posted by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS). "Saipov was motivated to commit the attack after viewing a video in which [ISIL leader] Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ... questioned what Muslims in the United States and elsewhere were doing to respond to the killing of Muslims in Iraq," the complaint said. The documents added that Saipov decided to use a truck to "in order to inflict maximum damage against civilians", and that he had planned to drive to the Brooklyn Bridge "to continue to strike pedestrians ". Saipov was charged with providing materials and resources to ISIL, as well as violence and destruction of a motor vehicle. 'Follow ISIL's instructions to a T' According to police, the 29-year-old is a legal permanent US resident, who arrived in the country from Uzbekistan in 2010. Investigators who questioned Saipov told the prosecutors that Saipov requested to display the ISIL flag in his hospital room and that he said he "felt good about what he had done". {articleGUID} Earlier on Wednesday, New York Police Department Commissioner John Miller said multiple knives and two imitation pistols were found in and around the truck used in the attack. "He [Saipov] appears to have followed almost exactly to a 'T' the instructions that ISIS has put out in its social media channels before with instructions to their followers on how to carry out such an attack," Miller said. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Later on Wednesday, Saipov appeared in court in a wheelchair. He did not enter a plea or seek bail, according to the Associated Press. The attack is the deadliest to have taken place in New York City since the September 11 attacks in 2001. US President Donald Trump condemned the attack, saying the US "must not allow ISIS to return, or enter, our country". He vowed to end the Department of State 's Diversity Visa Lottery Programme, which he said Saipov entered the country through, and ordered Homeland Security to "step up [the US'] already extreme vetting programme". Both comments have been criticised by rights groups, who call them "unconstitutional". {articleGUID} Among the eight people killed were five men from Argentina who had travelled to New York with four other friends to celebrate a high school reunion. One Belgian and two Americans were also killed, police said. According to Reuters news agency, the FBI said it had located a second Uzbek man, wanted for questioning. New York City leaders said there are no viable threats against the city, and that the city's marathon on Sunday would go ahead as scheduled, but additional security measures would be put in place.

Mherlynda Obedencio's son Eugene was captured by ISIL fighters in Marawi in May [Steve Chao/Al Jazeera] "When I talked to my 13-year-old son, he told me, 'Mama, I want to go home, I want to go home'." This was one of the last times Mherlynda Obedencio heard her son's voice. Eugene was captured by ISIL fighters when they launched a deadly assault on the southern Philippines city of Marawi in May. Mherlynda's husband and two older children were also among hundreds of civilians taken hostage by armed fighters during a deadly five-month battle that left more than 1,000 people dead. ISIL's assault on Marawi caught the Philippines authorities off guard, sparking a fierce fight which left the city in ruins, as this exclusive 101 East documentary shows. This week, the Philippines government finally declared it had retaken the city, but the fate of many hostages, including Mherlynda's family, is only just becoming clear. In the final weeks of the war, the fighters released some hostages. Others escaped or were rescued by the military. When her family was first captured, Mherlynda, who was working outside Marawi when the attack took place, received regular text messages from her sons. She said they were used as "human shields" and forced to take up arms. In one message, they told her: "Mama, every civilian here was put on the front line … We were forced to fight, we were forced to hold the gun." But then the text messages stopped coming. After not hearing from her family in months, Mherlynda finally got news earlier this week. Her eldest son and daughter had been rescued, but Eugene and her husband are presumed dead. "He didn't even know how to fight, how to handle a gun," she said. The battle for Marawi was officially declared over in late October after the military killed more than 900 fighters, including the group's most senior leaders. But there are fears that fighters could be regrouping and that this is only the beginning of ISIL's push into Southeast Asia, where it wants to create a caliphate. The Marawi siege signaled that the group had the means to launch a bloody, sustained attack in the region. The fighters, an alliance of local groups like the Maute who have pledged allegiance to ISIL, held off the military using tactics more commonly seen in places like Syria and Iraq. Snipers lurking in abandoned buildings and thousands of hidden improvised explosives impeded attempts to retake the city. As news spread that fighters were beheading civilians and Philippine forces bombed the city, about 300,000 residents fled. Mherlynda, who is yet to be reunited with her surviving children, has been staying at one of the temporary shelters set up outside Marawi for evacuees. It's not yet clear when they may be able to return to what's left of their homes. Government officials estimate it will cost more than $1bn to rebuild the city and that it could take years. Some locals say that if the government fails to rebuild Marawi, it could become a fertile recruiting ground for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, ISIL (also known as ISIS). "If the government fails to support us, to rebuild the city, this will produce hundreds of terrorists," says Agakhan Sharief, a local Muslim leader.

There was nothing new in it - the Syrian government was again sending intimidating text messages, there were loudspeaker announcements and leaflets were being dropped in the days building up to it. But there was something more sinister in this latest chapter of psychological warfare. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5237399674001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5237399674001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > East Aleppo struggles to bury the dead PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The boast of an all-out assault felt more confident, more chilling for many in besieged Aleppo. Living under siege, they were already surviving on crumbs and facing a reduced number of attacks in the three weeks building up to the offensive. Some of the leaflets read: "This is your last hope ... Save yourselves. If you do not leave these areas urgently, you will be annihilated." They ended by saying: "You know that everyone has given up on you. They left you alone to face your doom and nobody will give you any help". And then it began. A relentless campaign of air raids, followed by helicopters dropping crude barrel bombs – just above the range of the rebels’ most powerful guns. And when they stopped, a barrage of artillery shells followed. Social media was flooded with crying fathers, scared children, helpless mothers - the sanitised version of the horrible reality of dozens of bodies being collected in pieces. READ MORE: Syria's army tightens grip on key Aleppo district The strategy was simple: Use the blunt end of brute force at the most vulnerable choke points. It's effective, especially when the objective is territorial gain regardless of civilian casualties. From the start, the videos shared by activists and the White Helmets made it clear that it was a bloodbath where nothing and no one was safe. The global silence was felt by the people after videos of children being pulled from the rubble, the lifeless infants being carried to shallow graves by only the closest members of the family (because funerals attract air strikes as well), were shared.

And then the second phase kicked in. The bombardment wasn't limited to the frontlines. The next target were those trying to maintain a semblance of life under siege - medics and rescuers. One after another the hospitals were taken out, ambulance and white helmets centres were hit. A calculated assault to kill their hope. United Nations humanitarian chief Stephen O’Brien put it best: " The tactics are as obvious as they are unconscionable. Make life intolerable; make death likely. Push people from starvation to despair to surrender. Push people to leave on green buses." Yet the most powerful, the most rich and the most influential could not stop the killing of civilians that we have watched in slow motion, unfolding in front of us. OPINION: How Facebook hurt the Syrian Revolution The people of Aleppo see us as the audience of a medieval amphitheatre, watching the blood and gore as spectators - some in disgust while some cheer on. And many of them starkly warn that this silence will come back to haunt us. A Syrian turned to me and asked, "Is it judgment day yet?" Surely the apocalypse can't be worse. How do you respond to a father who lost his home and shop other than to offer a hollow reassurance? It's been five years since I started covering the conflict. Talking to activists, rebels, self-declared intellectuals and civilians has become second nature. But it was the first time that their everlasting flame of hope felt as if it were flickering. And then Hanano fell, a neighbourhood which had stood against the government since 2012. Some former residents of Aleppo, now far from the city, couldn't hide their pain. They shared videos from four years ago of the chanting children, the marching youth, who were all punished for opposing their ruler. Even those fleeing the onslaught were not spared. Two days of attacks on a road linking besieged neighbourhoods killed more than 96 people - bodies strewn across the streets with belongings on their backs. Aleppo was seen as the heart of the revolution - an alternative capital to Damascus - the place that constantly fought with the regime, ISIL and al-Nusra Front simultaneously - the last remaining beacon of a peaceful revolt which turned into a bloody battle. OPINION: Syria's Civil War - Yet another 'iconic image'? It's easy to talk about the millions displaced, the thousands made into refugees, the half a million dead. But it's hard to look into a little girl's eyes who has lost a leg and a brother and tell her it will be okay. To meet a brave, smiling five-year-old who lost her vision to a sniper's bullet. To stare into the eyes of a man who lost his family and both his legs. To meet doctors and engineers and students and barbers and lawyers who live in perpetual limbo of the shadow of a war which has no end in sight. But then you meet the bright young men and women still pursuing their careers, still swooning over the beauty of their neighbourhoods, still romanticising the idea of people power, still hopeful for a future of opportunities to rebuild and start over again. Aleppo may have all but fallen but the past five years of interacting with resilient Syrians has made one reality very clear - their unwavering refusal to give up.

Fighters from rival neighbourhoods in Tripoli are also fighting each other on Syria's battlefield [Dylan Collins/Al Jazeera] Tripoli, Lebanon - Coupled alongside immense posters of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Syrian government flags, the faces of young men who died during violent clashes line the bullet-pocked walls of the Jabal Mohsen neighbourhood in this coastal city. For years, Tripoli has endured periodic bloodshed between Jabal Mohsen's Alawite residents and their neighbours downhill in the predominantly Sunni area of Bab al-Tabbaneh in Tripoli. Young men from both neighbourhoods have journeyed to Syria to take up arms. Yet, like in Tripoli, they find themselves on opposite sides of Syria's battlefield, with fighters from Jabal Mohsen joining the Syrian army or militias loyal to the Syrian government, which is controlled by Assad's Alawite sect. Sitting in a local cafe, a dozen men argued about the ongoing conflict in Syria over card games, coffee and cigarettes. Khodar, a 24-year-old who didn't provide his last name due to safety concerns, says he returned from Syria to Lebanon in June. "I fought in the [Syrian] army because the extremists [in al-Nusra Front and ISIL] have no mercy," Khodar, who served a two-and-a-half-year stint in an infantry unit of the Syrian army, told Al Jazeera. "I was in Raqqa, Deraa, [and] Palmyra." Both Jabal Mohsen and Bab al-Tabbaneh are heavily militarised, with clashes breaking out several times in recent years [Dylan Collins/Al Jazeera] "The [extremists] want to destroy Syria," Khodar said. "There are a lot of us from Jabal Mohsen in Syria today." Like many local residents, Khodar carries dual Lebanese-Syrian citizenship. Mario Abou Zeid , a research analyst at the Beirut-based Carnegie Middle East Center, explained that "a large number of Alawites serve in the Syrian military" or fight with pro-Assad militias, but "the Syrian regime has kept the exact number from the public". Many local Alawites were given Syrian citizenship during Syria's decades-long occupation of large swaths of Lebanon. Thousands of Syrian Alawites were also relocated to Jabal Mohsen by the Syrian government, which, through corrupt measures, was able to obtain Lebanese citizenship for them, as well. "Syria had a lot of power in the Lebanese government and made sure Syrian Alawites in Jabal Mohsen were given Lebanese citizenship for voting purposes and for bulking up one of its strongholds in Lebanon," Abou Zeid told Al Jazeera. RELATED: Syria's Druze reject calls for anti-government uprising Speaking to Al Jazeera, Jabal Mohsen residents said more and more young men have gone to Syria. Asked whether it was aware of Lebanese fighters in the Syrian army, a Lebanese military source confirmed knowledge of the trend but declined to comment further. According to Nadim Shehadi, a Middle East researcher and associate fellow at the Chatham House, the Syrian government "tried to clone its system in Lebanon between 1990 and 2005", when it withdrew its military from the country under growing pressure from protesters and critics. "It was an attempt to 'Baathify' part of Lebanon," he added, referring to Assad's ruling party. Foreign fighters are nothing new on Syria's battlefield. Hezbollah, the Lebanese political group and militia that supports the Assad government, has been fighting alongside the regime since the outset of the crisis. On the other side of the spectrum, fighters from across the globe have joined militant groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Although the Lebanese army works to prevent clashes in Tripoli, it has been unable to stop young men from travelling to Syria [Dylan Collins/Al Jazeera] Long before a largely unarmed uprising in Syria began in March 2011 - and quickly grew into a full-on civil war that has claimed more than 240,000 lives and displaced more than half of the population - fighting between Jabal Mohsen and Bab al-Tabbaneh was frequent. But with the Syrian catastrophe showing no sign of letting up, tensions have soared in Tripoli. Muhammad, a 30-year-old resident with joint Lebanese-Syrian citizenship, was first summoned for military service in Damascus during the summer of 2013. After six months, he was discharged for health reasons related to his asthma. He returned to Lebanon in December of that year. Born and raised in Jabal Mohsen, his 27-year-old brother Ahmad is currently serving in the Syrian army and is based in Deraa, a city in southern Syria. "He hasn't been able to visit since he started his service two years ago," Muhammad told Al Jazeera, explaining that Syrian soldiers are banned from leaving the country during their service. "My mom goes to the border to meet him, and that's the only way she can see him." RELATED: Lebanese communists gear up to battle ISIL "We are proud of him. We're proud of everyone who fights to protect Alawites in Syria," he explained, adding that many of his friends and relatives have volunteered in pro-Assad militias that fight alongside Syrian government forces. "Protecting them in Syria is the same to us as protecting Jabal Mohsen." Ali al-Aasi, 24, chain-smoked cigarettes as he flipped through pictures on his phone that he took in Syria while serving in a tank unit between 2013 and early 2015. He held up the screen to show a shot of him in a Syrian military uniform. He moved to the next image, in which he was manning a Syrian tank. Explaining that he enlisted in the Syrian army after his father was killed in a drive-by shooting by Salafist gunmen last year in Tripoli, he said: "I watched him die. I don't care any more if I die. My father shouldn't have died. He was a good man and didn't have any involvement in politics or these conflicts, but I'm a fighter." Homes on both sides of the dividing line between Bab al-Tabbaneh and Jabal Mohsen are littered with bullet holes [Dylan Collins/Al Jazeera] When clashes break out in Tripoli, Aasi also fights with local militias. Scrolling to an image of a machete he bought "for taking revenge" after his father was killed, he said: "We protect Alawites wherever they are. It's about our honour and our land." Khaldoun Sherif, a researcher who specialises in political movements in Tripoli, explained that regional conflicts, particularly the ongoing conflict in Syria, have led to a sharp rise of already existing sectarian tensions in Lebanon. "Every group or sect has allegiances to religious or ethnic groups in other countries," he told Al Jazeera. "But under the surface, sectarian is always about political differences." Jabal Mohsen's residents are no exception, he said. "There are strong political, cultural and religious relations between Lebanese Alawites and their brethren in Syria, so it's natural that they would support Bashar al-Assad's regime." RELATED: Assad defends presence of Hezbollah fighters in Syria But fighting next door presents the risk of reigniting fighting at home. "It's neither easy nor safe for them to come back to Tripoli and have people from pro-Syrian opposition groups know they fought with Bashar," Sherif said. "It could be very dangerous for their community or their families." Meanwhile, the Syrian army is enduring a shortage of troops as many soldiers or young men of military age flee the country to avoid service. "A shortage of manpower exists," Assad admitted during a speech in Damascus in late July. Ali Foda, spokesman for a pro-Assad party in Lebanon, argues that the Syrian government is making gains [Dylan Collins/Al Jazeera] Declining to comment on Lebanese fighters who back Assad forces next door, Ali Foda, spokesman for the Assad-funded Arab Democratic Party, said only that "the Syrian regime is in the best place it's been in years.

Thirteen-year-old Ahmed attends school part-time and spends the rest of his day working in a restaurant with his brothers [Zouhir Shimale/Al Jazeera] Aleppo, Syria - Ahmed Subi is only 13 years old, but, in many ways, his childhood ended three years ago. He lives in Aleppo, Syria's largest town. In 2012, the Battle of Aleppo, fought between forces loyal to the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and various rebel groups, began. That was when Ahmed stopped attending school full-time. Instead, he had to work alongside his brothers in a restaurant in order to help support his family. When his father, Tofi, was killed in a government air strike, the financial burden on the siblings grew. Now, he studies for half of the day and works for the rest. It is a life somewhere between childhood and adulthood: filled with the responsibilities of an adult, but also the simple pleasures - cartoons and candy, in Ahmed's case - of a child. RELATED: Life on hold "I've always loved to learn," he says, standing on a street in downtown Aleppo. Ahmed wants the education he does receive to be put to good use in the future. "I want to be an engineer and rebuild the country's buildings and bring back life to my city that I love," he says. From his bedroom window he sometimes sees children playing. He says a government sniper used to shoot at the window. He doesn't know why he stopped. When he grows up, Ahmed wants to be an engineer and to rebuild the city that he loves [ Zouhir Al Shimale /Al Jazeera] Interview with Ahmed What one possession means the most to you? My favourite possessions are my books. But I don't have time to read them and I don't have any books that aren't from school. What is your happiest memory? The sweetest memory was my last birthday with my mum and dad, before my dad's passing. They threw me a small party with gifts and sweets. It was the last time I was with my mum and dad at the same time. What is your saddest memory? My saddest memory was the passing of my father after barrel bombs struck our home. I was at my aunt's house for a visit with my mum. We heard a loud sound as the explosion took place and went home where my father was. He died in the bombing and I never saw him again. We didn't even get the chance to see his body or bury him. What is your favourite place? My favourite place is my school. It's the only place where I feel great and learn new things. The days when the school was closed due to the regime's bombs were some of the hardest in my life. But now the school is open again and I'm very happy. Who is your favourite cartoon or television character? I really like the show Detective Conan because he teaches me to look for and find out things that are hard to solve. I also like his adventures where he searches for criminals and arrests them. What do you worry about most? The thing I worry about the most is the plane bombings that may kill me or my family, or make me alone or lose one of my limbs. If there was one thing you could change about the world, what would it be? If I could change one thing I would ban the use of weapons that destroy everything and are used to kill people. Maybe then people could live in peace. Eleven-year-old Yusuf Fathi doesn't go to school and isn't allowed to play outside in the street as his parents fear the bombs that killed his youngest brother [ Zouhir Al Shimale /Al Jazeera] Yusuf Fathi is an 11-year-old from Aleppo. He is a friend of Ahmed's. He spends most of his time at home. His family doesn't send him to school, and only rarely allows him to play in the neighbourhood with the other children. They fear the bombs that took his youngest brother's life. Yusuf, too, is afraid of the bombs and the planes that fly overhead. His father in particular is worried about his son's safety. Last year, bombs struck Yusuf's school, killing some of his friends and teachers. Now, instead of going to school, he helps his mum around the house, watches television and plays with his little brothers. He is only allowed to leave the house with his father. Like Ahmed, he has a love for learning and an interest in Japanese cartoons. Sometimes he plays in the street with Ahmed and his other friends, but not often. From his bedroom window, he watches his friends going to school - and wishes he could join them. From his bedroom window, Yusuf watches his friends going to school; he wishes he could join them [ Zouhir Al Shimale /Al Jazeera] Interview with Yusuf What one possession means the most to you? My favourite possessions are new clothes, especially during Eid. I haven't seen new clothes on Eid in four years. What is your happiest memory? My favourite memory was when we celebrated Eid with our whole, big family. What is your saddest memory? The worst memory was when a plane bombed our home and trapped us under the rubble. We got hurt, but made it out alive. What is your favourite place and why? My favourite place is my garden. I like my neighbourhood too. Who is your favourite cartoon or television character? Goku from Dragon Ball Z is my favourite because he's a strong person and has the fighting skills to fight any evil person for the sake of good. What do you worry about most? Something that worries me a lot is the fear of death at any moment, and especially the sound of a plane or an alarm. If there was one thing you could change about the world, what would it be? If I could change one thing in the world it would be ending wars and living in peace without bombing, clashes or the sound of planes. And we could go to school and play without the fear of planes or missiles or anything that could kill us.

There are many remaining unknowns of the Syria conflict but it is increasingly becoming clear that the situation is moving into its final phases. All indications are that there will be no clear military victory and that some form of negotiated settlement is inevitable. The Syrian context has been transformed since the failed coup in Turkey last summer and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's subsequent shift to consolidate his grip over the country. This opening has led to the Astana process and rejuvenated hopes in an "Eastern" solution, based on Turkish, Russian and, to some extent, Iranian cooperation. While Astana has presented the most durable set of ceasefires so far in the conflict, it reinforced the inevitability of Bashar al-Assad remaining central to the foreseeable future of Syria. In public, the calls for his removal are becoming fainter by the day, while in private, many, including some leading figures of opposition, are actively considering their options with him in office. A political settlement that includes Assad will have far-reaching implications for Syria's long-term peace and stability. In the immediate term, this will affect the efficacy of a transition on a number of fronts. Simultaneous processes Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5358580396001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5358580396001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: The Syrian Civil War Reaches Its 6th Year (1:28) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY First, given the likelihood that some remnants of the armed opposition will neither be defeated nor incorporated into a political settlement, any peace agreement is likely to uneasily coexist alongside efforts to combat ongoing resistance. Rejectionist rebels will likely regroup, rearm, and fortify in the rural hinterlands with the aim of destabilising any post-conflict transition in Syria. This is already happening to some degree in Idlib, Daraa and elsewhere. Similarly, the militias that fought for Assad will continue to seek a role in the post-settlement era. One of the major challenges will, therefore, be the Demobilisation, Disarmament, and Reintegration (DDR) of tens of thousands of fighters who have known nothing but war over the last six years. Those not addressed will quickly disperse, and be driven into the arms of new insurgent groups, most likely in the form of a hybrid insurgency composed of the hardline anti-regime and or anti-settlement forces. Second, while the political process will likely frame Syria as one unitary state with formal institutions, such as a governing council or another transitional body, new parliament, or legal system, informal aspects of the political settlement will constrain state effectiveness. OPINION: Six must-read opinions on Syria's sixth war anniversary Given the nature of the conflict, backroom deals must, out of necessity, be formed at all levels, whether to satisfy Iranian ambitions, assuage the sectarian divisions, or reward Assad supporters who will inevitably feel that they have won the war for him on the battlefield. These unwritten, informal agreements, pacts and alliances could prove to be an immense handicap on Syria's formal institutions. Administratively, state revenue will be a great challenge, in particular, the issue of local taxation, which is critical to a sustainable funding base and also to reconstituting state-citizen relations. Even with a potentially strong asset base, it is likely that Syria will, for many years to come, generate symptoms of state fragility and lack of financial resources. Reconstructing Syria Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5358784560001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5358784560001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > AL JAZEERA WORLD: Syria - The Roots of Tyranny (47:30) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Furthermore, the nature of political transition will have a strong influence over the possibility for financing reconstruction. The cost of reconstruction will be high, with estimates ranging from $170bn to over one trillion dollars ( PDF ). Whatever way the numbers are interpreted, Syria will be in need of vast amounts of international aid. Yet, Russia cannot afford to foot the bill for large-scale reconstruction and the United States President Donald Trump has announced an end to the era of nation-building. The biggest contributors will therefore likely be the European Union and the Gulf states. However, under an unreconstructed Assad regime, it is unlikely that the Gulf states will go back to their prewar levels of support to Syria. The EU has a clear interest in bringing stability to Syria, in particular since Turkey can no longer be expected to act as a buffer zone. While the EU will have to hold its nose and deliver the cash, it will expect its funds to be handled separately from the Syrian state coffers. This will involve the design of sub-entities and parallel structures - some of which may bear the name of the Syrian government - but under a high degree of international supervision to ensure acceptable standards of accountability. The move of rebuilding under a protracted insurgency will lead to uneven reconstruction and development in Syria. This poses dangers for Syrian ownership of the reconstruction process and a long-term risk in de-capacitating the Syrian state while it is in a process of state-building. The inability to trust the government will also mean that for the transitional phase reconstruction will be conceptualised only in terms of incremental, small-scale, humanitarian-driven projects rather than the massive economic and infrastructure reconstruction efforts that are required. Furthermore, with sanctions, travel bans and other punitive measures are likely to be put in place if Assad were to continue his hold on power, and there is a risk of creating an isolated regime in the mould of Eritrea or Sudan rather than bringing the country back into the international fold of trade and development. Uneven reconstruction Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5363026424001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5363026424001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH : The man who introduced the police state to Syria (1:59) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Fourth, the move of rebuilding under a protracted insurgency will lead to uneven reconstruction and development in Syria. In the absence of an effective state, the private sector which in Syria has traditionally been efficient and effective - in part because of the dependable inefficiency of the prewar Syrian state - is likely to be welcomed back with open arms. Yet, given its nature and drive to generate a high return, its investments are likely to target areas where stability and security have also returned. This will create a situation with sharply defined corridors of growth and a national development landscape that is operating at two or three different speeds. OPINION: Reconstructing Syria - The need to break the mould Such an imbalance would offer the "warlords", who have thrived throughout the conflict, the opportunity to launder their reputation into "reconstruction lords" in its aftermath, with more or less consistently marginalised areas of Syria continuing to pay the price. Finally, although perhaps half of all Syrians will accept Assad's rule, embarking on a reconciliation process would be extremely difficult with him in power. Given the launch of the international commission into abuses as well as the numerous accusations that have and will be made about the regime, transitional justice - particularly at the local and village level where local communities have witnessed the worst atrocities - may require imaginative forms of integrating religious and tribal justice mechanisms to reach a degree of closure and heal the wider wounds caused by six years of war and decades of repression.

A child receiving treatment at a field hospital after an alleged chemical attack in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in north Idlib province. [EPA] News flash: Bashar al-Assad is bad. He has been murdering his own people for more than six years now. Before that, his father did the same. And not once in the decades the Assad family has held power in Syria did it need "justification" for its crimes against humanity. Thus, a confirmed nerve agent attack on Khan Sheikhoun, one of many chemical weapons attacks committed by the regime, is not out of the ordinary! Pro-Syrian revolution individuals or organisations who say that Assad committed chemical attacks on Khan Sheikhoun are not calling for World War III - they are simply naming the aggressor, as they have been doing for more than six years. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5403135248001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5403135248001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > Syria: Heartbroken parents searching for missing children PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Assad knows, six years in, that the entire international community isn't willing to take concrete steps resulting in his removal. And that is why it is completely ridiculous to even entertain questions like: "Why would the regime do this?"; "Why would the regime use chemical weapons?"; "Why would the regime use chemical weapons on Khan Sheikhoun?" Dictators kill because they can. They use chemical weapons because they are simply another tool at their disposal. It is not surprising that a regime which has dropped countless barrel bombs on its own people and invited occupiers into its country would use chemical weapons, and it is quite absurd that Syrians who have had to physically and ideologically fight Assad, Russia , Iran, ISIL and al-Qaeda all at once are constantly called upon to combat the narratives of these "woke naysayers" when their bigger concern is surviving whatever the regime and its allies throw at them next. Khan Sheikhoun Located about 90km from the Turkish border, the town of Khan Sheikhoun falls on the Damascus-Aleppo International Highway. Its civilian local council is led by Osama al-Sayadi. No armed factions maintain a presence in the town after Jund al-Aqsa tried but failed to capture it earlier this year. Since its liberation from regime forces in June 2014, the town has been and continues to be subjected to air strikes by the regime and its allies, including a strike hours after Trump ordered the attacks on Shayrat airbase. The city is also home to thousands of internally displaced families from surrounding areas such as rural Hama. OPINION: Syrians should not be thanking Trump for the strikes Initially, the regime and Russia claimed they had carried out an air strike on "terrorist chemical weapons stores." But journalists from the area, as well as a journalist from the Guardian, provided video and photographic evidence that in fact, what regime and Russian media sources were calling a chemical weapons storage facility were actually abandoned silos the regime had destroyed in air strikes months earlier. Russia enables the regime, and the US knows this Late 2013, the UN Security Council charged the US and Russia with removing the Assad regime's chemical weapons stockpile. After several delays and missed deadlines, the country was declared to be rid of its chemical weapons by mid-2014. Mere months later, the UN raised concerns the Assad regime had not fully disclosed all its chemical weapons facilities. Furthermore, the regime and Russia have continued to use chlorine to bomb Syrian civilians and Internally displaced people, as well as napalm , white phosphorus (or incendiary) bombs, cluster bombs, anti-aircraft missiles and vacuum bombs , among others. Russia has even bragged about the weapons it has tested on Syrian civilians. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5399486072001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5399486072001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > How the US media reacted to Trump's Syria attack - The Listening Post PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Given this, the US' declaration that its attack on Shayrat airbase was a direct response to the use of chemical weapons was quite puzzling. It became even more puzzling when the US admitted it had notified Russia, an ally of the regime, that the air strikes were coming. But perhaps most puzzling of all is that even given these facts about Russia's role as an enabler of the regime, self-proclaimed analysts still insisted on circulating the regime's official line: Syrians had orchestrated the Khan Sheikhoun attack, with the help of al-Qaeda, in order to incite a response from the US. Selective solidarity When the Israeli army bombs Gaza, it is rightfully taken to account by both Arab and western pro-Palestine activists. After Israel's major assault on Gaza in 2014 (Operation Protective Edge), the very same people now questioning whether Assad's regime was responsible for the Khan Sheikhoun sarin attack were organising protests at that time and pushing for Israel to be punished. Assad, with the assistance of Russia and Iran, has been doing the same and worse to his own people. So why is it that these activists aren't expressing any outrage against the Assad regime, instead choosing to defend it? They do not question the fact Israel is using internationally prohibited weapons on civilians when "it clearly has the upper hand". Russia and Iran have been in Syria for years now, both as occupiers, and both committing crimes against humanity. Yet, it is only when the US or Israel strikes an Arab nation that anti-war groups wake up to protest, publishing statements on the sovereignty of Syria and protesting while holding photos of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. And when Syrians against Assad, living in the West as refugees, counter their narratives, they are silenced or accused of supporting terrorism. This type of selective solidarity wastes the time and energy of Syrian journalists and civil society activists who are continually being put on the defensive. This dehumanisation of the Syrian people by the very activists who say they stand for human rights is incomprehensible. They send a clear message: they will never be convinced of the regime's brutality, even if they witness it themselves.

French President Emmanuel Macron has spoken against the deposing of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad [Reuters/Jean-Paul Pelissier] There is much to celebrate in Emmanuel Macron 's ascent to the French presidency. The election was a resounding defeat for the forces of reaction. Macron conducted himself with decency and intelligence and achieved his victory without submitting to the prevailing xenophobic impulse. In acknowledging France's imperial excesses, in standing up to Vladimir Putin , and in resisting Donald Trump 's provocations, he seemed to herald a bold new politics that would align power with principle. Since assuming power, however, Macron's statements have been more equivocal. His recent comments on Syria suggest that in the balance between ideals and pragmatism, the president is leaning heavier on the latter. Speaking to the European press, Macron announced his break with past policy. " I haven't said the deposing of Bashar al-Assad is a prerequisite for everything," he said. "Because no one has introduced me to his legitimate successor!" Instead, he emphasised the need for " a political and diplomatic roadmap"; because, "We won't solve the question only with military force."

(25:00) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The cliche about military force would be meaningful, if it came from the party that is committed to military victory. But the monopoly on violence in Syria is held by the regime and its allies, Russia, Iran , and Hezbollah. Together, they are responsible for over 90 percent of all civilian deaths. The West has deployed its military force primarily against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) and al-Qaeda , and, occasionally, also against anti-Assad fighters ( often indiscriminately). France has never confronted Assad ; and only under Trump has the US tackled the regime in five rare instances, the most significant being the cruise missile strike on the Shayrat airbase after the sarin attack on Khan Sheikhoun. For the leader of France to foreswear military force in Syria is quite meaningless. The real question is if Assad, Russia and Iran accept that there is no military solution. They don't. It is also not necessary for Syrians to produce a legitimate leader before they can rid themselves of a decidedly illegitimate one. The very cause of the conflict in Syria is that citizens were denied the right to elect legitimate leaders. Which is what makes Macron's next statement puzzling. "Democracy isn't built from the outside without the people," he says. But in Syria, people inside were trying to build democracy. The only assistance they asked for was not to be gassed, starved, tortured or disappeared in the process. To avoid having to address the present, Macron reverts to the past and refers to the debacles in Iraq and Libya. "What was the result of those interventions?" he asks. "Failed states where terrorist groups prospered." Syria will never be at peace as long as Assad remains in power. Over half of Syria's population will be unable to return home for fear of reprisal (and why wouldn't Assad seek and destroy his enemies, since he has learned that there is literally no crime that he cannot get away with). But the Iraq war had nothing in common with Libya , let alone with Syria. There was no popular uprising in 2003 and nor was there an imminent humanitarian crisis . Saddam had committed his worst crimes in the 1980s and 90s. In Libya, France intervened, with UN support, to prevent an imminent slaughter and 75 percent of the Libyan population approved. The subsequent disaster had less to do with Muammar Gaddafi 's removal than with the failure to help consolidate Libya's nascent democracy, leaving it vulnerable to domestic and foreign subversion - France's included. If Iraq and Libya have turned into "failed states where terrorist groups prospered", it's mainly because the logic of the " war on terror " has trumped the logic of democracy and human rights . It is in Syria, however, that Macron's argument really founders. If Iraq shows that unprovoked action has consequences, Syria proves that inaction in the face of provocation, too, can lead to disaster. T he war Syrian has killed over a half-million people, over five million have fled and 6.3 million are internally displaced. The root of the Syrian crisis is the Syrian regime; ISIL is its mere symptom. Committing to fight the latter while ignoring the former is not "realism", it is wishful thinking. Macron has been at his most effective when he speaks from principle. His reiteration of his red line - which he has now expanded to also include humanitarian corridors - is a welcome development. But if he believes that Assad is merely an enemy of the Syrian people, then he needs to be reacquainted with John Donne's admonition: no man is an island. In 2013, Barack Obama also thought Assad was someone else's problem and walked away from his redline. With this residual constraint lifted, the regime escalated its violence and killed nearly four times as many people in the two years after the chemical attack as it had in the two years before. This was the turning point that discredited Assad's democratic opposition, empowered the Islamists, and led to the rise of ISIL. It was also the moment when the refugees ' flight spiked. The overflow from this deluge trickling into Europe sparked the xenophobic backlash that the far right has exploited across the West; and, while the brunt of ISIL terror is born by Syrians and Iraqis, Europe, too, became a target of its indiscriminate fury. Macron should know, because in the same interview he criticised Obama for failing to enforce his redline, creating a vacuum that was filled by the forces of reaction. But that abdication is not a historical detail: Its effects continue to fester.

Over half of Syria's population will be unable to return home for fear of reprisal (and why wouldn't Assad seek and destroy his enemies, since he has learned that there is literally no crime that he cannot get away with). ISIL will be defeated, but the morbid symptoms it embodies may take even more grotesque form unless the underlying cause is addressed. In the interview, Macron spoke eloquently of Europe's love of justice; he also spoke of democracy, individual freedoms and social justice; and he warned of the threat of authoritarian regimes. The Syrians who rose up against Syria's authoritarian regime share these principles . Macron's words will ring hollow if he allows these people to be crushed and authoritarians everywhere will be emboldened, taking this as license to ruthlessly quash dissent. What Assad has done in Syria is not a crime against Syrians alone, it is a crime against humanity. It is not for Syria alone that the bell tolls, it tolls for all of us. Macron says he rejects neoconservative interventionism; but he needs to be just as leery of "realist" lack of imagination. It was the pursuit of "stability" after all that gave us the Mubaraks, Saddams and Assads. The aggravating dissonance will persist until the West learns to side with citizens instead of their oppressors. Muhammad Idrees Ahmad is Lecturer in Digital Journalism at the University of Stirling.

Mohamed Alloush, the head of the Syrian opposition delegation at the first round of talks, told Al Jazeera that the decision to boycott was taken because their demands were not being addressed. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5318176387001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5318176387001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > The Boy who started the Syrian War (47:36) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY "The Russians did not abide by their promises. They didn't release prisoners, they didn't stop the bombing, they didn't stop the forced displacement," Aloush said. Abdul Majeed Barakat, political adviser to the Free Syrian Army (FSA) factions involved in the Turkey-backed Euphrates Shield Operation in northern Syria , told Al Jazeera that the opposition was not clear on what the plans were for this round of talks in Kazakhstan's capital - and Turkey didn't push it to attend. "The Turks did not really encourage the participation [of the opposition]. They didn’t stop it, but they didn't encourage it either," said Barakat . Commenting on the boycott, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the reasons the opposition offered were "unconvincing". He said the no-show was "unexpected", and on Monday he talked with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, about it. "We have reason to believe that there is some kind of a misunderstanding. In any case, the Astana meeting will proceed along the way which was outlined in the UNSC resolution 2254," he told journalists at a press conference in Moscow. READ MORE: Six years on, The price of saying 'NO' to Assad In Astana, Syrian government envoy Bashar al-Jaafari blamed Turkey for the opposition boycott. "When one of the three guarantors breaks their commitment - and I mean Turkey - this means that Turkey must be the one that is asked about the non-attendance or participation of these armed groups," al-Jaafari said. Turkey's delegation, headed by deputy undersecretary of the ministry of foreign affairs Sedat Onal, is attending the discussions, which are scheduled to end on Wednesday. According to Emre Ersen, a lecturer at Marmara University's Department of Political Science and International Relations in Istanbul, the opposition boycott has to do with disagreements between Russia and Turkey on Syria. "It is related to the current rift between Turkey and Russia regarding Manbij. They couldn't overcome their differences in the latest Putin and Erdogan meeting," Ersen told Al Jazeera. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on March 10 in Moscow. During the meeting, Erdogan made it clear that Turkey expected Russia to end ties with Kurdish armed groups such as the People Protection's Unit (YPG) that it considers a "terrorist" organisation. INTERACTIVE: Syria under siege The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which include the YPG, recently gave up territory in favour of Syrian government forces west of the city of Manbij, in northern Aleppo province. Shortly after, Russia announced its presence in the city. US troops, which provide logistical support and training to the SDF, were also present in the Manbij area. SDF's withdrawal in favour of the Syrian forces effectively stopped the progress of Turkey’s Euphrates Shield Operation against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). According to Ersen, the refusal of the armed opposition to join the talks in Astana is a way for Ankara to suggest its dissatisfaction with the current situation in northern Syria. The move, however, could endanger the normalisation in Russian-Turkish relations. "[The opposition's boycott] might create a problem for Russia in terms of its influence in the Syria peace process. Astana actually symbolises Russia's dominance in the Syrian question, because it excludes the United States," Ersen said. "It is the Russian plan. If it fails, if it is undermined because of this, it will definitely create a bigger problem between Turkey and Russia." The opposition's no-show at Astana came a week after the fourth round of negotiations in Geneva ended with almost no progress. A new round of talks in Switzerland is scheduled for March 23.

The attack in Idlib this week forced a quick change in Trump's stance on Assad [Reuters] US President Donald Trump has hinted at possible military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as his administration considers retaliatory options after a chemical weapons attack killed more than 80 people. "I think what happened in Syria is a disgrace to humanity and he's there, and I guess he's running things, so something should happen," Trump told reporters on Air Force One, en route to meet China's President Xi Jinping at a Florida summit on Thursday. While Trump stopped short of calling on Assad to leave office, the comments were his strongest suggestion yet that the United States may be edging towards a stronger stance against Assad. His stance was underlined by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who told reporters: "There's no role for [Assad] to govern the Syrian people".

"The process by which Assad would leave is something that will require an international community effort," Tillerson said, adding there needs to be a balance between defeating the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) and stabilising Syria to prevent the war from escalating. Tillerson also issued a warning to Russia , a key ally of Damascus, that its support of the Assad government is something it should "consider carefully". The poison gas attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province killed at least 86 people, including 27 children, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Turkey said samples from victims of Tuesday's attack indicate they were exposed to sarin , a highly toxic nerve agent. READ MORE: US warns of unilateral Syria moves if UN fails to act The World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders also reported that victims from the attack showed symptoms consistent with the use of a nerve agent such as sarin. The Syrian government rejected the accusations, and Moscow warned against apportioning blame until an investigation has been carried out. Trump has until now focused his Syria policy almost exclusively on defeating ISIL in northern Syria, where US special forces are working with Arab and Kurdish armed groups. Only last week, the US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said the US diplomatic policy on Syria was no longer focused on forcing Assad to leave power.

An anonymous US official told Reuters news agency on Thursday that options being discussed by the Pentagon and White House could include grounding aircraft used by Assad's forces. Others could include the use of cruise missiles, allowing the US to strike targets without putting piloted aircraft in the skies above Syria.

Erdogan said Turkey would be prepared to do "whatever falls on us" to support possible military action. Jessica Ashooh, the deputy director of the Middle East Strategy Task Force at the Atlantic Council, a foreign policy think-tank in Washington DC, said every president is tested early on and it appears that Syria has become the test for Trump and his administration. "What he does in this situation is going to colour how the world views his presidency and it's going to influence what countries like Russia or North Korea believe they can or cannot get away with," she told Al Jazeera. If confirmed, the chemical attack will be the deadliest since sarin gas killed hundreds of civilians in Ghouta near the capital, Damascus, in August 2013. Western states said the Syrian government was responsible for the 2013 attack. Damascus blamed rebels.

The foreign ministers of Russia and Qatar met on Saturday in Moscow for talks on Syria's future [Maxim Shemetov/Reuters] Qatar joined Russia and its allies in demanding an independent investigation into a chemical weapon attack in Syria that killed more than 80 people, saying the perpetrators must be punished to prevent future use of poison gas. The foreign ministers of Russia , Sergey Lavrov, and Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, met on Saturday in Moscow for talks on Syria's six-year war. The poison gas attack on a rebel-held town in Idlib province earlier this month was a point of discussion. Images and video published shortly after the incident showed dozens of men, women, and children gasping for air , convulsing, and foaming at the mouth. "The meeting saw the two sides agree on the importance of holding an independent investigation into the chemical attacks that took place in Khan Sheikhoun in Syria," the official Qatar News Agency (QNA) reported. READ MORE: Syria's civil war explained from the beginning The US has blamed Syria's government for the deadly gas attack, and launched a barrage of Tomahawk cruise missiles against a government-controlled airbase in response. Syria's government says it had nothing to do with the bloodshed in Khan Sheikhoun, and staunch ally Russia has stood by those claims. Russia blocked a UN Security Council resolution on Wednesday that demanded Syria cooperate with an investigation by the UN's chemical weapons watchdog, saying the probe should be widened to include experts from many nations. Qatar is a leading backer of rebels fighting Syria's President Bashar al-Assad , who has received key military and diplomatic support from Russia during the war that has killed hundreds of thousands.

"Qatar [was] working out whether the Russian commitment to Assad could be made any weaker, and Russia was looking to see if Qatari support for armed opposition groups could be made any weaker," said Challands. It was unclear, however, if either side achieved much from the meeting other than an agreement to keep talking, he said. One thing the two countries did agree upon was the need for an independent probe into who released chemical weapons in Idlib. According to QNA, Al Thani said the use of poison gas would continue if the perpetrators aren't brought to justice. "The horrific scenes in Khan Sheikhoun cannot be replicated and not punishing the perpetrators will be a gateway to repeating similar attacks in the future," he said. READ MORE: Syria chemical attack survivors vow to fight for justice Al Thani's trip to Moscow closely follows visits by foreign ministers from the United States , Syria and Iran. Assad said on Thursday the poison gas attack in Khan Sheikhoun was a "fabrication" to justify a US military strike . Syria insists it turned over all chemical weapons stockpiles in 2013, and has invited international inspectors to visit the airbase targeted by the US, which Washington claimed served as a platform for the chemical weapon attack. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has blamed Assad's government for at least two attacks in 2014 and 2015 involving the use of chlorine. In the lead-up to the government takeover of the rebel-held half of Aleppo last last year, Human Rights Watch reported on the government's "systematic" use of chlorine gas , marking at least eight incidents in which military helicopters dropped the chemical into residential areas.

Anti-Assad forces have repelled government advance in Eastern Ghouta outside Damascus [EPA] Activists say 28 Syrian government soldiers have been killed in a firefight after a military unit was ambushed near the capital, Damascus. The ambush on Thursday followed days of intense fighting as opposition-held suburbs of Damascus have come under a government offensive. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said the soldiers and allied fighters were ambushed in the village of Rihan, east of Damascus. Anas al-Dimashqi, an opposition activist based in the area, and the SOHR said the ambush killed at least 28 troops and pro-government fighters. Syrian government forces and their allies have been trying to storm the eastern suburbs of Damascus, known as Eastern Ghouta , but have struggled to penetrate opposition defences. More than 330,000 people have been killed in Syria since the ongoing conflict began with anti-government protests in March 2011. Turf wars Elsewhere in Syria, fighters in the northwestern region have gained ground from their Turkey-backed rivals after battling for a second successive day, according to opposition sources. They said clashes persisted in most of Idlib's major towns on Thursday between Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham, a faction led by the formerly al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front, and its rival Ahrar al-Sham. Even outside Idlib, Tahrir al-Sham and Ahrar al-Sham - who have thousands of fighters spread across Syria - were reinforcing their positions and putting their forces on heightened alert, according to an opposition source.

Their turf wars have helped Assad and his allies recover significant ground in the north and around Damascus. Tensions have been building between Idlib province's two biggest anti-government factions, mainly over ideological differences. They have also vied for dominance in the only Syrian province that is entirely under opposition control. Recent clashes on the outskirts of Idlib towns that rival factions had promised to local councils would be spared from conflict have raised the risk of fighting spilling into these heavily populated urban areas, opposition sources said. Tahrir al-Sham on Thursday rejected a mediation initiative by prominent religious leaders. It said the only way to end the fighting was to set up a local regional administration for the opposition-held north that would help reconcile factions and deter foreign meddling in the conflict.

Syrian rebels have been fighting for six years to remove President Bashar al-Assad from power [Alaa Al-Faqir/Reuters] The Trump administration has decided to halt the CIA's covert programme to equip and train certain rebel groups in Syria fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad , two US officials said, a move sought by Assad ally Russia . The Washington Post was first to report the programme's suspension on Wednesday. The US decision, said one of the officials, is part of an effort by the administration to improve relations with Russia, which, along with Iranian-supported groups, has largely succeeded in preserving Assad's government in the six-year civil war . The CIA programme began in 2013 as part of efforts by the administration of then-President Barack Obama to overthrow Assad, but produced little success, said the officials, both of whom are familiar with the programme and spoke on the condition of anonymity. READ MORE: Syria's 'moderate rebels' to form a new alliance White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders declined to comment on the topic at a White House briefing. The CIA also declined to comment. The decision was made nearly a month ago with National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and CIA Director Mike Pompeo after they consulted with lower ranking officials and before Trump's July 7 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Germany. It was not part of US-Russian negotiations on a ceasefire in southwestern Syria, the two officials said. A bid to improve Russia ties One of the officials said the US was not making a major concession, given Assad's grip on power, although not on all of Syria, "but it's a signal to Putin that the administration wants to improve ties to Russia". Al Jazeera's Heidi Zhou-Castro, reporting from Washington, DC, said the efficacy of the CIA programme to support "moderate" rebels fighting Assad has come under question since Russia's intervention in 2015 to support Assad. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5512284687001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5512284687001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > Putin, Trump held second undisclosed G20 conversation PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY "But even at its inception, this programme was considered to be minuscule - it would only arm a few hundred Syrian rebel fighters a month," she said. "And then in 2015 when Russia entered the conflict, throwing its oversized military weight behind Assad ... the CIA programme's perceived impact diminished to nearly inconsequential. "But the US held on to it, apparently in an effort to maintain it as a bargaining tool in future negotiations with Russia." Juan Cole, history professor at the University of Michigan, told Al Jazeera that the groups the CIA was training and arming are small and have largely been defeated. "So they're not much of a bargaining chip if that's what they were being held for," he said. Trump under pressure The move to phase out the programme comes as Trump is under intense scrutiny by congress and a special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Russia has denied US intelligence agencies' allegations of Moscow meddling, and Trump has denied collusion between his campaign and the Russians. "The bigger picture is that these developments are troubling because they're indicators of Trump's desire to get closer to Putin," said Al Jazeera's Zhou-Castro. "Analysts have called this behaviour 'bizarre' given that they are leaders of two world powers that are so much at odds and of course, lest we forget, there are those investigations in the US," she said. PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY A downside of the CIA programme, one of the officials said, is that some armed and trained rebels defected to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) and other armed groups. Some members of the previous Obama administration favoured abandoning the programme. The decision came as the US and Russia negotiated a ceasefire in southwest Syria, covering some of the areas from which the rebels operated. READ MORE: Syria's civil war explained from the beginning Support for the programme further eroded last year after the rebels lost the areas they held in the Syrian city of Aleppo under a brutal Russian-backed government assault. Before assuming office in January, Trump suggested he could end support for Free Syrian Army groups and give priority to the fight against ISIL. A separate effort by the US military effort to train, arm and support other Syrian rebel groups with air strikes and other actions will continue, the officials said. However, aside from air strikes after the Syrian military launched a chemical weapons attack, the Trump administration has not increased military support from the limits set by the Obama administration. Cole told Al Jazeera the US under Trump has increasingly few interests in Syria - its main focus is on defeating ISIL, which includes supporting the Kurdish-led SDF. "But I would be very surprised if [Trump] has the stamina or the interest in Syria to put down a marker for a long-term US presence there," said Cole. Al Jazeera's Heidi Zhou-Castro said the decision to cut the CIA programme leaves some unanswered questions. "How does phasing out the CIA programme serve US interests in Syria? And how - if at all - does it serve Trump's personal interest?" SOURCE: Al Jazeera and news agencies Syria's Civil War Middle East United States CIA Donald Trump
Syrians who have been displaced by the ongoing civil war in their country are heading home in larger numbers, according to a Switzerland-based migration agency. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Friday that nearly 603,000 Syrian refugees set off to return to their cities and villages in the first seven months of this year. The Syrians included in the figures were returning from other locations in Syria or from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. The number nearly matched the 685,662 people who returned during the whole of 2016, Olivia Headon, IOM spokesperson, said. The returning Syrians were motivated by the desire to protect their homes and possessions; an improved economic and security situation in their areas of origin; as well as problems with integration in their host countries, according to the IOM. Newly displaced About 67 percent of the returns this year have been to Syria's Aleppo province, where the opposition-held eastern part of the city was retaken by President Bashar al-Assad's government in December, the IOM said. But an estimated 808,661 people have been newly displaced this year, "many for the second or third time", Headon said. Syrians who remain internally displaced number at about 800,000, many of whom have fled violence and strife for the second or third time, according to the IOM.

ISIL, or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, has suffered military setbacks in recent months, losing ground in Syria and neighbouring Iraq . Syria's civil war, now in its seventh year, has devastated the country, claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and displaced about half of the prewar population of 22 million. Jaish al-Islam fighters killed Also on Friday, a suicide blast in southern Syria near the border with Jordan killed at least 23 fighters of the Jaish al-Islam group, according to a monitoring group. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said the bomber detonated an explosive belt at a base used by the fighters near the Nasib border crossing. "Most of the 23 killed were from Jaish al-Islam. Dozens were wounded, including 20 in critical condition," said Rami Abdel Rahman, SOHR's head. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. The Nasib border crossing - known as Jaber on the Jordanian side - lies in Syria's southern Deraa province and was captured by armed groups in April 2015. Lebanon recently arranged an exchange of prisoners along the border with Syria [Mohamad Azakir/Reuters] For its part, Turkey says new precautions are being taken along its border in response to recent developments in northwestern Syria. Speaking after Friday prayers in Ankara, Binali Yildirim, Turkey's prime minister, said "radical groups have taken over control" in Syria's Idlib province. Last month, al-Qaeda-linked Hayet Tahrir al-Sham - Arabic for Levant Liberation Committee, also known as HTS - captured the majority of Idlib after battles with the Ahrar al-Sham group. HTS also seized the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey's Hatay province. "We are taking the necessary precautions in Hatay's 150km border with Syria," Yildirim said, in order to prevent "humanitarian dramas" and threats against Turkey. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that talks on the situation in Idlib are ongoing between the country's intelligence service, Iran and Russia.

More than 10 people have been killed in apparently coordinated blasts in the capital of Syria , Damascus, according to several sources. A car bomb went off near a police station in Damascus' al-Midan neighbourhood on Monday, shortly before two suicide bombers detonated their explosive belts, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said. The 11 dead included police officers and civilians, the SOHR said, adding that the attack also caused injuries. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Syrian state TV blamed two suicide bombers for a "terrorist explosion" in al-Midan area while the pro-government Al Mayadeen TV channel said four fighters carried out the attack, killing more than 10 people. Minister's account The fighters targeted the police station in al-Midan and clashed with police officers there, Mohammad al-Shaar, Syria's interior minister, said in comments broadcast by state television from the police station. One attacker blew himself up at the main entrance, and another detonated his explosive device on the first floor, he said.

Previous suicide attacks in Damascus have been claimed by both the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) group and the Hayet Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) alliance, which is led by the group formerly known as al-Nusra Front. Monday's attack came a day after SOHR said September was the deadliest month of the conflict this year, with at least 3,000 people, including 955 civilians, killed. "More than 70 percent of the civilians were killed in regime and Russian air raids, or in air raids of the international coalition" battling ISIL, also known as ISIS, according to Rami Abdel Rahman, SOHR head . Backed by Russian air raids, the forces of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad are pressing a battle to retake ISIL-controlled areas in the eastern province of Deir Az Zor. A US-led international coalition has been providing air support to a Kurdish-Arab alliance, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), also fighting ISIL in its former northern bastion of Raqqa city and Deir Az Zor. Increased fighting The number of people killed in September was higher due to increased fighting and "intensified air raids of the international coalition and Russia against jihadist bastions in the north and east of Syria, but also due to increased Russian and regime strikes on rebel-held areas", Abdel Rahman said. Russian and government warplanes have in the past two weeks increased their strikes on the northwestern province of Idlib, which is largely controlled by HTS. The 955 civilians killed in September included 207 children, said the SOHR, which relies on a wide network of sources inside Syria for its information. It said the toll also included 790 government troops and loyalists, 738 fighters from ISIL and HTS, and 550 opposition fighters and SDF members. Syria's conflict has killed more than 330,000 people and displaced millions since it broke out in 2011 with a crackdown on anti-government protests before evolving into a complex war drawing in world powers.

Much to the frustration of many European tourists, it's not uncommon to be turned down by a taxi driver in Bangkok. But this time, what the driver said next was unexpected. "You can get a free ride over there," he said, gesturing towards MBK, the Byzantine shopping maze that was once the largest mall in Asia. True enough, a line of motorcycles, tuk-tuks and vans waited near the mall, their drivers clad in black, ready to take all-comers to the Grand Palace. IN PICTURES: Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej The occasion: the first full day for mourners to be allowed into the Grand Palace to pay their respect to King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The late king was widely revered in Thailand, and enormous crowds were expected as people from across the country made the journey to Bangkok to see his coffin. A quota of 10,000 people every day for two weeks are allowed to enter the throne hall, where the king's body lay in state. For many who saw the king as a divine figure, this was no ordinary trip, but a pilgrimage. Ten thousand people will be allowed to pay their respects to the king every day for two weeks [Jorge Silva/Reuters] The journey to pay respects holds a sacred element in many Thais' hearts - so much so that the driver of my free ride to the palace refused to accept any tip. The motorcycles and tuk-tuks at MBK were just a small part of the system that had swung into action to handle the influx. Free buses were arranged from all over Bangkok, and extra trains from around the country had also been organised, some free as well. To provide space for those congregating here, cars weren't allowed any further than Sanam Luang, the public square in front of the palace. On disembarking here, long queues of mourners were guided by officials towards a group of tents forming a perimeter around the field. Inside the perimeter, the queues were even longer, snaking back and forth across the massive field. It quickly became clear that the number of people here far exceeded the 10,000 a day quota, and many would be turned back. READ MORE: Remembering Thailand's beloved King Bhumibol The huge turnout led Thai authorities to scrap an opening time of 8am, letting people in from 5am instead. With about 70 people allowed to enter the throne hall at a time, the waiting time to enter was greater than five hours for most. On a rainy day, this seemed to deter few - many had camped overnight, braving the stormy weather, and continued to picnic on the field as they waited their turn, swapping stories about the man who had been the only king most of them had known during their lifetimes. "After the king died my friends and I just sat around the whole weekend and cried and cried," said Kamolpat Pisek, a building manager. "There's so many great things he did that I am learning about only now. I wish I had known these stories while he was still alive."

King Bhumibol Adulyadej was highly revered among Thai people during his seven decades on the throne [Getty Images] Bangkok, Thailand - Long revered by Thais as god-like, the world's longest reigning monarch - His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej - has died at 88. King Bhumibol, also known as Rama IX of the Chakri Dynasty, served 70 years as the constitutional monarch of the Southeast Asian nation. He has been praised as a constant force of unification in often tumultuous Thailand, addressing the needs of both urban and rural populations, as well as moderating infighting among the nation's divided political parties. Tirelessly striving to maintain the monarchy's influence amid a dozen coups, periods of military rule, and the killing of protesters, King Bhumibol's influence on the nation was undeniable. Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej dies at 88 He's often referred to as the "People's King" and will long be revered by those who bestowed this nickname upon him. His widespread social projects and development programmes secured him near-deity status, ensuring his legacy will persevere in a country with long-standing traditions of patriotism and loyalty to the royal family. "The king is my life," artist Kitithat Ekanansiri, 49, told Al Jazeera. "He brought the electricity and developed our village, and I know he treated all of us [Thai people] the same. He is the centre of Thais." King Bhumibol of Thailand in 1978 [Getty Images] Few monarchs in history have earned the absolute adoration of their subjects to the same extent. His portraits, simultaneously stoic and benevolent, are displayed proudly in living rooms, shops, and public spaces throughout the country. Sansoen Phra Barami, the royal anthem, is equally prominent, playing in cinemas, on television, and at the opening of every cultural event of note. While such ceremony would likely be seen as an inconvenience in many Western nations, the vast majority of Thais rise to their feet or pause in respect for the king's history of public service. Every year on December 5, tens of thousands of Thais dressed uniformly in yellow - the colour of the monarchy - flooded the streets and parks surrounding Bangkok's royal palace for Bhumibol's birthday. The night sky filled with floating fire-lanterns lit by crowds in honour of their "Father the King". As is the case with many monarchs, Thais initially respected King Bhumibol out of an obligation to tradition. But as his contributions to society grew in number and scale, that respect morphed into something more akin to love. "The king is more than the father of Thai people. When the country was on fire, he was the only person who could put it out," said Pan Buapradit, 59, a retired soldier. Achievements as 'Father' King Bhumibol was also portrayed as the "Development King". He had a diverse skill set and dedicated much of his reign to royal projects that developed infrastructure at the forefront of providing food and basic necessities for his people, by his people. These projects were started as self-conducted experiments in the gardens of Chitralada Villa, at his majesty's personal residence, the Dusit Palace. Experiments were conducted in agriculture, forestry, and small-scale industry. Once deemed successful, projects were made available to his people and implemented all over Thailand. Since his ascension to the throne, the king made regular visits to many rural and impoverished communities and sites, resulting in the implementation of some 3,000-plus projects since 1952. "He created plenty of royal projects to give jobs for the poor to improve the quality of Thai people's lives, and even to create artificial rain to solve the drought issue," Pan said. "He took care of us in every aspect. Nobody will ever be able to do for us as much as he did." King Bhumibol received several awards during his lifetime, most notably the first UNDP Human Development Lifetime Achievement Award presented by then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The accolade hailed the monarch's tireless efforts to help the kingdom's most poor and vulnerable people. IN PICTURES: The life of Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej The monarch's activities varied as different political regimes came to power over the course of his rule. He famously became the first monarch since the Siamese Revolution of 1932 to boat down the Chao Praya River to offer robes to Buddhist temples during the 700-year-old Thai ceremony Krabuan Phayuhayattra Chonlamak. This Royal Barge Procession ceremony took place 16 times during his reign. A King Bhumibol Adulyadej portrait at Siriraj Hospital in 2014 [Getty Images] King Bhumibol also played a key role in Thailand's transition into democracy. During deadly unrest in 1992, he urged opposition leaders General Suchinda Kraprayoon and retired Major-General Chamlong Srimuang to find a peaceful solution, and during a televised event, the two knelt before him in respect of royal protocol. His royal intervention led to a general election that resulted in the formation of a civilian government - earning him great respect from his nation. In 1997, the Asia financial crisis struck Thailand, devastating its economy. "He turned the crisis into the opportunity to teach us to live in a [self-]sufficient way," Anucha Thirakanont, 47, an academic, told Al Jazeera. "We will not see anybody work for the country as hard as him and we will never see Thai people love and respect anybody as much as him." Personal life Bhumibol was the son of HRH Prince Mahidol Adulyadej and HRH Princess Srinagarindra. He was born on December 5, 1927, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the United States, the only king of Thailand born outside of the country. His uncle Rama VII named him Bhumibol Adulyadej, an auspicious and prophetic name that translates to "Strength of the land" or "Incomparable power". Well-wishers hold a picture of the king [Jorge Silva/Reuters] King Bhumibol and his two siblings spent most of their formative years in Switzerland under the watchful eye of their mother after their father's death in 1929. His older brother, Ananda Mahidol, became the eighth king of Thailand at the age of nine. After World War II and Japanese occupation, the family returned to Thailand. In June 1946, King Ananda died in his bedroom from a single gunshot wound to the head. His death has never fully been explained. After his brother's death, Bhumibol ascended the throne and returned to Switzerland, where he redirected his studies at the University of Lausanne from science and technology to law and political science to better prepare himself for rule. It was during this period of the new king's life that he met his future wife, Rajawongse Sirikit, on a trip to Paris. The couple were engaged in July 1949 and married on April 28, 1950. Bhumibol was crowned King of Thailand on May 5, 1950. With the stabilising force of the beloved monarch now gone, many questions about Thailand's future remain. "I think that the new generation knows about the king through their lessons in schools or their family, but they do not have direct experience like their parents," said Chollada Hutayon, a 27-year-old engineer. "Therefore, some may not feel as much, and this can cause a big change for Thailand."

Under Thai law anyone convicted of insulting king or queen, heir or regent can face up to 15 years in jail on each count [Reuters] Thai police have arrested the creator of a Facebook group that opposes the government for allegedly posting pictures and content that "insult the monarch", local media say. According to Matichon, an online Thai news portal, Burin Thongprapai, the country's top legal officer, has announced plans to prosecute Thanakorn Siripaiboon, who was behind the "National Institute of Red Shirts" online group, for royal defamation. Police are also gathering evidence against 20 others who were administrators of the group, as well as any members of the Facebook page who shared or "liked" "inappropriate" posts from the group, Matichon reported. Thongprapai told AFP news agency that Thanakorn, a car spare-parts factory worker, was arrested at his home in Samut Prakan, near Bangkok, and charged with sedition, lese majeste and computer crimes. READ MORE: Asylum row highlights Thailand's human-trafficking blight On December 2, Thanakorn "liked" a doctored photo that portrayed Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej in a negative light and shared it with 608 friends, Burin said. He said he had confessed to the charges and faced up to 32 years in jail. Under Thai law, anyone convicted of insulting the king or queen, heir or regent can face up to 15 years in jail on each count. Thanakorn also shared an infographic about Rajabhakti Park, a multimillion-dollar park built by the military under construction contracts allegedly riddled with kickbacks and inflated costs. Prayut Chan-O-Cha and other generals insist there is no corruption but accusations persist in local media [AFP] "He admitted that he posted the infographic of Rajabhakti Park to incite members of the group" to oppose the military, Burin said. The arrest comes as the US ambassador to Thailand also reportedly faces a police investigation for royal defamation over a speech he made last month, in which he expressed concern over lengthy sentences handed to civilians for lese majeste. Park scandal Thailand's generals seized power last year, partially justifying their takeover as a necessary move to curb endemic corruption among the kingdom's civilian politicians and protect the royal family. Prosecutions over anti-monarch dissent have surged since the power shift, with the military leadership claiming to be a serious supporter of the monarchy. Last month, a woman handed herself in to police and was charged with sedition for sharing the same Facebook infographic about the park scandal. Police said she was still under investigation. Two prominent opposition figures and dozens of students were detained in separate incidents earlier this month while trying to visit the park and draw attention to the corruption scandal. The military leadership, including General Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the prime minister, has insisted there is no corruption in the park case but the accusations have still persisted in local media.

Anyone convicted of insulting a member of the royal family can face up to 15 years in jail on each count [Reuters] A court in Thailand has sentenced a man to six years in prison for violating the country's royal defamation laws over Facebook posts deemed offensive to the king. Bangkok Criminal Court said on Wednesday that 46-year-old Piya Julkittiphan was convicted for posting two pictures with messages in 2013 that risked making the public "disrespectful or unfaithful" to the monarchy. "The judge sentenced him to nine years but he has given useful testimony during the investigation so the court commuted one third of that sentence to six years' imprisonment," the court said in its verdict. It did not provide details on the content of the posts, as is common in Thai convictions for insulting members of the royal family. The Thai Lawyers for Human Rights group described Piya as a former stockbroker who was first arrested in December 2014 and has since been in custody. READ MORE: Man arrested in Thailand over Facebook posts King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 88, the world's longest-serving monarch, is shielded from criticism by some of the world's harshest royal defamation laws. Anyone convicted of insulting the king, queen, heir or regent - under laws known as lese majeste - can face up to 15 years in jail on each count. Last year two people received 25 and 30-year sentences over Facebook posts in record-breaking jail terms that drew international condemnation. Last month a man was arrested for allegedly making a satirical online remark about the recent death of the king's favourite dog. As of early December, at least 61 people have been prosecuted for insulting the monarchy, according to local human rights group iLaw. Activists arrested In a separate crackdown on dissent, Thai authorities said on Thursday that they arrested four members of an activist group for attempting to carry out a protest over alleged corruption. Sirawith Serithiwat, a student activist from the New Democracy Movement, was taken into custody on Wednesday, and three other members of the group were arrested the next day while protesting outside a police station over Serithiwat's arrest. They were taken to military court to be charged with violating an order banning groups of five or more people from gathering for political purposes. Last month the students were blocked en route to a protest at the multimillion-dollar Rajabhakti Park, a sprawling concrete plaza showcasing seven giant bronze statues of former Thai kings that has been at the centre of corruption allegations by some Thai media and opposition groups.

The king has not been seen in public since January 11 [Jorge Silva/Reuters] Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest reigning monarch, is in an unstable condition after receiving dialysis treatment, the palace has said in a statement. The Royal Household Bureau said on Sunday that the 88-year-old was given some medicine and put on a ventilator to bring his blood pressure back to normal. "The medical team are watching his symptoms and giving treatments carefully because the overall symptoms of his sickness are still not stable," the statement said. Historically the palace has tightly controlled news about his health and it is difficult to ascertain his overall condition. In recent months the palace has begun issuing more regular updates that point to a string of major health issues including renal failure. THE LISTENING POST: Thailand's lese majeste law Over the past two years he has also been treated for bacterial infections, breathing difficulties, heart problems and hydrocephalus - a build-up of cerebrospinal fluid often referred to as "water on the brain". He has not been seen in public since January 11 when he spent several hours visiting his palace in Bangkok. News about the king's health is closely monitored in Thailand, where King Bhumibol is deeply revered. Anxiety over the king's health and an eventual succession has formed the backdrop to more than a decade of bitter political divide in Thailand that has included two military coups and often-violent street demonstrations.

Thais will take part in a year-long mourning period for the late monarch [Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters] Thais should "socially sanction" those who defame the monarchy following King Bhumibol Adulyadej's death , the junta's justice minister has said, amid fresh videos of mob justice against people accused of insulting the institution. The death of the world's longest-reigning monarch on Thursday has left the nation bereft of its key pillar of unity and seen remarkable mass outpourings of grief from black-clad Thais. But it has also fired up small but vocal ultra-monarchist forces, including mobs and online crusaders surfing the web and bent on punishing anyone perceived to have insulted the monarchy.

His message comes amid a growing number of cases of vigilantism by royalist Thais against people accused of insulting the monarchy. At 10:30am a video was broadcast live on Facebook showing a mob kicking and beating a man and forcing him to prostrate himself in apology for allegedly insulting the monarchy. During the beating, which appeared to take place in Chonburi, east of Bangkok, the man cried out: "I didn't mean to do it, I love the king! It's my fault." READ MORE: Remembering Thailand's beloved King Bhumibol Another video widely shared on social media showed an elderly woman on a Bangkok bus being berated by fellow commuters in the presence of police. As she exits the bus, the woman is slapped in the face by another woman dressed in black. It is not clear when the incident took place but the video was uploaded on Monday evening. 'Black-shaming' Thailand's monarchy is protected by a draconian lese majeste law that outlaws criticism with punishments of up to 15 years in jail for each insult uttered. Prosecutions have surged under the military which seized power two years ago, with record-breaking sentences handed down in some cases. That has made detailed discussion or debate about the monarchy's role - and its future after Bhumibol's 70-year reign - all but impossible. WATCH: For Crown or Country: Thailand's Lese Majeste Law The atmosphere in Bangkok has been overwhelmingly sombre and calm since the death of the king. But there has been a rise of angry social media calls by royalists for vigilante action against alleged transgressors of "112" - the criminal code that covers the feared law. On Sunday a woman on Samui island was forced by police to kneel below a portrait of King Bhumibol in front of a baying mob after she allegedly posted an insulting comment about the monarchy on Facebook. She has since been charged with lese majeste. Similar mobs have formed on the southern island of Phuket and in nearby Phang Nga province, prompted by alleged comments.

The latter phenomenon dubbed "black-shaming" has been condemned by the ruling generals. Media inside Thailand, both local and foreign, must heavily self-censor. Authorities, however, struggle to censor critics or media based overseas. But Paiboon said the generals would renew extradition requests for Thais abroad, something that is unlikely to sway governments in countries where lese majeste is not a crime.

Thailand's government has named a former prime minister as regent, who will act as caretaker of the monarchy while the country mourns the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej. There was no official statement on Saturday about the appointment of Prem Tinsulanonda, but as head of the advisory council to the king, he automatically becomes the caretaker until a new monarch is crowned, according to the country's constitution. The 96-year-old Prem, head of the Privy Council, was one of Bhumibol's principal confidants and has ties to Bhumibol's popular daughter, Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn. INSIDE STORY: Is Thailand on its way back to democracy? In an appearance on Friday evening, Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam made the announcement explaining the temporary succession, without mentioning Prem's name. "There must be a regent for the time being in order not to create a gap," Wissanu was quoted by Thai media as saying. Prem, who has been the head of the Privy Council since 1998, has a reputation for clean governance and for favouring compromise over confrontation.

On Thursday, the government unexpectedly announced that Bhumibol's heir apparent, Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, did not want to be immediately named king to give the nation time to mourn his father's death.

In the Thai resort island of Phuket, police and soldiers dispersed a mob of several hundred people seeking a confrontation with a man they believed insulted the country's king. Video shot Friday evening shows the crowd blocking the road outside a soy milk shop and waving placards with slurs such as "buffalo," a local slang word for stupidity. Some shouted for the man to come out. Thai media reported that the crowd's anger stemmed from online comments that were made by the man long before the king's death. Thailand has draconian lese majeste laws that impose stiff prison sentences for actions or writings regarded as derogatory towards the monarch or his family. Bhumibol's death after 70 years on the throne was a momentous event in Thailand, where the monarch has been glorified as an anchor for a fractious society that for decades has been turned on its head by frequent coups.

Police stand guard in front of a limousine which was set ablaze during anti-Trump protests [File: Adrees Latif/Reuters] Two weeks ago, Lacy MacAuley was shocked when she opened her email inbox to find a message informing her that the US Department of Justice had served a warrant to Facebook to access her personal account. "I had heard that Facebook was fighting some warrants, but I certainly didn't give it much thought," recalled MacAuley, a Washington, DC-based activist and prominent anti-fascist. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5038423919001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5038423919001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > FAULT LINES: The Rise of Trump (24:58) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY "I didn't expect that email," she told Al Jazeera by telephone. Three warrants were served that demand Facebook provide the US government with all information from the accounts of two activists and a page affiliated with massive protests against right-wing President Donald Trump 's inauguration on January 20. The requested information includes the entirety of photos, videos, posts, private messages, video calls, billing information and other data between November 1, 2016, and February 9. The other two warrants target activist Legba Carrefour and the "Disrupt J20" page, which has since been renamed "Resist This". MacAuley and Carrefour had been protest spokespersons leading up to the inauguration, and the Disrupt J20 page was a digital space where visitors discussed and organised demonstrations. If successful, the warrant for Disrupt J20 could result in some 6,000 visitors to that page having their names and public and private activity on and with the page passed on to the government. Facebook was barred from informing its users that the DOJ was seeking their online information for seven months. Government lawyers dropped the gag order in mid-September. READ MORE: Anti-Trump protester - 'Is this my last free birthday?' Rights groups have decried the warrants as a "fishing expedition" aimed at creating a database of information on activists who oppose Trump's administration. MacAuley says the warrants are "clearly politically motivated", describing the government's efforts as unnecessary invasions of their privacy. "The government doesn't need to see all the details of my private life," she argued. "[US Attorney General] Jeff Sessions doesn't need to see my family photos, information about my romantic partner and details about my surviving intimate [violence]." Contacted by Al Jazeera, the DOJ and the US Attorney's Office District of Columbia both declined to comment on this story. 'Prosecutorial overreach' Last week, the American Civil Liberties Union's DC chapter (ACLU-DC) filed a motion in court asking for the warrants to be thrown out. MacAuley, Carrefour and Emmelia Talarico, who administered the Disrupt J20 page, are being represented by the ACLU-DC. Scott Michelman, a senior lawyer at the ACLU-DC, described the warrants as "a serious case of prosecutorial overreach". "This is a deep invasion of privacy and it's unconstitutional," he told Al Jazeera. "It's a fishing expedition," Michelman said. "Perhaps what's most chilling is that they permit these activists to be investigated by the very administration they are protesting." The warrants are linked to demonstrations that resulted in the mass arrest of more than 230 people who were at an anti-fascist bloc march during Trump's inauguration. MacAuley, Carrefour and Talarico were not among those arrested. During that march, anti-fascists made their way through the capital's streets. Some of them smashed windows and spray-painted graffiti on walls and vehicles. READ MORE: ACLU sues DC police over violence at anti-Trump rally Police clashed with them, using rubber-coated steel bullets, tear gas and pepper spray. The majority of the more than 230 arrestees were handed a slew of felony charges, most of which are related to rioting and property damage, that could land them behind bars for upwards of 70 years. Among those arrested were protesters, legal observers, medics and bystanders. Although many later had the charges dropped and others reached plea deals with the government, 194 are still facing the charges. Several rights groups accused the police of using excessive force and carrying out indiscriminate arrests during the incident. In June, the ACLU-DC filed a lawsuit against the city, the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and Police Chief Peter Newsham over the police crackdown on January 20. The suit accuses the MPD of making wrongful arrests, violating protesters' constitutional right to free speech, denying detainees from accessing food and water and carrying out invasive body searches. 'Signs of desperation' Sam Menefee-Libey, an activist with the DC Legal Posse, a group that supports the Inauguration Day defendants, argued that the warrants are part of the government's ongoing campaign to dissuade and intimidate anti-Trump activists. "It is a continuation of the US Attorney [Office]'s fishing expeditions, and it has a chilling effect on anti-Trump resistance," he told Al Jazeera. "They're targeting people publicly associated with Disrupt J20 in the lead-up to the Inauguration Day protests … and they are just going after some of the most public figures." In August, the DOJ issued a warrant to the web hosting company DreamHost for information about the operations of the website www.disruptj20.org and an estimated 1.3 million visitors to that page. If the government can lift the lid on Facebook, then we are all vulnerable. Lacy MacAuley, Washington, DC-based anti-fascist activist DreamHost fought that warrant in court. In response, DOJ narrowed the warrant's scope. DC Superior Court Judge Robert Morin subsequently granted prosecutors' request to collect several records from the company, including users' emails and membership lists. "I think that these broad electronic searches are signs of desperation as much as the grossly stacked charges are," Menefee-Libey said. "They're trying to save face in light of the police brutality on Inauguration Day because they know they don't have a case." For her part, MacAuley believes that the warrants are an indication that the US is "in a very dangerous place". "We are in danger of drifting toward fascism and authoritarianism," she said. "If they are targeting us now, who will they come for next? Everyone knows someone who is politically active, and everyone knows someone who has criticised the Trump administration on Facebook," she concluded. "If the government can lift the lid on Facebook, then we are all vulnerable."

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson listens as President Donald Trump holds a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, DC [Reuters/Kevin Lamarque] For a man on the verge of losing his job and blamed for eroding the power of American diplomacy, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is still in the mood for making a jokes. At a recent speech in Washington, DC, before his South Asia trip, Tillerson wished everyone "Happy Diwali," a Hindu festival often marked by fireworks, and then quipped, "I don't need any fireworks. I'm getting too many fireworks around me already". Everyone laughed, including Tillerson himself, and for a good reason. It is easy to find comedy in Tillerson's predicament. He has been accused of calling President Donald Trump a "moron" - something he has not denied. Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has accused Trump of "castrating" Tillerson, an allegation that prompted the secretary of state to declare on national TV, "I checked. I am fully intact." For those keeping track, he is the second Trump appointee who has referenced male anatomy to defend his role in government. However, peel back the spectacle on Tillerson's short tenure and a picture emerges of a Trump administration that is gutting the Department of State, challenging its very reason for existing, pushing aside foreign policy experts in favour of CEOs, and redefining US approaches to diplomacy that will take years to undo, even if Tillerson is ousted. Sources close to Tillerson said he will not survive past January 2018. Even if he leaves sooner, the damage is already done. In September, Tillerson announced plans to trim the State Department's budget by close to 30 percent and cut 1,300 jobs, most of which will come from the civil service. Tillerson wanted to slash more positions but he learned he could not fire government workers so easily. Instead, he decided to keep some positions empty, such as the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism - as well as half of all envoy positions. Other positions remain vacant, like that of the US Ambassador to South Korea - an odd thing, given that the US and North Korea might go to war. {articleGUID} Today, offices within the State Department that write critical reports about human rights , religious freedom, gay rights, and war crimes are shadows of what they once were or shut down altogether, meaning that lawyers and human rights activists who rely on these bureaus will have a much harder time advocating on behalf of vulnerable communities abroad. But Trump is not really interested in a State Department that functions or succeeds. He wants a State Department whose culture is redefined and whose power is diminished so that he can enlarge his own importance - and that of his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Take, for example, the issue of institutional memory within the US diplomatic community. The State Department runs on legacy - carryovers from past administrations of both parties who stick around to ensure US policies have continuity. However, Trump's team told his diplomatic staff not to have contact with Obama's team. That is like taking over a convenience store and covering your ears when the previous owner tries to offer you advice about keeping the place secure. It's a curious thing: Trump has filled his cabinet with people who in many ways would like to see the very departments they head up eliminated. Tillerson is no different. He admitted he did not even want the job and in interviews brags about how much he dislikes Washington, DC. Madeline Albright, a former Democratic Secretary of State under President Bill Clinton, recently said that what worries her about Tillerson is that he does not seem to be enjoying his job. The result is a State Department that is at its weakest in years. During George W Bush's administration, the Department of State was sidelined in favour of the Department of Defense, which led diplomacy when the US waged war on Iraq . But Bush never undermined the State Department by tweeting or kept the State Department out of foreign policy meetings, as Trump is reported to have done with Tillerson's team. After all, Trump seems to question why he needs an expensive apparatus like the State Department when he can convey his thoughts to North Korea's 'Little Rocket Man' directly on Twitter. I worked for a State Department grantee in the early 2000s and while it was tense then between the State Department and the White House, I have never seen a mess like the one Trump created. Partly this is because of who is staffing Trump's government right now. The State Department has always had its share of political appointees from the business world. When I worked in the US Congress, I saw it there, too - this fantasy many business executives have, especially those in the Silicon Valley, that if the government were run like a start-up, it would operate smoother. But working for the State Department requires stomaching a high amount of inefficiency, something many CEOs find unnerving and counterintuitive. Diplomacy is also slow and often involves a lot of setbacks, something both Trump and Tillerson are impatient of, given their mantra that "American should always win." Most of all, working in government requires a degree of accountability that many in the private sector are unaccustomed to, including Tillerson. As the CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson was contemptuous of accountability and he has brought this same ethos to his role at the State Department. Tillerson, I suspect, will argue that he was set up to fail by Trump. In some ways, he has a point. After all, Trump seems to question why he needs an expensive apparatus like the State Department when he can convey his thoughts to North Korea's "Little Rocket Man" directly on Twitter . But Tillerson is not that different from Trump, even though he might suggest otherwise. Both assumed their position without really respecting the responsibilities, the confines, or the histories of their offices. In interviews , Tillerson likes to play the role of the outsider, of someone who does not really understand Washington, DC. That might be true. He does not get Washington, DC. But did he ever try? And does Trump even want the next Secretary of State to try? The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial policy.

Donald Trump says his tax proposal will help middle-class families save money and eliminate loopholes that benefit the wealthy [AP photo/Michael Conroy] What is at least as significant as Trump 's tax plan itself ( pdf ) are the reactions to it. There's some good news. Here is some reality-based analysis. Normally, anybody on the right, and especially in right-wing think tanks, is in favour of any tax cut. That's what right-wing think tanks exist for. Yet, with regards to bringing back overseas money at a super low tax rate, the Heritage Foundation has said in 2011 that such a move , "would, like its predecessor, have a minuscule effect on domestic investment and thus have a minuscule effect on the US economy and job creation". {articleGUID} The last, and only, such tax reparation even demanded specific pledges about using the money for real domestic investment that would create jobs. Forbes (who used to cheerfully call itself a "capitalist tool"), wrote that " 58 companies, which accounted for almost 70 percent of all funds repatriated, slashed nearly 600,000 jobs while saving an estimated $64 billion in taxes". Anyone who looks can find that out. What's fresh is that reality is being reported across ideological lines. Though not across party lines. Looking at the bigger issue, a wide variety of commentators are actually saying that there is "no evidence" or "little evidence" that tax cuts for the rich lead to the positive effects that are promised, growth in the real economy, more jobs, and better wages. That's based on evidence from reality. As such it should be highly praised, even though it's only partway there, like looking out the window at the weather but not flinging open the door and walking out into reality. Here's the full step. There have been five major tax cuts in the last hundred years. All of them have favoured the rich. One of them, in the 1960s, was simultaneous with the launch of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society and the Vietnam War, so there was vast spending that pushed the other way. The other four were followed by great increases in wealth inequality, bubbles, crashes, recessions or a depression (different only by degree, not kind). Three of those four included massive bank failures. Trump's plan is advertised - mostly by Trump - as great for the middle class. Does anyone remember Mitt Romney? {articleGUID} Mitt divided America into "makers and takers". Makers paid Federal Income Tax. Takers were the 47 percent who didn't. It is true that about that many people don't pay Federal income tax . Then comes the sleight of hand. Drop "Federal" and "income," and say nearly half of Americans don't pay "taxes". Mitt, his friends, and supporters said that a lot. It's not true. If you work, you pay Social Security and Medicare. Employees and employers each pay 7.65 percent to Social Security. According to the Tax Foundation, employers simply lower salaries by 7.65 percent to cover it. If you're self-employed, you pay both halves. The maximum taxable earnings are $120,000. The richer you are, the less it touches you. If we're going to name "makers and takers", note that corporate taxes as a portion of federal revenue have steadily declined. Payroll taxes have gone up, replacing them almost exactly, shifting the burden from Mitt Romney to the cleaners and groundskeepers for his five houses. Buy something, and you pay sales tax. Property owners pay real estate, school, water district, sewer district, library taxes, and others. Landlords include that when they calculate rent. Anyone who sins legally pays sin taxes (alcohol, tobacco, marijuana and gambling where legal). There are all sorts of fees from driver's licenses to fishing licenses. If you commit a traffic violation or a minor crime, you will be fined and charged fees. In theory, these are penalties, but lots of jurisdictions use them as a revenue base, so they are, in that sense, taxes, and they are imposed far more on the powerless poor than on the "I've got a lawyer" well-off. A full-tilt reality check would tell us that growth in the real economy (as opposed to the financial sector), with more jobs and higher wages, has been greater with higher taxes on the rich and on corporations. Virtually all tax cut proposals refer primarily to Federal income tax, automatically excluding about 47 percent of the people. If we define the middle class as the literal middle, then up and down a certain distance - it can only be said to affect the upper half of the middle class. If it's a cut for everyone above the breakpoint, then, relatively speaking, it is an increase for those who pay their taxes through all the other means. In fact, the big tax cuts in the 1980s and in the 2000s (during the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George W Bush) were actually tax shifts, demonstrated by the fact that while Federal income tax rates have gone down, especially for the rich, and the effective tax rate on corporation has gone down, the proportion of taxes to the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) has remained fairly steady. One of the oddities is that various analysts include corporate taxes as part of the tax burden of individuals. Some put the burden on the rich since they own virtually all the stocks. Others say it's on labour, pushing wages down. It depends on what they're arguing for, that rich people really do pay a fair share or that cutting corporate taxes will benefit workers. To even debate that hides a fascinating, and perverse, concept. Is a corporation a separate entity? It has rights and privileges and relative immortality. If it is, shouldn't it be taxed separately just as separate people are? Is paying taxes a cost of doing business? The almost universal assumption is that it's not. That would mean that roads, emergency services, police and fire, courts, medical and food supplements to allow low-wage workers to survive, educated workers, educated consumers (so they can read the names on products), borders, and defence, are not costs of doing business. Conversely, if being a corporation does not provide financial advantages greater than the disadvantage of being taxed as a separate entity, why (in a market system making rational decisions) do it? A full-tilt reality check would tell us that growth in the real economy (as opposed to the financial sector), with more jobs and higher wages, has been greater with higher taxes on the rich and on corporations. Actual history tells us that when corporate tax rates have gone down - the official rate or the effective rate - growth has gone down. Whatever the theory says, that's the fact. Cutting the rates for corporations and the rich are invitations to, if not causes of, a new bubble, crash, recession cycle.

An Iranian man reads a copy of the daily newspaper 'Omid Javan' with a headline that reads in Persian 'Crazy Trump and logical JCPOA' [AFP/Getty Images] US President Donald Trump just made the first step to dismantle a deal that took more than four years to negotiate, from the first overtures made by the Obama administration to Iran in 2011 to the final signing of The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2015. Trump is seeking to undo the diplomatic legacy of the previous administration, arguing that the Iran nuclear deal failed to prevent the development of Tehran's ballistic missile programme and end its support for terrorism. Trump ostensibly wants a grand bargain that will cover all of these issues. The irony is that in the past such a grand bargain was put on the table and rejected. Iran itself proposed it in 2003, and it was Trump's Republican predecessor, George W Bush , that failed to pursue it. That failure led to Iran waging a low-intensity proxy war against the US in Iraq . Just as Iran had options then to communicate its displeasure when the US failed to engage with it, so it has now. And all of them would lead to more instability in Iraq and the region as a whole. The 2003 Iranian grand bargain By failing to recertify the Iran deal, Trump bucked the issue to Congress, and it is up to the legislative branch to decide US' commitment to the deal. However, the symbolic nature of Trump's action cannot be undone. From Tehran's perspective, particularly the hardliners , the US is fickle and cannot be trusted. In their eyes, Iranian-US relations have not progressed, but have gone back to the way they were under the Bush administration. After 2001, Bush included the Islamic Republic in what he called the " axis of evil ", which included Iraq and North Korea . In 2003, the US was on Iran's border, having just successfully invaded a member of that "axis". It was in then that Iran offered the US a comprehensive negotiation proposal, where the Islamic Republic was willing to open its nuclear programme for inspections, work as a partner to stabilise Iraq, and cooperate against fighting al-Qaeda , offering Washington then what Trump asks of Iran now. {articleGUID} The response to the offer from the office of Vice President Dick Cheney allegedly was, "We don't talk to evil." When Washington refused to engage with it through diplomacy and collaboration in 2003, Iran decided to undermine US interests in the region. One tool at its disposal was the variety of Iraqi armed groups targeting US forces. Thus, the US had to combat two distinct foes during Iraq's insurgency: al-Qaeda in Iraq (which later morphed into Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) and a set of Iranian proxies. Many of the Shia militias in Iraq today grew out of Iran's low-intensity proxy war against US forces. Tehran's rationale then was that the Bush administration sought regime change and considered bombing Iran's nuclear facilities. The lesson from 2003 is that when the US failed to talk to Iran through dialogue and diplomacy, Iran could talk back through its many armed proxies in the region. This is an option for Iran today, as it was in 2003. Syria and Iraq at stake The commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps already made an implicit threat in response to Trump's aggressive rhetoric against Iran. There are still US forces in both Iraq and Syria and in the Syrian context, Iran and the US are on the brink of a proxy war . Iran has at its disposal the option to escalate the Syrian conflict in response to the actions of the Trump administration. To undermine US interests in the region, Iran can also use diplomacy and continue to wean Iraq away from Washington. The situation in Iraq is precarious, given that the central government has to placate Arab Sunnis that lived under the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ), and reconcile with the Kurdish region that has just voted for independence. ISIL still has the potential to wreak havoc in Iraq, and only a stable government in Baghdad can prevent this from happening. Since 2003, the central government in Baghdad has been an institution contested by the US and Iran, each trying to place their parties at the apex of power. By 2014, Tehran and Washington realised it was in their interest to cooperate in Iraq's domestic politics. They both agreed that the decisive legacy of former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Iraq contributed to ISIL's rise and both states encouraged him to step down for a less divisive candidate, Haider al-Abadi . But this consensus can easily disappear. {articleGUID} Iraq will have new parliamentary elections in 2018. In the wake of Trump's action, Iran can offer financial largesse to parties and candidates that will support its policies, and perhaps unseat Abadi as prime minister. Not only does Iran have a say in the formation of the central government in Iraq, but also has influence over Kurdish parties in Iraq. The US will continue to face difficulties in defusing the diplomatic crisis between Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government, unless Tehran is involved. Whether the Trump administration likes it or not, Iran is a major player in the Middle East and its future stability depends on it. The consequences of not engaging with Tehran and pursuing aggressive policies towards it (as Bush and Cheney did) are very much evident today, not only in Iraq but in the rest of the region.

John F Kennedy prior his assassination [Corbis/Getty Images] President Donald Trump has said he will release all documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy, except those with the names and addresses of people who are still alive. "After strict consultation with General Kelly, the CIA and other Agencies, I will be releasing ALL #JFKFiles other than the names and addresses of any mentioned person who is still living," Trump wrote in a series of tweets, referring to his chief of staff John Kelly. The assassination of President Kennedy has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories. President Trump has said the public has the right to be "fully informed" about the event. President Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, as he rode in a motorcade through the streets of Dallas, Texas, in an open-topped limousine next to his wife Jacqueline Kennedy. Elected in 1960 as the 35th president of the United States, 43-year-old Kennedy became the youngest man and the first Roman Catholic to hold that office. The US government has released 2,800 previously classified files on the assassination, but some documents have been withheld at the request of government agencies. Following the assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, a former Marine and self-proclaimed Marxist, was arrested. On November 24, he was shot dead in the basement of the Dallas police department by Jack Ruby, a local nightclub owner. The shooting was captured live on television. One memo revealed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had warned police of a death threat against Oswald. "We at once notified the chief of police and he assured us Oswald would be given sufficient protection," writes the FBI director J Edgar Hoover.

Trump called the attacker in New York City 'sick and deranged' [Kevin Lamarque/Reuters] A vehicle-ramming attack in New York City has drawn a strong reaction from US President Donald Trump , who called the attacker "very sick and deranged" on Twitter and pledged to step up vetting of those entering the US . At least eight people died and 11 people were injured late on Tuesday after a man drove a rented pick-up truck into cyclists and pedestrians in New York City, before being shot and wounded by police officers. The city's mayor, Bill de Blasio, condemned the attack as "cowardly" and investigators have labelled it a "terrorist" incident. {articleGUID} Local news stations, citing sources in law enforcement, said the attacker, who they named as Sayfullo Saipov, had left a note inside the car in which he pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group ( ISIL ). "We must not allow ISIS to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere. Enough!" The US president tweeted, later adding: "I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program. Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!" In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2017 // <![CDATA[ // ]]]] > Trump's reaction is in keeping with his responses to other attacks when the perpetrators are associated with ISIL. After a non-fatal tube bombing attack in London in September, Trump angrily condemned the suspect as "sick and demented". The US leader was similarly indignant after June's deadly stabbing attack in the British capital, voicing anger at London Mayor Sadiq Khan's response to the killings. At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is "no reason to be alarmed!" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017 // <![CDATA[ // ]]]] > {articleGUID} Similar reactions followed attacks in the Spanish city of Barcelona, and in the French capital, Paris. In all of the cases, the attackers had expressed sympathy for ISIL or were believed to have been associated with the armed group. The usual components found in Trump's responses to the attacks include: strong condemnation of whoever is responsible, an expression of sympathy for those affected, and a call to action in some form. After the shooting attack on police officers on the Champs Elysee in Paris in April, the US president wrote: "The people of France will not take much more of this." Another terrorist attack in Paris. The people of France will not take much more of this. Will have a big effect on presidential election! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2017 // <![CDATA[ // ]]]] > An earlier attack on the Louvre Museum in Paris, drew the response: "GET SMART US" Far-right violence Trump's reactions to attacks perpetrated by the far right, however, take on a starkly different tone, and sometimes do not elicit a reaction at all. When white supremacist James Alex Fields Jr drove his car into a crowd of anti-racist protesters, killing one and wounding 19 others, Trump wrote: "Condolences to the family of the young woman killed today, and best regards to all of those injured, in Charlottesville, Virginia. So sad!" Condolences to the family of the young woman killed today, and best regards to all of those injured, in Charlottesville, Virginia. So sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 12, 2017 // <![CDATA[ // ]]]] > Any condemnation of the attacker or his ideology was absent, and there was no call by the US president to address the issue of rising white supremacism in the US. {articleGUID} In a press conference shortly after the attack, Trump condemned violence on "both sides". While the Charlottesville attack, which was widely labelled a "terrorist attack" by US media outlets, drew a response from Trump, other attacks have not made it to his Twitter feed. Just nine days after Trump assumed the presidency, a gunman shot and killed six worshippers at a mosque in the Canadian city of Quebec. Alexandre Bissonnette, the suspected attacker, had expressed his support for Trump's Muslim ban and white supremacist ideology. The White House later issued a statement offering condolences to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau but Trump's reaction on his Twitter feed was muted, not mentioning the attack at all. There was a similar response in June when a man drove a van into worshippers leaving a mosque in London, leaving one person dead. The White House issued a statement, but Trump's Twitter feed was silent. Trump was also criticised online for his silence when a white supremacist stabbed two men to death in the US city of Portland after they defended two Muslim teenagers he was abusing. {articleGUID} After heavy criticism from his opponents, the US president eventually tweeted a response, which did not include any mention of the attacker's ideology or the issue of rising white supremacism in the US. Trump tweet: "The violent attacks in Portland on Friday are unacceptable. the victims were standing up to hate and intolerance. Our prayers are with them." The tweet was from the official POTUS account , not Trump's personal account , however . Online reaction Trump's critics have seized on his reactions to different attacks as evidence of his alleged propensity for far-right ideas. Under his most recent tweet on the attack in New York, opponents of the US leader accused him of reacting more strongly to attacks committed by Muslims than those by white supremacists. "And where was your extreme gun vetting program after Las Vegas? Oh but wait, we're not supposed to talk politics after events like this," asked one Twitter user named Scott Rodgers, referring to the recent mass shooting in the city, in which 58 people were killed and hundreds others were injured.

RenderPagesVideo('5617239483001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Five years ago, a notoriously profane protest by a female punk band, Pussy Riot, in Moscow's main cathedral sought to satirise the growing rapport between the Russian state and the Orthodox Church, most especially the close regard President Vladimir Putin and the church's spiritual leader Patriarch Kirill have for each other. At the time, this was a relatively fringe concern; most Russians had other things on their minds - such as the country's economic problems, its deteriorating relationship with the West over Syria and the re-election of Putin to the top job after an interregnum as prime minister. But now it's back on the agenda because many of Putin's opponents believe the glowing endorsements and mutual back-slaps the Kremlin and the Orthodox Church give each other these days are contributing to ever more tightly defined social and religious conservatism, intolerant nationalism and a growing personality cult around the president. We had heard that the most obvious outward sign of this close relationship was the proliferation of religious zealotry filling the broadcast airwaves. So we set off for the offices of Tsargrad TV, close to Moscow's Red Square, to meet Alexander Dugin, editor-in-chief of Russia's most ultra-conservative Orthodox channel, which boasts the country's fastest-growing audience. "After the fall of communism, there was a great abyss ..., a void, because everything began to fall down into the black hole. All the certainties, all the truths, all the things that were taken for granted in one moment disappeared," Dugin says. With Putin's help, Dugin explained, the Russian Orthodox Church is filling this void. Indeed, the view as seen through Tsargrad TV eyes is of a Moscow skyline of countless domes and crosses, vying with hammers and sickles - a battlefield of symbols - and its clear which side is winning. The channel's owner, Kremlin-connected investment banker Konstantin Malofeev, was once dubbed God's oligarch, a title he eschews, "I'm God's servant, not God's oligarch ..." he insists perched behind a large portrait of Nicholas II. "We live now in Russia ... a delightful period, a period of triumph of Christianity." Malofeev is clear as to who is responsible. "President Putin is our leader ... given to us by God." Others insist that by moving the Orthodox Church to centre-stage in Russian affairs Putin is merely ensuring the church's support for his conservative and nationalist political agenda - a smart move given that between a half and two-thirds of all Russians identify themselves as Orthodox Christians. Leonid Simonovich-Nikshich from the Orthodox Banner Bearers, whose motto is 'Orthodoxy or Death' [Glenn Ellis/Al Jazeera] Decriminalising domestic violence Next morning, we are outside the Russian parliament, the Duma. In recent years, a raft of socially regressive legislation has merged from this building, often underpinned with backing from the Russian Orthodox Church. One of the most controversial of these laws (passed by 358 voted to two) effectively decriminalises domestic violence, which seems an odd thing for a Christian body to endorse. According to this law, when you beat somebody, you can just pay a fee like a parking fine - the same sum even. It sounds crazy, but it's true. Alena Popova, campaigner Nevertheless, in a statement issued after the law was passed, the church insisted that physical punishment is "an essential right." Campaigner Alena Popova is waiting for us and wastes no time letting us know what she thinks about this law. "According to this law, when you beat somebody, you can just pay a fee like a parking fine - the same sum even. It sounds crazy, but it's true," Popova says. Last year, she tells us 14,000 women in Russia died from injuries inflicted by a relationship partner - equivalent to one woman every 40 minutes. Popova has been lobbying Duma deputies to get the legislation changed but she knows it won't be an easy task - given the amount of support the law had on its passage through parliament. Laws targeting other churches and faiths That evening, we go looking for some of those on the receiving end of another recent ruling, known as the Yarovaya Law - after one of its sponsors. In essence, a set of 2016 amendments to existing "anti-terror" and "extremist" legislation, the law is notable because of the inclusion of new restrictions on evangelism and religious missionary work. According to its provisions, missionary work is defined as: "The activity of a religious association, aimed at disseminating information about its beliefs among people who are not participants (members, followers) in that religious association, with the purpose of involving these people as participants (members, followers). It is carried out directly by religious associations or by citizens and/or legal entities authorised by them, publicly, with the help of the media, the internet or other lawful means." The target of these prescriptions, said the law's detractors, are adherents of churches and faiths other than the Orthodox Church. And that's who we are meeting tonight, a group of Jehovah's Witnesses and their spokesman Mikail Panichev. We run risks when we just talk to someone about the Bible … let alone about our teachings. Any conversation may raise suspicions - they will go and inform the police. Mikail Panichev, spokesman, Jehovah's Witnesses We rendezvous with our go-between at an ill-lit car park in a Moscow suburb and he leads us to nearby housing block. In the lift, our guide pretends not to know us when someone else gets in. We are ushered to a flat where a dozen or so people sit around a table reading the Bible. We are warned that at any moment the FSB (state security) could appear. According to the those at the meeting, the Jehovah's Witnesses, a group once persecuted by the Nazis for their strict adherence to pacifism, have now been labelled a threat to society here, too; driven underground last April when the Russian Supreme Court seized all their property, declaring the group "extremist". Since then, there have been numerous attacks against their homes and places of worship. Most of this small group have already spent time in detention, including a girl in her teens. According to Panichev, "we run risks when we just talk to someone about the Bible … let alone about our teachings. Any conversation may raise suspicions - they will go and inform the police." Since the fall of communism, about 25,000 churches have been built or restored in Russia [Glenn Ellis/Al Jazeera] Midnight raids As our filming continued over the days that followed, it seemed to us that the rise of Russian Orthodox Church was unstoppable. Since the fall of communism, 25,000 churches have been built or restored in Russia with state backing - if not always universal public support. We went in search of one set of opponents who meet every week in a Moscow park. They told us that the land had been set aside for yet another church, which they objected to because it meant taking away a public amenity. But it's risky to openly challenge such developments as Yevegeny Lebedev discovered last November. He told us that his home and those of 11 others were stormed by masked police officers in midnight raids, "They bust in shouting, 'Down on the floor!' Somebody threw me to the floor. I was like that for 20 minutes, my kids crying." The officers were investigating a possible violation of yet another new law, which has the backing of the Orthodox Church. In this case, making it a criminal offence to "insult the feelings of religious believers". The raids were broadcast on national TV and Patriarch Kirill denounced Lebedev and his friends as "Pagans." This now routine use of law enforcement muscle to bolster the status and privileges of the Orthodox Church struck us as deeply ironic, given that only a few decades ago the communists used the same brutal measures to suppress organised religion. In those days, this maxim from the founder of the Soviet state, VI Lenin, would have been at the heart of the state's view of religion: "Religion is the opium of the people … All modern religions and churches, all and every kind of religious organisations are always considered by Marxism as the organs of bourgeois reaction, used for the protection of the exploitation and the stupefaction of the working class." Presumably, back when the Soviet Union still existed and Vladimir Putin was still a loyal KGB officer, he would have wholeheartedly endorsed such thinking as a matter of political expediency, if not personal conviction. But now he's president, he clearly takes a different view - and the Russian Orthodox Church is the beneficiary.

Vasya Kislov, self-portrait with acrylic paint and Photoshop Moscow, Russia - Vasily 'Vasya' Kislov used to attend opposition rallies to protest against President Vladimir Putin's policies. But not any more. He was nine when the meetings started in late 2011, after Kremlin critics and election monitors accused the ruling United Russia party of ballot stuffing and vote rigging. Tens of thousands strong at first, the rallies grew smaller and smaller, as Vasya's disappointment in the protest movement grew. "I don't rule out that [the] opposition will turn into the same form of government [as Putin's]," the lanky, fair-haired 12-year-old boy says seriously when explaining why he no longer tags along with his parents to the rallies.

His father, Daniil Kislov, 50, is a political analyst and publicist who specialises in Central Asia and whose website fergananews.com is banned in ex-Soviet Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Daniil recently returned from London, where a panel of experts and philanthropists discussed the future of a gigantic collection of Soviet avant-garde art in one of the world's most polluted environmental disaster zones. RELATED: Banned Russian art squirrelled away in Uzbekistan Vasya's mother, Anastasia Patlay, 40, is an actress and director at Teatr.doc, one of Russia's most controversial theatres which offers "verbatim" recreations of real-life tragedies such as the story of a Russian lawyer who uncovered evidence of multimillion-dollar fraud by Kremlin-connected tax officials - and died in jail. On the day of Al Jazeera's interview with her son, Patlay was in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, presenting her play on the trial of Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian film-maker in Moscow-annexed Crimea, who was sentenced to 20 years in jail in August on terrorism charges widely seen as trumped-up. Although Vasya knows and likes what his parents do for a living and what they talk about at their kitchen table, he has much bigger things on his mind. He contemplates the survival of mankind amid global warming and the mass extinction of species. He wants to study biology and chemistry and become a great environmentalist, someone as influential as Carl Linnaeus, an 18th-century Swedish scientist who invented taxonomy and contributed to the development of ecology. "I am mostly interested in the structure of living things," Vasya says, sitting on a couch in the tiny kitchen of his family's one-bedroom apartment in a 17-storey concrete building in southern Moscow. The kitchen is filled with the drool-inducing smells of the pork and vegetables his father is cooking according to an Andalusian recipe. A woman can be heard yelling at a crying child from an apartment above. RELATED: Struggle of a Russian Samaritan Unlike the family upstairs and millions of Russian households where domestic violence is chronic, the Kislovs managed to make Vasya's childhood nearly trauma-free. He says his most painful memory is that of a "very bitter" olive he ate when he was six. And there are a lot of olives in his life. His family spends several weeks a year in various parts of Spain. He already speaks fluent Spanish and decent English. He learns to play piano pieces by JS Bach and Edvard Grieg - and considers the day he got a Casio electric piano to be the happiest of his life. But he is more interested in natural sciences - and uses Rutherfordium, the name of a radioactive and artificially created chemical element named after the pioneering British physicist Ernest Rutherford, as his Facebook moniker.

These days, the best-known person in the neighbourhood isn't a murderer, but a novelist. Viktor Pelevin is a reclusive writer of best-selling novels that offer satirical, absurdist and esoteric theories explaining the reality that Russians live in. Vasya's family is also a symbol of Russia in transition. His grandparents on both sides lived in Soviet Uzbekistan at a time when Communist Moscow tried to reform and reshape Central Asia, a Muslim region conquered by Tsarist troops in the second half of the 19th century. Born and raised in Uzbekistan, but educated in Russian-speaking schools, Vasya's parents left for Moscow in the late 1990s, when independent Uzbekistan was going through a painful economic and political transition that made many ethnic Russians feel unnecessary. And as Russia's political climate approaches the temperature of Siberian permafrost, Vasya's parents discuss the possibility of moving to another country with warmer weather and a better government. His mother is part Jewish, and the family has recently secured a right to move to Israel.

Russian reactions to downing of Russian bomber by Turkish air force may hurt Russians more [EPA] Saint Petersburg, Russia - Before starting his one-man rally in front of the Turkish consulate in early December, Timur Bulatov consulted police officers guarding the building in the historic area of Russia's second-largest city. He showed them a photo of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan with Turkey's moon-and-star national emblem turned to the side so that the crescent formed two horns above the mustachioed politician's head. The officers warned Bulatov that a public display of the offensive image would get him arrested. But the bespectacled and outspoken activist of the People's Council, a pro-Kremlin, neo-conservative vigilante group, still posed with the photo - proclaiming Erdogan a "non-Muslim" and "the son of Satan" - and walked on undeterred.

This is despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's own rhetoric. In his national address earlier this month, Putin was very forward about distinguishing between the "back-stabbing" Ergodan and average Turks. "The Turkish people are kind, hard-working and talented," the president said. "I'd like to emphasise, they have to know that we don't [hold] them and part of [Turkey's] current leaders directly responsible for the death of our servicemen in Syria." But it seems like nobody in Russia heard this part of his speech - and paid attention only to Putin's threat that Turkey "won't get away with tomatoes or some restrictions in construction or other industries". "They will regret what they've done many times," Putin said. "We know what to do." READ MORE: Turkey won't lose any sleep over Russia's harsh words Russia-Turkey sanctions? Russian officials, public figures and Kremlin-controlled media surely knew. Within days after the plane's downing, they seem to have started a competition for the harshest anti-Turkish measure, tirade or prank. Turkish nationals throughout Russia have been kicked out of universities, searched, detained, interrogated and had their visas discontinued, Russian media reported. Turkish-owned plants have been searched or ordered to suspend their work, and the customs service started suspending Turkish goods, the reports said. Russia's foreign policies have never been this bad, never. Gennady Gudkov, opposition leader The NTV television network purported that Turkey buys cotton from ISIL-controlled areas and provides them with high-speed internet connections. In other NTV reports, the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL), Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was said to have received medical treatment at a Turkish hospital - and a bearded Greek monk "predicted" that Turkey "will fall into Russia's hands and split into three or four parts". Russia's top brass accused Erdogan's family of buying oil from areas controlled by the ISIL. A group of Cossacks, descendants of frontier warriors that once spearheaded Russia's wars with Turkey, burned Turkish and US flags and rag dolls of Erdogan and Barack Obama. A nationalist Russian politician said that Turkish sweets should be banned because they may cause cancer. Restaurants started removing or renaming anything Turkish from their menus. And Mikhail Turetsky, the head of a popular Russian choir, joked that he would change his last name because it means "Turkish." Georgians, Ukrainians and Tatars Little seemed unusual about the anti-Turkish campaign in Putin's Russia, because in the past decade, massive detentions, deportations and harassment of people from ex-Soviet Georgia, Tajikistan, Poland and Ukraine began right after the Kremlin's diplomatic spat with their governments. The current anti-Turkish hysteria "is not just reminiscent" of these past campaigns, it has "surpassed them" and reflects Moscow's recent conflicts with many former allies and neighbours, said the Russian opposition leader Gennady Gudkov. RELATED: Russia raiding Turkish firms and sending imports back "Russia's policies are now aimed at isolation and confrontation, because one has to try really hard to fall out with everybody," he told Al Jazeera. "Russia's foreign policies have never been this bad, never." The Kremlin is using tried-and-tested propaganda tools to besmirch Turkey and revive the old image of vile Ottomans, archetypal foes of anything Russian. Over the past five centuries, tsarist Russia and Ottoman Turkey were at war a dozen times. Tsar Nicolas called the Sublime Porte a "sick man of Europe" right before the Crimean war that pitted Istanbul and Western powers against Russia in the 1850s.

PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Sergei Aksyonov, Crimea's Moscow-appointed prime minister, reportedly claimed that hundreds of Tatars who studied in Turkish universities and madrassas are potential spies, and promised to rid the peninsula of "Turkish companies, Turkish businesses and public Turkish-Tatar organizations". Mustafa Dzhemilev, a Tatar community leader exiled to Ukraine, said in a statement that the "wild anti-Turkish bacchanal led by Putin has affected" the Tatars on top of other harassments they face under Russian rule. Putin gains, Russia loses Only days after the downing of the plane, Moscow imposed economic sanctions on Turkey that included bans on fruits and vegetables, charter flights and employment of Turkish nationals in Russia. Ankara said it would lose some $9bn, or about 0.4 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) as the sanctions ruined a bilateral trade worth $31bn a year. The Kremlin did not care that the sanctions affected the dinner tables, wardrobes and holiday plans of countless Russians. A vacation in Antalya was the most affordable option to millions of Russians - until the Kremlin banned charter flights and ordered holiday companies to "evacuate" tens of thousands of tourists. A year ago, Turkish fruit and vegetables replaced the European produce Moscow banned in response to Western sanctions over Crimea, and Turkish clothes and shoes have for years competed here with Chinese goods. But these days, there are no more figs or oranges with a star-and-crescent logo on price tags to be found on the shelves of Russian supermarkets - and some businessmen pledge to reduce their purchases in Turkey. "In the nearest future, we will reduce the import of shoes from Turkey," Andrey Pavlov, who owns a network of shoe shops that sold some 500,000 pairs of Turkish shoes in 2014, said in televised remarks. The conflict has also jeopardised the interests of Russia's largest state-run companies for the sake of hurting Turkey by any means necessary. Gazprom, Russia's mammoth natural gas exporter desperate to wean itself off the pipelines across now-unfriendly Ukraine, said in January that it would build a 1,100-kilometre pipeline to Turkey, along with a distribution hub for the European Union. In early December, however, Gazprom suspended the project that otherwise would have given Turkey "economic development, because it's a big construction project, plus a very important role in Europe as a hub, plus discounts on gas", Leonid Grigoriev, a chief Kremlin adviser on energy issues, told Al Jazeera. Rosatom, a state-owned nuclear corporation, stopped the construction of a 20-billion euro ($22bn) nuclear power station in the southeastern Mersin province designed to decrease resource-poor Turkey's dependence on imported energy. MORE on Turkey-Russia relations: Putin's insulting remarks Even the staunchest pro-Putin stalwarts admit that the sanctions hurt Russia more than Turkey. "They are negative for the Russian economy. Moreover, they are negative for Russian citizens," Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst, told Al Jazeera. "Sanctions are not very well thought-out, because their adoption was mostly driven by emotions, but what's there to do? Russia had to respond on the go."

A street vendor shows traditional Russian wooden dolls Matryoshka depicting Donald Trump and Barack Obama at a souvenir street shop in St Petersburg, Russia [Anatoly Maitsev/EPA] Ryazan, Russia - The name Godless Street, a legacy of Soviet-era persecution of religion, did not sound right to some residents of this ancient Russian city. So, historian and publicist Sergei Bizyukin came up with a new one. How about a Donald Trump Street, he thought in late November, days after the American billionaire's unexpected presidential election victory? Bizyukin's online petition - whose motto "Let's make Ryazan great again" mimicked Trump's campaign slogan - had almost 300 votes by early February. "Some saw it as a joke and signed because it was fun, some stood for normalisation of US-Russia ties, and some signed because they don't like the name Godless Street," Bizyukin told Al Jazeera. WATCH: Why do Russians love Putin so much? The petition generated some media buzz amid nascent Trumpomania, an unprecedented trend in Russia where anti-Americanism has for decades been part of the political DNA. No other US president has been seen so positively in a country that challenged Washington's post-WWII supremacy, and where many still think the United States masterminded the 1991 Soviet collapse. The Kremlin's neoconservative and isolationist agenda aligned with many of Trump's anti-liberal, populist postulates, and his appreciation of Russian President Vladimir Putin revived hopes that the US will accept Russia as an equal superpower.

(13:02) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY After a 45-minute-long telephone conversation between the leaders on January 28, the Kremlin and its loyalists beamed with optimism. Putin and Trump agreed to "actively work together to stabilise and develop Russian-American interaction - in a constructive, equal and mutually beneficial basis," the Kremlin said in a statement. It emphasised their agreement to "establish a partnership" to fight the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS), help resolve crises in the Middle East and around North Korea. Words such as "equal" and "partnership" were music to the ears of many Russian politicians. After the 1991 Soviet collapse, the Kremlin complained that the White House treated it like an inferior, minor power. Russia fiercely objected to NATO's expansion in Eastern Europe, Washington's invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and its meddling in the affairs of Western-leaning ex-Soviet nations. "The conversation showed - Putin and Trump lead the world politics now," Alexey Pushkov, an outspoken Russian senator, said in a tweet. "Kiev, Vilnius, Riga, Tallinn, Warsaw, Oslo, Stockholm, NATO are horrified by the results of the Putin-Trump conversation. Getting ready for 'hard times,'" he said in another Twitter post listing Eastern European and Scandinavian capitals whose leaders mistrust Russia after the 2014 annexation of Crimea . Western sanctions over Crimea, along with low oil prices, crippled Russia's economy. Unsurprisingly, Moscow had paid attention to Trump's pre-election suggestion to recognise Crimea as part of Russia and to lift the sanctions. Obamaphobia - derogatory and racist This Trumpomania contrasts starkly with the perennial squall of negative, indecent or outright racist comments that Russian leaders and public figures have made about former President Barack Obama. Initially businesslike, ties between Putin and Obama soured over an array of issues - including Russia's backing of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . Obama cancelled a G-20 meeting in St Petersburg in 2013 and made unflattering remarks about Putin and Russia. Ppolitical analysts have warned that the "bromance" between Putin and Trump may end in a bitter political divorce [Anatoly Maitsev/EPA] He compared the Russian leader to a "bored kid in the back of the classroom". Putin was reportedly "infuriated" by the comment. After Crimea's annexation and amid bloodshed in eastern Ukraine, Obama also called Russia a "regional power" and championed a series of sanctions against Moscow and selected Kremlin officials and public figures. A top Russian diplomat called Obama's policies "Russophobic". "Recently, [Obama's] bad manners and open Russophobia have been supplemented by anger over the election lost by its candidate and an intention to look for those guilty in their loss anywhere but home," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in a comment posted on his ministry's website in mid-January, referring to Hillary Clinton's defeat and claims that Russia organised hacker attacks against the Democratic Party. A flamboyant nationalist leader was far less diplomatic. "Obama should get a D for flunking because of his [performance] as a head of such a huge state as America," Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who heads the ultra-nationalist LDPR party, said in late December. A month earlier, Zhirinovsky told an obscene joke about Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a live show on the national Channel One. The sound of his laughter has become a popular ringtone.

(25:20) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Such statements triggered cruel, politically incorrect jokes that focused on Obama's facial features and skin colour. In April 2016, a confectioner in the Volga region announced the launch of Obamka - a chocolate-glazed ice cream with a depiction of a dark-skinned cartoon character. The factory claimed that the packaging was inspired by a Soviet film about an African boy and denied the name had anything to do with Obama. Nine days before Trump's inauguration, as Obama expanded sanctions against Russia, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova described him and his administration as no less than ungodly. "God created the world in seven days," she wrote on Facebook. "The Obama administration has seven and two more days to destroy it." OPINION: The inevitable Trumputin divorce Saviour of 'unhappy' America? As a result of this Trumpomania, many Russians have warmed up to the US. In January, 49 percent of them were negative about the US, according to the Levada Center, Russia's last independent pollster. A year earlier, the number reached a staggering 81 percent, Levada said . Some Russians even see Trump as a political messiah who will rid the US of liberalism, globalisation policies, and same-sex marriages. "America is an unhappy nation and Trump arrived to make it happy again" was the name of an analytical show aired in late January by Czargrad TV, a neoconservative, Orthodox Christian television network whose shows often feature homophobic, anti-Western, or monarchist figures. On the day of Trump's inauguration, Czargrad TV threw a party with dozens of neoconservative political activists and heads of pro-Kremlin media outlets. One brought along a "triptych" of oil portraits of Trump, Putin, and French ultranationalist Marine Le Pen - the pillars of a new political order in the US, Russia and the European Union, she said. "We see that Barack Obama and his administration have done everything to worsen ties between Russia and the US, to dictate their will to the entire world, to topple the legally elected leaders they don't like," Maria Katasonova, a former member of the United People's Front, an ultraconservative nationalist group, told Al Jazeera. "Trump has said that he will stop the practice of organising colour revolutions, that indeed are coups, throughout the world, and, finally, a dialogue with Russia will be normalised," she added. She missed the fact the "colour revolutions" that triggered the resurgence of anti-Americanism in Putin's Russia took place during former President George W Bush's rule. Moscow accused Washington of organising the 2003-2004 "Rose Revolution" in former-Soviet Georgia and the 2004-2005 "Orange Revolution" in Ukraine, which brought pro-Western leaders to power and undermined Russia's political clout there. Imminent letdown? But not everyone revels in Trumpomania. A top foreign affairs official in the Russian parliament suggested that Trump's political agenda, focused on his "America First" motto, will inevitably clash with Russia's interests. "We definitely should not expect a road covered with roses," Konstantin Kosachyov said in televised remarks in early February. A Moscow-based political analyst warned that the "bromance" between Putin and Trump may end in a bitter political divorce. "I don't understand the euphoria that arose after Trump's election," Alexi Mukhin told Al Jazeera. "Most likely, a harsh disappointment awaits the part of Russian society that sympathises with him."

French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin pose in the gardens of the Versailles Palace following their meeting [Francois Mori/Reuters] On Monday, newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron hosted his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin at the Palace of Versailles. Perhaps trying to add an air of importance to Putin's visit, Russian TV channel RT shared the following curious detail: "Receptions in Versailles are very rare. For example, Nicolas Sarkozy received a guest at the royal palace only once. That was the famous visit of Muammar Gaddafi in 2007." Whether it was just a coincidence or smart political trolling, Macron's decision to meet with Putin in Versailles is indeed important, at the very least it provides for a pertinent analogy to be drawn.

As a result, he faces international sanctions, starts experiencing economic problems, and heightens anti-Western propaganda. Both Putin and Gaddafi walked that path. In Gaddafi's case, we know the end of the story, in Putin's case - we don't yet. Gaddafi accepted responsibility for the Lockerbie tragedy and managed to get the sanctions revoked. He made a few more concessions to the West, including giving up Libya's nuclear programme. Of course, after the beginning of the civil war, the meeting in Versailles did not prevent Sarkozy from becoming a main ally of the Libyan rebels, while the French air force played a key role in Gaddafi's downfall. For Putin, that moment was painful. At the time, Dmitry Medvedev was formally the president of Russia , but Putin made a power play when he publicly criticised a UN Security Council vote on Libya in 2011. Medvedev had given orders for Russia to abstain on the vote, and it did, but this public sparring over the issue was significant. It is possible that this was one of the main factors that pushed Putin to announce a few months later that he would undo his "castling" move and run for president again. OPINION: Macron, Putin and the boomerang effect Today, it is clear that Putin's interpretation of events in Libya goes something like this: Gaddafi showed weakness by conceding to the West, which took advantage of that and, under the pretext of protecting civilians, overthrew him. This is generally how Russian state media presents the Libyan case.

But Monday's meeting in Versailles seemed like one: It looked like an unsuccessful attempt of the prodigal son to return to the international community. Putin's visit was scheduled after his phone call with Macron to congratulate him on his victory, which suggests that it was a Kremlin initiative. At the joint press conference, a reporter for the RT channel reminded the French president that during the electoral race, his campaign headquarters did not accredit RT and asked how he intends to build relations with foreign journalists. Macron did not even try to be diplomatic in his answer: "I have always had an exemplary relationship with foreign journalists, but they have to be journalists. […] When organs of the press spread shameful untruths, they are no longer journalists, they are organs of influence. Russia Today and Sputnik were organs of influence during this campaign and have, on several occasions, produced untruths about me and my campaign. And I considered that they had no place in my headquarters. All foreign journalists, including Russian ones, had access to my campaign." OPINION: Russia's soft warfare This is a concise retelling of what Macron actually said. He repeated himself, and it was clear he was trying to control his anger. It was also clear that Putin – pursing his lips and fidgeting – was listening to something rather unpleasant. Putin likely misinterpreted Macron's decision to accept the visit as an opportunity to restart relations. But it seems that the French president's intent was rather to show that he is not letting personal affront influence his political decisions and diplomacy. In other words, it doesn't seem that Putin met a friend in Paris - as was the case with Jacques Chirac. He wasn't even meeting a partner, which is what Sarkozy was, to some extent. Macron was harder on Putin than Francois Hollande was, Hollande supported the sanctions but would hardly have allowed himself such candour in Putin's presence. Of course, Hollande did not face attacks by Russian hackers or a massive media campaign aimed at discrediting him, and the Kremlin did not openly support his political opponents. As Belgian blogger Nicolas Vanderbiest has established , internet trolls spreading fake news about Macron were linked to RT and Sputnik. There were also clear Russian traces in the metadata of the leaked campaign emails. Putin likely misinterpreted Macron's decision to accept the visit as an opportunity to restart relations. But it seems that the French president's intent was rather to show that he is not letting personal affront influence his political decisions and diplomacy. After the uncomfortable visit to Paris, things are not looking good for Putin. It seems that he will be similarly disappointed in the US , where talk of impeachment is making any rapprochement with Russia impossible. Even his meeting with Donald Trump may not happen after all. We should not forget that Russia has also faced a new wave of protests, which the authorities have suppressed with unprecedented severity. Of course, we cannot talk about a civil war, but in this pre-election year, tensions will inevitably rise. And then the Libyan analogy might resurface yet again in a different light.

This week, more than 1,700 people have been arrested in Russia for taking part in anti-corruption protests. The geographical scope of the protests was vast - there have been arrests in dozens of Russian cities, from Vladivostok in the Far East to Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea. Beside its breadth, what is also significant about this latest mass demonstration is that the severe suppression of the previous one in March, when many of the protesters were slammed with heavy fines and criminal charges, did not really stop anyone from joining. On the contrary, a number of Russian cities that previously did not participate in the protests joined in. This is not the first time mass arrests and prosecutions have taken place in recent years. In response to the protest wave of 2011-2012, Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to "tighten the screws" on legal freedoms. His government introduced repressive laws limiting the freedom of assembly, while the justice system prosecuted a significant number of demonstrators. It seemed at that time that all these measures helped; the protest impetus diminished. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5468407674001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5468407674001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: Russia: More than 1,000 arrested in anti-corruption rallies (2:26) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY In 2017, Putin tried the same method again. After the protests in March, criminal proceedings were launched against a significant number of protesters. So young people who came out into the streets on June 12 were well aware of the risk of arrest and prosecution. And yet they came out anyway. Two different Medvedevs and two different Russias It is quite interesting that both waves of protests (2011-12 and 2017) were connected to Dmitry Medvedev. But these protests were actually connected to two different Medvedevs and they took place in two different Russias. In 2011 Medvedev was associated with the "thaw", which promised changes and engaged the intelligentsia. The price of oil was hitting record highs, the economy was booming and the middle class was growing. That was the revolution of cheated hope: When Putin decided to come back for a third term, all of these people, desiring change, felt cheated. The insolent falsification of results of the parliamentary elections gave the legitimate reason to go out in the streets. OPINION: Russia's new protest generation Today, it is the revolution of desperation. And Medvedev is now associated not with a "thaw" but with pervasive corruption. The protests were triggered by an investigation into Medvedev's alleged corrupted practices published by opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The economic prosperity Russians once enjoyed is all but a fading memory, while the Kremlin stopped feigning moderation. All the talk about common values with the West and liberalism has now been replaced with an aggressive campaign to "expose the fifth column". The attitudes of the protesters also have changed. In the winter of 2011-2012, the opposition marches seemed like a festive walk: People were smiling, walking around with creative posters and children. The majority of those demos were permitted by the authorities and were not violently dispersed. Today there is no festive mood or speeches and the protesters are much more resolute about their cause. The energy and audacity of these protests can be explained by the fact that a new generation has taken charge of them, a generation which does not know Russia before Putin. Indicative of this was the way the negotiations with the Moscow authorities were conducted to obtain permission to hold the march. In the beginning, the authorities said that they were ready to coordinate with the demonstrators, but that they would be allowed to gather only at a square relatively far from the city centre; the request for a gathering on the main Tverskaya Street was rejected. The organisers of the demonstration (Navalny et al) were ready to agree to that, but when they went to the city council, they were told that they wouldn't be allowed to use a screen or any sound equipment. So they immediately cut negotiations. Later the authorities went back on their initial decision and announced that they would allow the demonstrators to have a screen and sound equipment. So negotiations were back on the table. However, a day before the planned demo, the contractor who was supposed to provide the sound equipment, the stage, and the screen, called in and said he wouldn't be able to deliver them because of orders "from above". So then Navalny announced that there would not be a stage at the square and told protesters to "go take a walk on Tverskaya Street". Meanwhile, the authorities decided to deliver to the designated square not only a stage and sound equipment, but also people to speak on it. That way state channels were able to shoot the scene and show to their viewers that no one showed up to the march. And this was just the beginning of a bizarre surrealistic comedy. The NKVD vs the Golden Horde In that very place and at the very time when protesters were supposed to gather (2pm at Tverskyaya Street), the city council organised a historical reconstruction so the whole place was full of people wearing costumes of various epochs. Among them were people wearing the uniform of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), the same organ that was responsible for mass repression in Stalinist times . When protesters started their march on Tverskaya Street, the "NKVD men" would detain them and hand them over to the police. And in the middle of this insane panopticon, different epochs merged into one place and time and unwittingly this became a scene of profound symbolism: The history of Russia is not just history of dictatorships and repressions, but also of unity and liberation from an oppressive yoke. OPINION: Under surveillance in Russia The energy and audacity of these protests can be explained by the fact that a new generation has taken charge of them, a generation which does not know Russia before Putin. Only in Moscow, according to the official numbers, more than 130 minors were arrested during the protests, while the majority of the detainees are up to 25 years of age. They don't watch TV and they choose their sources of information on their own; they are therefore immune to the traditional Kremlin propaganda. And beside that, young people in general are braver, less likely to compromise and less susceptible to cynicism.

But today it is unable to do even the latter. Attempts to taint Navalny and other leaders of the protests have not produced any reaction among the youth other than new sarcastic memes on social media. The attempt of the Kremlin to get into memes and spread its own only confused people. Of course, the fact that the first attempt to suppress the "youth revolution" was not successful doesn't mean that Putin's regime is doomed and will fall soon. We know many examples when much bigger protests that relied on the youth were stifled by state regimes ( Iran , Egypt, Turkey). But it is also true that the current level of repression doesn't work and won't work. So as presidential elections are fast approaching, Putin is facing a painful dilemma. He will have to either tighten the screws even more and try the resilience of the youth, or surprise everyone and play the "successor" game again. The second option is still feasible, but it seems that the first one is more likely. Roman Dobrokhotov is a Moscow-based journalist and civil activist. He is the editor-in-chief of The Insider.

Polar bear Felix predicts the result of the US presidential election at the Royev Ruchey zoo in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, Russia, on November 7, 2016 [Reuters/Ilya Naymushin] On Thursday, the US Congress passed a bill that in effect ranks Russia along with Iran and North Korea as US top enemy and limits President Donald Trump 's ability to lift sanctions against Moscow. New tougher sanctions were also voted in. Some analysts have characterised this latest development as the return of the Cold War, while pro-Kremlin commentators have made analogies with the McCarthyism era - both are major exaggerations. But the new legislation is important because it makes Russia again a formal enemy of the United States exactly 30 years after Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan signed a breakthrough treaty on eliminating short and medium-range nuclear missiles, putting an end to the arms race.

In the imaginary world which Russian state TV projects into the heads of Russian citizens, there have been two major world powers competing all along - America (and its submissive satellite - the EU ) and Russia, which stepped back on its feet thanks to Vladimir Putin . If someone told Russians that up to 2016 the US and Western Europe did not even notice Russia, they would take this as an insult and refuse to believe it. For a long time, this image of the world which Russian media was propagating was seriously schizophrenic. While TV channels were broadcasting vicious anti-West propaganda, Russia was participating in joint military exercises with NATO, was allowing the US to use its bases for the war in Afghanistan , was hosting the G8 summit in St Petersburg and was pursuing WTO membership. But gradually the imaginary world in Russian domestic propaganda started becoming reality - Russia started sinking deeper and deeper into economic and political isolation, and eventually, the West came to consider it a threat again. It is a bit like the plot of the film Wag the Dog, in which a war in Albania made up to save a failing presidency in the US turns into a real one. But while in Russia, reality and a media-crafted image of the world are gradually converging, in the West they are diverging. In the US and Europe , it seems, they indeed believe that Russia must be addressed as a serious threat, like the USSR in the past. But is Russia really a threat to the West? As outrageous as Russia's attempts to interfere in US elections may be, they had very little effect. What is worrying about the 2016 US election is not external interference, but the fact that millions of American citizens blindly accepted Trump's primitive populist slogans. Any comparison between Russia and the USSR today is comical. The Soviet Union was a poor country, but it regardless was the leader of the socialist camp. USSR satellites and allies made up half of the world. Today, Russia's GDP makes up only 1.5 percent of the world's and its allies number exactly 10 countries (as per the vote on the UN resolution on the annexation of Crimea ). Two of those are former Soviet countries (Armenia and Belarus ) and the remaining eight are Bolivia , Venezuela, Zimbabwe, North Korea, Cuba , Nicaragua, Syria and Sudan . The one thing the 10 have in common is massive poverty and internal instability problems. Russia is behaving, like before, more aggressively on the international scene. But the influence of a country is measured in its ability to achieve its political goals. And what has Russia achieved in recent times? Let's take for example the cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns supposedly organised by the Kremlin. The fingerprints of hackers linked to GRU, the Russian military intelligence directorate, were found in the attack on French President Emmanuel Macron's email and in the attempt to break into voting machines in the US. The same hackers are also accused of attempts of breaking into government servers or other major political institutions in almost all other European countries. It is also known that these hackers have been engaging with the Kremlin's "troll factories" which spread disinformation on social media networks. But is there any evidence that these cyber campaigns have any effect? A typical example is the elections in France . Hackers successfully broke into Macron's email and trolls actively spread fake evidence of offshore accounts, while his opponent Marine Le Pen was backed by Russia. And how much did this help her? READ MORE: Russia - a resurgent superpower? In the US, they are still complaining about Russia's intervention in their elections. Russia, of course, tried to intervene, but all fake news that was spread in the US before the elections (such as Pizzagate and the story of Hillary Clinton's "sickness") were made up by US conspiracy theorists who didn't need any support from the Kremlin to spread them. Hackers could not really take control of voting machines on a large scale. And as for the meetings of Donald Trump's election campaign staff with suspicious Kremlin-linked individuals, did they actually help him? Even if Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya passed on any information on Hillary Clinton allegedly receiving "illegal donations" for her campaign, it clearly did not amount to much, or else Trump would have used it as a "kompromat".

What is worrying about the 2016 US election is not external interference, but the fact that millions of American citizens blindly accepted Trump's primitive populist slogans. In the end, did Russia benefit in any way from Donald Trump's victory? Clearly, relations have deteriorated even further and Russia has received no dividends out of its interventions in Ukraine and Syria. In fact, sanctions are getting worse. It is the same situation with many other countries where Russia tried to interfere with domestic politics. In Central and Eastern Europe, and in the Balkans, Russia is actively sponsoring far-right parties. But despite these financial transactions, Russia has not gained popular approval in any of these regions. In Montenegro , GRU tried to organise a coup so it stops the country's accession to NATO . The coup failed and in fact strengthened pro-NATO attitudes among Montenegrins. Their parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of NATO membership. Vladimir Putin might be very happy about appearing on the covers of international magazines more often than The Beatles at the peak of their career, but we have to admit that he doesn't really deserve all that attention. Russia will not be a real threat to the West as long as all of its institutions (including military and intelligence) are corrupt to the core, as long as their employees are buying villas in Biarritz and sending their children to British and US universities, and as long as its economy depends on its oil and gas being sold to Europe. Actually, Russia gets to understand the extent of its dependence on the West very soon, when Trump signs Congress' bill into law and the new sanctions hit Russian energy companies and their projects in Europe. It is quite ironic that Trump is in a way forced to sign this bill very much because of the growing accusations of collusion with Russia. By forcing the West to believe that it constitutes a real threat, Russia, in the end, might face a very real response. And that the Kremlin will not enjoy.

Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with US President Donald Trump during the their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg [Reuters/Carlos Barria] A first date is always awkward. And indeed Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin's first official meeting was exactly that: awkward. It's likely that other participants in the G20 summit also had uncomfortable encounters with Trump and Putin - two of the least popular world leaders (according to a recent Pew poll , they enjoy respectively 22 and 27 percent support internationally, while Angela Merkel by comparison - 42 percent). And it was entertaining to watch the G20 leaders gathering and chatting amicably, while Putin and Trump went straight to their respective seats, faces buried in their papers, in intense preparation for their speeches. But even more interesting was the long-awaited personal meeting between the two. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5496838001001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5496838001001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: US and Russia agree on new Syria ceasefire deal (3:24) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The day before, Trump had surprised many by visiting Warsaw (the capital of Poland , where Putin enjoys about four percent support) and denouncing Russia 's interference in the domestic affairs of Eastern Europe. During his speech there, he referred to Poland's fate in the beginning of World War II when both Germany and the USSR invaded it. This historical fact is as important to the Poles and their national memory, as it is painful to today's Russian authorities (political commentators close to Kremlin like to interpret this fact as the USSR saving Poland from Nazi invasion). In other words, Trump's speech in Poland was supposed to demonstrate that despite all speculation, the US would continue to back its European allies and defend them from Russian aggression. In this sense, Putin's showing up at the G20 and meeting Trump produced the same discomforting feeling as when the ex-lover of the bride shows up to her wedding. And this uncomfortable sentiment only increased as the meeting went on. In the beginning, their meeting was supposed to last only a half-hour, but it stretched to two, and even Melania Trump was not able to put an end to it. After the encounter, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson described it as "clear positive chemistry". Indeed Putin does know all about chemistry (you can ask Syrian civilians and the relatives of Alexander Litvinenko about that), but Trump could not have continued the bromance, even if he wanted to, for the risk of facing more criticism at home. OPINION: Trump - Putin's best frenemy Especially awkward was the conversation on the cyberattacks of last year. After the meeting, Tillerson told journalists that Trump and Putin had a "very robust and lengthy exchange on the subject", and that Trump "pressed President Putin on more than one occasion". In response, Putin asked for proof that the cyberattacks were linked to Russia and denied involvement, according to Tillerson's words. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, however, related this exchange a bit differently: "US President Donald Trump (and I'm sure either he or Secretary of State Tillerson would say this themselves) said that this campaign has acquired a rather strange character, because these accusations have been raised for so many months, despite no evidence being put forward. […] US President Donald Trump said that he has heard Putin's clear statements that this is not true and that the Russian authorities did not meddle in these elections. He said that he accepts these statements. " Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5498183209001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5498183209001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: G20 - Trump left isolated on climate change (2:46) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY A bit later Putin himself declared that Trump has agreed with his arguments that the Kremlin has no relation to hackers attacking the US. Meanwhile, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley interpreted the situation differently: "What [Trump] did was bring up right away the election meddling, and he did that for a reason. One, he wanted him to basically look him in the eye, let him know that yes, we know you meddled in our elections," she said in an interview with CNN. When asked why the US president would not himself confirm that, she answered: "You can ask him." Regardless of who's presenting more accurately the truth, Putin's meeting with Trump differs clearly from others he has had with state leaders, like for instance that with French President Emmanuel Macron (who was also the victim of a hacking campaign). After the meeting Macron was tough on Russia Today journalists and the Russia-sponsored misinformation campaign. Trump, himself, made a very terse comment about the encounter, describing it as a "tremendous meeting" and then later on tweeted "I strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it. I've already given my opinion..." But beyond the hacking discussions, did the two leaders manage to agree on anything? According to Lavrov, the two presidents agreed on the creation of a de-escalation zone in southern Syria , where starting July 9 there will be a formal ceasefire. Russia and the US took it upon themselves to ensure that all armed groups abide by it. This is not much of a positive development for Syria, since it is only a local ceasefire covering a small part of the country. It is also doubtful that Russia and the US will be able to make sure it is observed. By contrast, more important substantial questions, such as the establishing of no-fly zones, were not really addressed. Although the meeting ended with nothing achieved on both sides, Putin still came out as the winner. For him, the meeting itself was more important than the result. On the question of Ukraine , the US announced the appointment of a special representative to help resolve the crisis. Apart from that, the two sides agreed to establish a communications "channel" between Russia and the US to regulate the application of the Minsk agreement. In other words, there was no positive progress on the Ukraine question either. In the end, the US and Russia agreed to create a bilateral working group to focus on cyberthreats, according to Lavrov's words. That coming after Washington's hacking accusations sounds like a mockery. It's a bit like: "You stole my purse, give it back!" - "You don't have evidence that I did it!" - "OK then, let's cooperate on fighting against petty thieves." For objectivity's sake, we should admit that Trump is not the first US president to fall into this trap. Barack Obama , who started his presidency by criticising Russia's human rights violations, ended up creating a US-Russia working group on civil society in the late-2009. The group was headed by Michael McFall on the US side, and on the Russian - by Vladislav Surkov, the same man who in the Kremlin is responsible for the suppression of the opposition and control of civil society (clearly, this working group did not usher in a democratic episode in Russia). Although the meeting ended with nothing achieved on both sides, Putin still came out as the winner. For him, the meeting itself was more important than the result. The leader of the most powerful country in the world shook his hand and agreed with him on a few inconsequential policies prompting not a word of public criticism. Clearly, this is a form of international legitimisation, which was badly needed after all the hacking scandals, the war in Ukraine, and the chemical attack in Syria. Footage from this meeting was broadcast on Russian TV channels 24 hours, as if it were a final game in the World Cup we had just won. The question whether this meeting will have any international consequences still remains. Trump and Putin continue to be the least trusted world leaders who are failing to control the situation in Syria, failing to resolve the crisis in Ukraine and in general do not really have much to cooperate on. Trump cannot really revoke the sanctions against Russia (the Congress would not allow him to) and he'll continue to avoid this topic. And Putin does not have much to offer either. All that said, Russian TV propagandists will have to resign themselves to the fact that criticising Trump on air is still forbidden. Roman Dobrokhotov is a Moscow-based journalist and civil activist.

Demonstrators walk down Tverskaya Street towards the Kremlin during an unauthorised opposition rally called by Alexei Navalny in downtown Moscow on October 7 [AFP/Mladen Antonov] "Putin - thief!" were the chants Vladimir Putin had to hear on his 65th birthday. On Saturday, a crowd of mostly young people gathered under the Kremlin's walls and on Tverskaya Street in central Moscow demanding that opposition leader Alexei Navalny (currently under arrest) be allowed to run in the presidential elections. Protests were held in dozens of other cities in Russia ; some ended peacefully (like in Novosibirsk), others with mass arrests (like in St Petersburg). In Moscow, this time there were very few arrested (all were released without charges) - either because the authorities didn't expect so many people to show up that day they or because in advance of the 2018 FIFA World Cup , they are trying not to spoil their image. It seems that football has become the leading guarantor of the Russian constitution.

It's not important that Putin has not yet officially announced whether he would be running, and it's not important that the Central Electoral Commission has already said that it will not allow Navalny to run (because of a conviction in a criminal case, which human rights defenders and the opposition have called fabricated). All this is not important because Russian elections are not like elections elsewhere where candidates compete. Of course, in March 2018, when the elections are scheduled, there will be a formal choice between candidates. The majority of the people who will appear on the 2018 ballot have been "sparring partners" in elections since the 1990s (when the majority of Saturday's protesters hadn't even been born or were still in kindergarten). Real opposition candidates have not been allowed to run for the presidency for many years now, which has led some commentators to say that elections have now lost meaning in Russia. But that's not really the case. The presidential elections in Russia are very important; it's just that they are conducted in the street and not at ballot stations. If you take a look at the recent waves of protests in Russia, they always start just before the elections. That was the case, for example, with "the march of the dissenting" in 2007-2008, which was the first major protest in years to take place in a number of big cities. The scale of the demonstrations came as a shock not only to the authorities, but also the protesters themselves. Then there was another wave of protests in the winter of 2011-2012 which drew even larger crowds. Some 100,000 people gathered on Saharova Boulevard in Moscow and demonstrations were held in almost all regions of the country. And again, neither the government nor the opposition actually expected such crowds. In the following few months, it seemed that the Kremlin's grip on power had started to shake. Dmitry Medvedev, then formally the president, announced liberal reforms and state TV started inviting opposition leaders to speak on air. But immediately after the elections, the Kremlin rolled back the changes and tightened the screws again. And now there is another wave of protests, and there is no reason to believe that it would be any weaker than the previous ones because old problems remain unresolved; the economic crisis continues, and the state of rights and freedoms in the country has worsened. In fact, there are seven factors which indicate that this wave will be even more powerful than previous ones. Internal unity . Earlier, dozens of different small movements and parties were organising protest activities, and it was difficult for them to coordinate - they had different ideological views and were always bickering about political and organisational questions. This is now in the past. Who is "leftist", "nationalist", or "liberal" has been set aside because the main fight is against corruption , dictatorship and the absence of open political competition. A new generation . This year's protesters - compared with those of 2007-2008 and 2011-2012 - are remarkably younger. The majority of them are university and high school students. They actively use the internet and don't watch TV, so they are immune to state propaganda. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5546284929001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5546284929001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > Crimea's Tatars allege systematic Russian oppression PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The year 2017 . One of the chants at Saturday's protests was "Down with the tsar!" This year's 100th anniversary of the 1917 Revolution has a peculiar psychological effect. All the historical discussions and projects dedicated to the revolution have made parallels between Putin's regime and Nicholas' II monarchy inevitable. Active regions . The opposition in the past was never able to develop wide networks outside of Moscow and St Petersburg. Some parties did have regional representation, but it was mostly superficial and ineffective. Today, a strong opposition network exists in the regions - Navalny's campaign offices. Judging by the fact that thousands show up to his rallies in cities across Russia, this network is in fact quite active and effective. Putin has gotten old . When Putin came to power, his supporters were praising him as a young and energetic leader, while state propaganda was pushing pop hits by young girls singing about wanting a man " like Putin ". Today, Putin is 65 and at the end of the next presidential term (if he has one), he will be 71. The propaganda machine continues to organise topless photo sessions and hockey games, where he scores goals against professional hockey players. But today, all of this is just an infinite source of jokes and internet memes. And we all know that that which you laugh at, you cannot fear. Available political alternatives . In the past, the Kremlin actively supported the slogan "If not Putin, then who?" suggesting that whatever other alternative candidates there were for the president, they were all worse. It worked because the opposition was divided and there was no leader who enjoyed overwhelming popularity - the Kremlin was organising effective discrediting campaigns against opposition politicians. Today, any attempt at discrediting Navalny actually works in his favour and boosts his popularity. Network structure of protest . Paradoxically, the rise of a popular leader did not lead to a "personality cult" within the opposition. To the contrary - it led to the creation of networks which are able to act independently of leaders. The authorities have started court cases against many of Navalny's top associates and before major protests, they are regularly arrested. That has not harmed the effectiveness of the protests because the networks are strong enough to proceed with activities in the absence of their leaders. So will there be a new revolution in 2017? On both sides of the barricades, there is little belief that a revolution is possible at this time. Yet, it is worth remembering Vladimir Lenin's hasty prediction "We, the elderly, might not live to see the decisive battles of this impending revolution."

The use of chemical weapons in Syria is a red line for France and "would result in reprisals", President Emmanuel Macron said after meeting his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Monday. Meeting Putin for the first time, Macron told a news conference that France and Russia must cooperate to "eradicate terrorist groups" in Syria and did not directly criticise Moscow's role there. France and Russia back different sides in the Syrian conflict, with Putin supporting President Bashar al-Assad and Macron part of a western coalition that supports rebel groups and has accused Assad of using chemical weapons in the past.

"We need strong cooperation because we have a joint priority, which is the fight against terrorism." Macron said he wanted Paris and Moscow to bolster intelligence sharing on Syria and to work together on finding a political solution to the conflict, but gave no details on what a political deal might look like. Sounding less forthcoming, Putin said he wasn't sure if France's Syria policy was "independent" because it was part of a US-lead alliance, adding that Paris and Moscow had points of disagreement and agreement over Syria. Putin said he and Macron had agreed the fight against terrorism was their top priority, but stressed that he hadn't changed his views on Syria. Macron's warning of French retaliation in the event that chemical weapons are used echo the line taken by US President Donald Trump, who in April ordered cruise missile strikes in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack that Washington blamed on Damascus . "Any use of chemical weapons would result in reprisals and an immediate riposte, at least where France is concerned," Macron said, standing next to Putin in the Versailles palace outside of Paris. Ukraine summit Both leaders called for an informal summit on Ukraine in the so-called 'Normandy Format' - a diplomatic group to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine made up of Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine.

Human rights, rule of law The Russian president tried to shrug off allegations that Russian hackers infiltrated Macron's presidential campaign. "Maybe they were Russian hackers, maybe they were not," he said, dismissing the claims as unsubstantiated. Macron, for his part, expressed anger at reports by pro-Kremlin media during the election questioning his sexuality and links to high finance. He took aim at the Russia Today broadcaster and Sputnik agency, calling them "organs of influence and propaganda". The French president also referred to the repressive situation for gay people in Chechnya and that of NGOs in Russia. Macron told the media that Putin assured him multiple steps had been made to investigate claims of violence against gay people in Chechnya. "I have made President Putin very well aware of what France’s expectations are", Macron said. SOURCE: News agencies Europe France Emmanuel Macron Vladimir Putin Syria's Civil War
President Vladimir Putin attends an International Economic Forum in St Petersburg on Friday [Sergei Savostyanov/EPA] While other world leaders have strongly condemned President Donald Trump's decision to abandon the Paris climate accord, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he won't judge. "Don't worry, be happy," Putin quipped on Friday after being asked for his reaction at an economic forum in St Petersburg, Russia. He said the climate deal doesn't formally go into effect until 2021, giving nations years to come up with a constructive solution to combating global warming. For Putin, leader of the world's biggest crude oil producer and fifth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, there was plenty to cheer in Trump's rejection of the agreement painstakingly negotiated by the Obama administration and signed by 195 countries.

Russia's voluntary reduction goals under the deal are among the weakest submitted by any country, potentially allowing it to spew more planet-warming emissions in future years, not fewer. Russia pledged to reduce its carbon emissions by at least 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. That gives Putin lots of wiggle room because the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s triggered the collapse of the country's centrally planned economy, greatly reducing carbon emissions in subsequent years. Russia also insisted in its Paris submission that it be given the maximum potential credit for carbon absorbed out of the atmosphere by Siberia's vast undeveloped forests. Under current projections, Russia could step up its carbon emissions and still claim to meet its 2030 goals. That gives Putin's government little economic incentive to invest in green technologies. There are currently no utility-scale wind turbines or solar farms in Russia, which - like the US - continues to gets most of its electricity from burning fossil fuels. READ MORE: Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump discuss mending ties Vladimir Chuprov, who tracks the Russian energy industry for the environmental group Greenpeace , said hardliners in the Kremlin will be buoyed by Trump's decision.

"Trump's decision signals business as usual." While Trump has claimed that evidence of global warming is partly an elaborate hoax, Putin agrees with the overwhelming consensus of scientists that climate change is being driven by man-made carbon emissions. "Pressure on the ecosystem is increasing, and as a result of human action and as a result of natural processes, these questions require deep study, research and analysis," Putin said. "It is clear that when working out our politics, our inclusive line of action, we must be responsible and effective." Still, Putin lamented that it was still so chilly and rainy in Russia, joking that future responsibility for the effects of global warming could be pinned on Trump.

Russia's electoral body has announced that Alexei Navalny, the o pposition leader, is barred from challenging President Vladimir Putin in next year's elections. In a statement released on Friday, the Central Electoral Commission said Navalny is "not eligible to stand for office" because he is currently serving a five-year suspended sentence for embezzlement.

"According to the constitution, any citizen who is not in prison is eligible to stand for public office," he said. Navalny ran in the 2013 Moscow local elections, coming second against a Kremlin-backed incumbent with a Western-style campaign and a message of snuffing out corruption . Navalny was allowed to compete in that race as he was appealing his first 2013 conviction. The European Court of Human Rights last year quashed the verdict, saying Navalny and his former business partner did not have a fair trial. Navalny and his supporters condemned the trial as politically motivated. The Russian court held a retrial this year, issuing the same sentence. A regional court later upheld the sentence.

Signing a bill that penalises Russia's alleged election interference marks a significant shift for Trump [Jonathan Ernst/Reuters] US President Donald Trump approves of a bill imposing fresh sanctions on Russia and is ready to sign, the White House said. Trump's willingness to support the measure is an acknowledgement that he has yet to sell his party on his hopes for forging a warmer relationship with Moscow. In a statement late on Friday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump had "reviewed the final version and, based on its responsiveness to his negotiations, approves the bill and intends to sign it". Trump's decision followed negotiations on "critical elements" of the bill, Sanders said, without specifying what those elements were. READ MORE: Russia - A resurgent superpower? Moscow has already retaliated , ordering the United States to cut hundreds of diplomatic staff and closing the US embassy's recreation retreat. The bill passed Congress with overwhelming support on Thursday, dashing Trump's stated hopes for warmer ties with Russia. The proposal was in part a response to claims by US intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 US presidential election , and to further punish Russia for its annexation of Crimea in 2014. It bars Trump from easing sanctions against Russia unless he seeks congressional approval. Strong bipartisan support Trump had privately expressed frustration over Congress' ability to limit or override the power of the president on national security matters, the Associated Press news agency reported, citing anonymous Trump administration officials. But faced with strong bipartisan support in the House and Senate, the president had little choice but to sign the bill into law. Still, approving a bill that penalises Russia's alleged election interference marks a significant shift for Trump. He has repeatedly cast doubt on claims that Russia sought to tip the election in his favour. The 184-page bill seeks to hit Russian President Vladimir Putin and the oligarchs close to him by targeting Russian corruption , human rights abusers, and crucial sectors of the Russian economy, including weapons sales and energy exports. It also imposes financial sanctions against Iran and North Korea. Meanwhile, some European countries expressed concerns that the measures targeting Russia's energy sector would harm its businesses involved in piping Russian natural gas. Germany's foreign minister said his country would not accept the US sanctions against Russia being applied to European companies. A European Commission spokesman in Brussels said the bloc would be following the sanctions process closely. SOURCE: News agencies US & Canada United States Russia Donald Trump Vladimir Putin
RenderPagesVideo('5512284687001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a previously undisclosed conversation during a dinner for G20 leaders at a summit earlier this month in Germany , a White House official said on Tuesday. The two leaders held a formal two-hour bilateral meeting on July 7 in which Trump later said Putin denied allegations that he directed efforts to meddle in the 2016 US presidential election. Trump's interactions with the Russian leader were scrutinised closely because of those allegations, which have dominated his first six months in the White House, and Trump's comments as a presidential candidate praising the former KGB spy. Trump and Putin first met at the G20 during a gathering of other leaders, which was shown in a video. They later held the bilateral meeting, which was attended briefly by a pool of reporters. OPINION: Trump and Putin - An awkward first date In the evening, both men attended a dinner with G20 leaders. Putin was seated next to US first lady Melania Trump. The US president went over to them at the conclusion of the dinner and visited with Putin, the official said. That conversation had not been previously disclosed. "There was no 'second meeting' between President Trump and President Putin, just a brief conversation at the end of a dinner. The insinuation that the White House has tried to 'hide' a second meeting is false, malicious and absurd," the official said. In a tweet late on Tuesday, Trump said: "Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is "sick." All G 20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!" 'A breach of national security protocol' News of the conversation, first reported by Ian Bremmer, the president of political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, could raise renewed concern as congress and a special counsel investigate allegations by US intelligence agencies that Russia interfered to help Trump, a Republican, win the presidency. Trump says there was no collusion and Russia denies interference in the election.

The lack of a US translator raised eyebrows among other leaders at the dinner, said Bremmer, who called it a "breach of national security protocol". Al Jazeera's Heidi Zhou-Castro, reporting from Washington, DC, said the White House was trying to downplay the encounter as a conversation over dessert, rather than a meeting. "But the reason that this has stirred up so much attention is because the relationship between Putin and Trump is under close scrutiny. The US intelligence agency has determined that Moscow attempted to interfere with the US election in favour of Donald Trump, and now multiple entities are investigating whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia," she said. "Now, the revelation about this 'meeting', which was not revealed until now, adds to the perception that Trump and Putin may have a closer relationship than previously thought." OPINION: Why Trump's foreign policy is dangerous The White House official said the leaders and their spouses were only permitted to have one translator attend the dinner. Trump sat next to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's wife. His translator spoke Japanese. "When President Trump spoke to President Putin, the two leaders used the Russian translator, since the American translator did not speak Russian," the official said.

PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY A US official who was briefed by some of his counterparts about the encounter said some of the leaders who attended the dinner were surprised to see Trump leave his seat and engage Putin in an extended private conversation with no one else from the US side present. "No one is sure what their discussion was about, and whether it was purely social or touched on bilateral or international issues," the official said. Lawrence Korb, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, told Al Jazeera that other world leaders would likely look at this encounter and try to get Trump on his own in the future to have this kind of private conversation. "Because they can get him to commit to things that, on the surface, may sound reasonable, but when you dig underneath you find out really that this is against American interests," he said. "The relations with countries are very complicated, nations don't have permanent friends or enemies - they have permanent interests. And so, we don't know what Putin was able to get [Trump] to agree to ... those are the type of things that I think the diplomats rightly worry about."

Russia said the US had until September 1 to reduce its diplomatic staff in Russia to 455 people [Alexei Nikolsky/RIA Novosti/Kremlin/Reuters] Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia will expel 755 US diplomatic staff and could consider imposing additional measures against the United States as a response to new US sanctions. Putin said in an interview televised on state television on Sunday that he ordered the move because he "thought it was the time to show that we're not going to leave that without an answer". He, however, ruled out any immediate measure against the US. "I am against it as of today," Putin said in an interview with Vesti TV. Moscow ordered the US on Friday to cut hundreds of diplomatic staff and said it would seize two US diplomatic properties after the US House of Representatives and the Senate approved new sanctions on Russia. Russia said the US had until September 1 to reduce its diplomatic staff in Russia to 455 people, matching the number of Russian diplomats left in the US after Washington expelled 35 Russians in December. New US sanctions were in part a response to conclusions by US intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 US presidential election , and to further punish Russia for its annexation of Crimea in 2014. OPINION: Wag the bear Worsening relations The Russian president reiterated that the US sanctions were a step to worsening relations between the two countries. "We were waiting for quite a long time that maybe something would change for the better, were holding out hope that the situation would change somehow. But it appears that even if it changes someday, it will not change soon," Putin said. However, he said Moscow and Washington were achieving results on cooperation even "in this quite difficult situation". The creation of the Southern de-escalation zone in Syria showed a concrete result of the joint work between the two countries, he said. Earlier in the day, a top Russian diplomat warned of retaliation by Moscow. Speaking on ABC's "This Week," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov referred to a bill passed by Congress on Thursday to sanction his country as "weird and unacceptable", and said it was "the last straw". "If the US side decides to move further towards ... deterioration, we will answer. We will respond in kind. We will ... retaliate," he said. The US-Russia relationship has become increasingly strained in the wake of US intelligence agencies conclusion that the Kremlin interfered in the US election to discredit Hillary Clinton and help President Donald Trump win the election. Russia has denied meddling in the US election. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the former director of the FBI , is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential race and whether or not Trump's campaign may have colluded with Russia - an allegation that Trump and his associates have staunchly denied.

Leaders of the world's top economies have arrived in Germany for the start of the G20 in Hamburg, where large groups of protesters are rallying against the summit. The meeting in the port city in the country's north comes at a time of major shifts in the global geopolitical landscape, with US President Donald Trump's "America First" policies pushing Europe and China closer together. More than 100,000 demonstrators are also expected to descend on the city to protest against everything from climate change policies to capitalism. Amid seemingly intractable conflicts, the host, German Chancellor Angela Merkel , faces the daunting task of steering leaders towards a consensus on trade, security, climate and migration - all issues that have become more contentious since Trump entered the White House in January. Merkel said she hopes to find "compromises and answers" on a range of issues at the two-day meeting. All eyes on Trump All eyes will be on the US president, who will make his maiden appearance at the summit. Al Jazeera's James Bays, reporting from Hamburg, said the highlight of the Friday will be the meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin , an encounter that will be intensely scrutinised following allegations by US intelligence agencies that Moscow meddled in the US election. Trump said in a tweet he was looking forward to the meeting. Bays said Trump and Putin have "important issues to discuss, particularly Ukraine , but also the issue of Syria where, it is believed, there may be a new initiative coming from Russia and the US to try to get the political track moving and to try to get some stabilisation zones around Syria". Trump's meeting with Putin will take place at the same time as a closed-door meeting on climate change, which could be "a bit of a sign" about Trump's policies on the climate, Bays said. READ MORE: It's time for G20 leaders to embrace civil society The summit is the first meeting of world leaders since Trump announced that the US would withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, deeply disappointing Merkel, France's Emmanuel Macron and other US allies who had hoped to maintain momentum in the battle against climate change. The summit will also bring together Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a time when Washington is ratcheting up pressure on Beijing to rein in North Korea after it test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile. Among the other issues expected to be discussed at this year's G20 are the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, and the state of the global economy. It is Trump's first appearance at the G20 summit since taking office in January [Saul Loeb/AFP] Mass protests continue Large widespread protests have already taken place across Hamburg and more are expected throughout Friday and Saturday. On Friday morning, police clashed with protesters who torched patrol cars and blocked roads. Late on Thursday, a peaceful marched turned violent when police used water cannon, pepper spray and batons to disperse marchers who they say attacked them with bottles and other objects. More than 75 officers and dozens of protesters were injured. Al Jazeera's David Chater said that these protesters want to be heard and make an impact. "There are so many issues involved politically in the G20 summit," he said. "They are against the globalist capitalist system, they are against Trump's attempts to pull out of the climate change accords. They're essentially protesting every single issue that's going to be raised in this G20 summit." Many other groups are calling for peaceful protests and are pushing the G20 leaders for action to fight climate change and address economic disparities in the world. Some are even calling for the dissolution of the G20 itself so that the United Nations becomes the platform for such discussions. Hamburg has boosted its police with reinforcements from around the country and has 20,000 officers on hand to patrol the city's streets, skies and waterways.

US President Donald Trump has thanked President Vladimir Putin for expelling more than 750 American diplomatic staff from Russia . The comments were immediately criticised by current and former US officials. "I'm very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll," said Trump on Thursday , breaking nearly two weeks of silence on Putin's July 30 order cutting US embassy and consulate staff by nearly two-thirds. "There's no real reason for them to go back … We're going to save a lot of money." The State Department had no immediate reaction to the comments Trump made to reporters while on vacation at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. READ MORE: Putin - 'Don't worry, be happy' as Trump ditches climate change agreement Congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating the conclusions of US intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election campaign by hacking and other methods to help Trump. They are also looking into possible collusion between the campaign and Russian officials. Moscow has repeatedly denied meddling in the election and Trump denies any campaign collusion. Putin, reacting to new sanctions imposed by the US Congress and reluctantly signed into law by Trump, ordered Washington to cut 755 of its 1,200 embassy and consulate staff by September. Many of those affected likely will be local Russian staffers. During his campaign and since becoming president, Trump has consistently called for better ties with Russia, declined to criticise Putin, and refused to unequivocally embrace the conclusions of the intelligence agencies. 'Grotesque' Trump's remarks on Thursday were immediately denounced by current and former US officials who have served both Republican and Democratic administrations. Nicholas Burns, the State Department's third-ranking official under former president George W Bush, called Trump's comments "grotesque". "If he was joking, he should know better," said Burns, now a professor at Harvard University's John F Kennedy School of Government. "If he wasn't, it's unprecedented. A president has never defended the expulsion of our diplomats." OPINION: Will Putin expend Snowden for Trump? The State Department was "horrified and rattled" by Trump’s remarks, said a veteran US diplomat who has served in Russia, speaking on condition of anonymity. And Heather Conley, formerly a top State Department official dealing with European affairs, said the expulsions of hundreds of people from an important US embassy is extraordinary. "It is very difficult to see how the president could view these expulsions as a 'positive' development in any form," Conley said.

Pressuring North Korea over its nuclear missile programme is "misguided and futile", Russian President Vladimir Putin says, arguing that only dialogue without preconditions can resolve the crisis. The Korean Peninsula was "balancing on the brink of a large-scale conflict", Putin wrote in an article to be published on Friday before a summit of BRICS economies to be held in China on Sunday. "Russia believes that the policy of putting pressure on Pyongyang to stop its nuclear missile programme is misguided and futile," he wrote in the article sent to media in Brazil , Russia, India, China and South Africa - the BRICS member states. "The region's problems should only be settled through a direct dialogue of all the parties concerned without any preconditions. Provocations, pressure and militarist and insulting rhetoric are a dead-end road." Explainer: Why didn't Japan shoot down Pyongyang's missiles? Putin said Russia and China, North Korea's most important ally, had drawn up a plan to ease tensions and create lasting peace without the use of threats or military force. In Seoul, a senior South Korean official also urged Pyongyang on Friday to return to the negotiating table, while warning against "continuing provocations". "Our government's stance that we need to peacefully resolve North Korean nuclear issues and Korean Peninsula issues remains unchanged," Lee Eugene, South Korean Unification Ministry deputy spokesperson, said. "We urge North Korea to stop making rhetorical criticisms and threats and to come out to the path of dialogue and cooperation." Lee said Seoul and Washington continue to monitor North Korea's activities , acknowledging Pyongyang is capable of conducting another nuclear test "at any time within a short period of preparations". Pyongyang continues to be defiant despite international pressure to stop its missile tests [AP] France's foreign minister said on Friday that North Korea would have the capability to send long-range ballistic missiles in a few months and urged China to be more active diplomatically to resolve the crisis. "The situation is extremely serious... We see North Korea setting itself as an objective to have tomorrow or the day after missiles that can transport nuclear weapons. In a few months that will be a reality," Jean-Yves Le Drian told RTL radio. "North Korea must find the path to negotiations. It must be diplomatically active." Trump rhetoric The comments came amid US President Donald Trump's ongoing war of words with North Korea, with the US leader warning Pyongyang of "fire and fury" and North Korea threatening to fire missiles at the US Pacific territory of Guam.

The test appeared to have been carried out by North Korea in response to ongoing war exercises between the United States and South Korea . Analysts say North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un wants a real nuclear deterrent against the United States to ensure the survival of his government, believing it will strengthen his negotiating position when Pyongyang returns to talks. This year alone, North Korea has launched at least 13 missiles and some analysts believe it could have viable long-range nuclear missiles before the end of Trump's first term in early 2021. In response to North Korea's latest move, Japanese fighter jets joined US bombers and stealth aircraft in military exercises on Thursday in skies south of the Korean Peninsula. Trump also said, "talking is not the answer" to the crisis, without giving more details about his next move. Last week, Japan and the US imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals that support Pyongyang, including those in China and Russia.

Navalny, 40, is a staunch Kremlin critic and anti-corruption campaigner [Getty Images] Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been freed from prison after serving a 20-day sentence for organising a rally without official permission from authorities. He was taken into custody late last month as he prepared to travel to Nizhny Novgorod, Russia 's fifth-biggest city, to lead a rally. {articleGUID} He was arrested for organising another rally in St Petersburg, President Vladimir Putin 's hometown, without authorisation, although the rally in Nizhny Novgorod had the proper permits. After he was released from jail on Sunday, the opposition leader posted on social media that he planned to participate in an evening anti-government protest in the city of Astrakhan. Navalny, 40, a staunch Kremlin critic and anti-corruption campaigner, has long been the most visible opposition figure to Putin's rule. He plans to run for the presidency against Putin in the March election. Navalny rose to prominence in Russian politics in 2008, when he started blogging about alleged corruption at some of Russia's large, state-controlled corporations. Navalny used social media to reach out to predominantly young followers, mocking the establishment loyal to Putin. He rallied tens of thousands of people during widespread anti-Putin protests across the country. He came second in the 2013 Moscow mayoral race after a grassroots campaign against the Kremlin-backed candidate. Navalny launched hundreds of lawsuits contesting the victory of his rival, Sergei Sobyanin. Navalny has been in jail multiple times in relation to anti-government protests.

Imtiaz Cajee, the nephew of Ahmed Timol, poses with his book, Timol: A Quest for Justice, at the High Court in Pretoria, South Africa [AP] Durban, South Africa - For almost 50 years, they claimed he had jumped to his death. On Thursday, 46 years later, the Pretoria High Court put the matter to rest. Judge Billy Mothle ruled that Ahmed Timol, an anti-apartheid activist, had not jumped out the window of the 10th floor of a police station in Johannesburg. Timol, 29 at the time, had been pushed out. "Timol did not jump out of the window of room 1026 but was either pushed out of the window or from the roof of the John Vorster Police Station," Mothle said. "Thus he did not commit suicide but was murdered. "The sub-standard and sloppy manner in which the investigation of Timol's death was conducted, supposed the view that there was clear intent to cover up the incident through a fabricated version of suicide." Following the judgement, Mothle ordered that Sergeant Jan Rodrigues, considered the last person to have seen Timol alive and who admitted to being part of a cover-up, be investigated for murder. Who was Ahmed Timol? Timol was an anti-apartheid activist from Johannesburg. He was a school teacher and a member of the South African Communist Party. After threats to his safety, Timol fled to London in 1967, and he later underwent armed training in Moscow before returning to South Africa as part of the ANC's armed wing. He was subsequently picked up by the security branch in October 1971 and interrogated, tortured and murdered at the notorious John Vorster Police Station in central Johannesburg. Between 1970 and 1990, eight people who were detained at the police station died. It has been described by former detainees as the "pinnacle of torture chambers". An inquest in 1972 concluded that Timol had committed suicide, a stance the apartheid government has consistently held. Timol's family never accepted that version and have consistently accused the apartheid government of murder. According to a report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, 75 deaths were recorded in detention during apartheid, but not a single police officer was held responsible or officially tried. In 2015, Timol's nephew, Imtiaaz Cajee, approached the National Prosecutions Authority to reopen the case. The verdict is an important one. First and foremost, it provides closure to Timol's family. The verdict sheds light on the extent of apartheid's cruelty, exposing its brutality as not just limited to physical violence, but home to a vast machinery of concealment and desecration of character that is complex and multifold. Timol's murder is but one of many stories of injustice hidden by apartheid, and left mostly untouched since 1994, lest it shake up the fragile democratic experiment. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission brought solace, but not justice. For instance, when Hawa Timol testified in 1996 about the death of her son, none of the perpetrators came forward. She died a year later. This has come to define much of the selective amnesia regarding South Africa's past. In many ways, the failures of the current ANC-led government are being used to reversion the tremendous impact of colonialism and white-minority racist rule in South Africa. If anything, the judgement brings perspective: It may be time to explore some of the more obscure, lesser-known details of apartheid's crimes. It may be very necessary if we are to understand where South Africa is headed.

Chahari, South Sudan - The dull thud of a coconut being thrown against a flat stone summons the children around the low straw-thatched mud tukul, a traditional round house in eastern Africa . Nadia* pulls the orange pulp out of the fruit where the rind has cracked, breaking it up among many tiny hands. "One person was shot dead in front of me, so I had to jump over his body," she says, describing her escape from the town of Ikotos, in the Imatong state of South Sudan . Tens of thousands of people have been killed and more than 3.5 million have been displaced since South Sudan descended into war shortly after it seceded from Sudan in 2011. Starting in December 2013, President Salva Kiir 's troops have clashed with those of rebel leader and former Vice President Riek Machar. A peace accord signed in August 2015 fell apart after less than three months. Women and children have paid a particularly heavy price in the fighting with over two million children displaced and reports of ethnic cleansing and rape perpetrated by all sides in the conflict. And while the men fight, many women are left behind to carry the day-to-day burden of caring for their families. This was not the first time Nadia had seen someone shot dead, but this time was different because she was on her own with her children . Nadia is a single mother. Her youngest is six years old and both he and his two older brothers depend solely on her. Of their father, she says "he is not here," without further explanation. In July 2016, when the rebel forces and the government army clashed in Ikotos, Nadia was working as a cleaner at a government office. "When a group of youths attacked the barracks, we shut ourselves into our house," she says. But an hour later, with the fighting becoming more intense, she left everything behind as she fled with her children. They travelled for three days, hiding in the bush and surviving on grass and wild fruit, as they made their way to the village of Chahari in Eastern Equatoria state where her relatives lived. The state was once considered a safe and fertile area of South Sudan. But, after the peace agreement failed, the fighting reached some cities in Eastern Equatoria as well. Two million people are internally displaced in South Sudan. Nadia is hoping to find a relatively peaceful life in this remote, rural area, far from the fighting engulfing the cities and larger towns. Still, providing her children with enough food to eat is a struggle. A famine fuelled by drought and fighting has ravaged the region for four years. Women digging in the fields, fetching water or picking wild fruit from trees are a familiar sight in these villages, while the men are away grazing livestock or fighting on the front line. Most men here take more than one wife. Maria Gaudenzi, area team leader for the AVSI Foundation, explains that often the men "are unable to take care of these nuclei, so all the responsibilities fall completely on their wives". The Italian non-governmental organisation (NGO) is the only active international NGO in this area. It has been running schooling, healthcare and food security programmes in partnership with the World Food Programme and UNICEF since 2005. With husbands absent, women live by their wits, farming, caregiving, and working on side businesses to generate more income. Away from the frontline of the conflict, they are the ones upholding the country. WATCH: Women of South Sudan - Broken bodies, shattered dreams (25:23) The majority of women in rural and urban areas are expected to take sole responsibility for child-rearing [Javier Sauras/Al Jazeera] Women's health and wellness Betty Justine Olia, a 38-year-old local health worker with AVSI, has just filled a syringe with the measles vaccine. A dozen women have gathered from surrounding communities to be immunised against polio, diphtheria, pertussis, hepatitis and tetanus, with their children clinging to their necks. "The role of a man here is only to look after cattle and go for cattle raiding," Olia says. "Most of agriculture and caregiving activities are on women." Livestock is very important for local ethnic groups, as it works as a sort of currency. Rosina Imolong, Olia's 25-year-old colleague, explains the importance of updating health cards to the rest of the mothers. According to its 2016/2017 Approved National Budget plan, South Sudan has invested only three percent of its overall expenditure on health, while security-related expenses account for 44 percent. "The health system is weak, meaning that the government is not able to provide even the most basic services," Gaudenzi says, "so there is this huge demand of support from NGOs." In half an hour the women will pack the equipment, drugs and mats onto their bicycles and head for the next village. "We are carrying out this service to the people who are not reachable by normal facilities," Olia says. Pushing hard on the pedals, the women travel to four different villages each week, visiting pregnant women and looking for malnourished children. Their team represents the only healthcare that most locals will see in their lifetime. Imolong and Olia have similar stories to the women they help through the programme. Olia struggles to make ends meet, as she cares for her six children by herself. "My partner left me because I spent too much time taking care of my disabled father," she explains. At night, after attending visits and workshops, she sells home-brewed alcohol to make some extra money. Imolong thought she had managed to avoid a similar situation when, in 2010, she married a school teacher. But her experience has not met her expectations. "He doesn't help me at all as he keeps the money he is earning from me and asks for mine," Imolong says. She was two weeks pregnant when they had their first quarrel. "He said that my head was not good and it was better for him to marry an illiterate woman," Imolong recalls. Since independence, the government has advanced several steps in gender rights: the Transitional Constitution and Bill of Rights guarantee equality among men and women, setting out a 25 percent quota for women in legislative and executive bodies. Nevertheless, with the ongoing war, little has changed on the ground in the everyday lives of women, in healthcare, safety, employment and education.

In an area where subsistence agriculture is the main activity, international NGOs are seen as the most reliable and generous employers. The education they received growing up in refugee camps in Uganda where they both attended formal schools, has played a significant role during the job-hiring process. Yet education remains a challenge for young people in South Sudan, and many girls face additional difficulties due to the gender roles assigned to them. According to UNICEF, 76 percent of South Sudanese girls are out of school. "From an early age, families send their male children to school while keeping their daughters at home to help with domestic work and look after their younger siblings," says Gaudenzi. Even if they step into the classroom, child marriages and early pregnancy often cut their education short. "So girls may start their education, but they give up later," says Gaudenzi. According to 2016 National Education Statistics , in every grade female students are more likely to drop out than male students. According to UNICEF report , The state of the world's children 2016, 52 percent of girls in South Sudan are married by their 18th birthday, and nine percent by their 15th. "Many girls at the end of the primary school get married, so not many of them go up to secondary [school]," says Sister Paskwina, a 62-year-old nun who teaches at the local school in the town of Isohe. Child marriages in the region have increased as a result of the ongoing crisis, according to a survey conducted by CARE International, with families resorting to them in the hope of receiving a dowry payment or having one less mouth to feed. "I went to school until I was three months pregnant, but when the school discovered it, I was told to stay home," says 18-year-old Paska, her six-month-old son Bryan sticking his head out of her arms. She was halfway through her first year of secondary school when she became pregnant. Local teachers discourage pregnant teenagers from attending classes, even after they give birth because this "could be seen as promoting this behaviour," explains Paskwina. "My boyfriend had no cows to pay to my family, so he ran to the capital," Paska says. She nervously taps her left foot on the floor when talking about her child's father. According to customary traditions, a man must pay a cattle price to the father of his bride as a dowry. But Paska's partner was a student so left to find a job in Juba, the capital. She believes that he will come back for her when he has earned enough money. Paska understood that without schooling she would have no chance of finding a decent job. She was determined to finish school. During her pregnancy, she asked her classmates for notes, so she could study at home. Her family supported her, so they contacted AVSI foundation, which helped persuade the school to allow Paska back into the classroom. She wakes up at six every morning, breastfeeds Bryan and attends classes. During the midday break, while other students play in the schoolyard, she rushes home to feed him again. A dream drives her. "I love science, and I want to be the first female doctor here," she says. If she fulfils her hopes, she might become the first South Sudanese working in a hospital in this region, as most doctors currently come from Uganda. Paska's dream is to be part of a new generation of South Sudanese women, capable of moving their country forward, not just living idly by as the men herd cattle and fight wars. *Name changed to protect identity SOURCE: Al Jazeera ABOUT THE AUTHORS Michele Bertelli Javier Sauras Women's Rights South Sudan Poverty & Development War & Conflict Africa

"It was an ambush," he told Al Jazeera, explaining that they were caught off guard due to the calmness of the area. One of his fellow militiamen is now hospitalised and in critical condition, after a rocket tore through the patrol car he was in. "We spent days working there," Lawan recalled. "The attack happened on our last day." READ MORE: More than half of Borno schools closed over Boko Haram When the dust settled, more than 50 people had been killed. It was the deadliest Boko Haram attack so far in 2017 and came at a time of increased suicide bombings and abductions in the region. In response, the Nigerian army deployed additional personnel and equipment, where locals say a climate of fear now prevails. The Nigerian military declined requests for comment on the ongoing offensive against Boko Haram. In early September, Amnesty International published a report that said Boko Haram was responsible for at least 400 deaths since April. 'No end in sight' Boko Haram was established in 2009, and the group boasts of several thousand fighters. Throughout the last year, fighting between the armed organisation and the Nigerian military has left at least 20,000 people dead and more than 2.6 million displaced in northeastern Nigeria . Last month, the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) said that fighting between the government and Boko Haram resulted in the closure of more than half of all the schools in the country's northeastern state of Borno. The report found that an estimated three million children are in emergency need of education . It added that nearly 100 children have also been used as "human bombs" since the beginning of the year. READ MORE: Boko Haram - Behind the Rise of Nigeria's Armed Group That bloodshed has also devastated farmers and resulted in chronic food shortages that have left hundreds of thousands of people in the region dependent on aid agencies for help and teetering on the brink of starvation. Sadeeq Garba Shehu, a retired army captain and security expert, explained that Boko Haram's recent loss of territory to the Nigerian army has led to the group striking back with more suicide bombings and kidnappings. "Holding ground also makes you weaker because … it means the opposing force has something to hit," he told Al Jazeera. "But when you attack and run, you kind of dilute all the advantages in numbers, in equipment, in training." The Nigerian military, which has increased its campaigns in the last two years, has claimed that Boko Haram is weakened and near defeat. Yet, Shehu fears there is no end in sight. "The notion of complete victory may be very difficult to obtain, but maybe we could have sufficient victory," he said. Al Jazeera's Ahmed Idris reports from northeast Nigeria.

Harriet Nantongo, mother of one, was one of 23 women who was murdered [Megan Iacobini de Fazio/Al Jazeera] Kampala, Uganda - Noah Musiba sat by the door all night listening out for a noise that would signal the return of his wife. His nine-year-old daughter, Sheerat, lay on a mattress on the floor by his feet, wide awake. It was the early hours of Thursday, September 14, and Harriet Nantongo, Noah's wife of 10 years and Sheerat's mother, had not returned from work. "I hoped that maybe she had slept at her sister's place, but when we went to look, she wasn't there," said Noah, "so we started searching all the hospitals". By the afternoon, Musiba reported his wife missing, fearing the worst. For the past year, she had been working at a local rubbish dump, sifting through the garbage in search of polythene bags to wash in a nearby stream. On a good day, she could sell two 15kg bunches of bags and return home with $3 in her pocket on the three-hour walk back to her family. But on Wednesday night, she hadn't come back. In the preceding months, several bodies of women had been found dumped in that area, all of them naked, strangled, and with sticks in their vaginas. The first victim was found in Nansana district, not far from Kampala, on May 27. By May 30, three more women had been found, all killed and dumped in a similar way. Of those four bodies, only one was identified - Nampijja Juliet, a mother of two who lived in the area. Several more - Regina Bakitte, mayor of Nansana, put that number at at least 10 women - some of whom remain unidentified, were found in banana gardens and cassava fields in the following weeks. In early June, the murders had spread to Katabi Town, in Entebbe district, where Harriet lived with her family. To date, there have been a total of 23 murders, according to the Ugandan police, although many believe the number may be higher. The last body, that of 22-year-old waitress Sarah Neliima, was found on September 20. Harriet Nantongo was last seen alive leaving for work at a local rubbish dump [Megan Iacobini de Fazio/Al Jazeera] Ugandans weigh political motive The first few murders went almost unnoticed "perhaps because the victims are all low-income women, and women are never a priority in this country", said Sandra Nassali, a representative of the local organisation ACFODE. When the police did start investigating, the reasons they gave for the murders were varied and contradictory. At first, Kale Kayihura, an inspector general, blamed domestic violence. Later, he blamed unemployment , drug abuse and criminal gangs. On September 7, Jeje Odongo, internal affairs minister, claimed in parliament that the murders were linked to a group of "devil worshipping" Illuminati. Asan Kasingye, a police spokesperson, told Al Jazeera: "Some of the murders were related to land, and then they gravitated to domestic violence. "Over half of these women were prostitutes, while the others were engaged in several personal relationships, and they were taken advantage of." But Ugandans are not satisfied with any of these explanations, and many point to possible political motives. "I don't believe that it has anything to do with witchcraft," said Bakitte, the mayor of Nansana. "I think it's political." Bakitte, a member of the Democratic Party, thinks that the government might be organising the killings in an attempt to discredit the opposition. "This is an opposition stronghold, and so is Katabi. It's not a coincidence. They want people to live in fear." Al Jazeera made several attempts to contact government representatives for a response, to no avail. Bakitte also suggested that the bodies were dumped in strategic areas - patches of land and gardens belonging to smallholder farmers, in an area where the value of land is steadily increasing. "They could use it as an excuse to say that if people don't develop their land, then the government has the right to grab it from them for security reasons," says Bakitte, pointing to recent controversy surrounding a proposed amendment to the constitution which would allow the government to take over private land before compensation. The locations where the women's bodies were have led to suggestions that the murders may have political motives [Megan Iacobini de Fazio/Al Jazeera] The theories are wide-ranging. The mayor of Katabi Town, Ronald Kalema, believed the murders could be a "ruthless act by somebody who wants to hurt the government", an attempt to make Uganda look insecure. "Plus, you can't underestimate the importance of Entebbe, where the president lives. If you cannot protect Entebbe, you are showing you cannot protect the country," he said. Another theory points to a widely reported clash between leaders of different security agencies - Kahiyura, the police inspector general (IGP), and Henry Tumukunde, the security minister. "One of the rumours is that someone is doing this to discredit the IGP and make him look bad", says Bakitte, the Democratic Party member. Another rumour? "The police are doing this to get more resources and funds," she said. In Katabi, people back the idea that the police are involved. "Everyone knows that it is the [police] doing this," says a local driver, who requested anonymity. Kasingye, the police spokesman, told Al Jazeera that he was "99 percent certain that there is no organisation with a political or economic agenda" behind the killings, and that the rumours have taken hold because "people in this area support the opposition, and this rumour works for them". Tumukunde refused Al Jazeera's request for comment. Long-held rivalries Jude Kagoro, a researcher based in Germany , has spent more than a decade studying Ugandan security services and police. Although he did not believe police are involved, he said the spiralling of rumours is unsurprising. "These rivalries are not new. Different security agencies must vie for the attention of the president, for resources, for recognition. If you don't compete you're out of the game," he said. Mercy Muduru spent weeks conducting her own investigation and poring over case files. She is a senior programme manager at The Uganda Association of Women Lawyers (FIDA), and is one of the activists convinced that this is not the work of a serial killer, nor is it anything to do with witchcraft. "This is something deeper, something political," she said. Muduru believes that the timing of these murders - as the political situation in the country deteriorates with greater repression - is not a coincidence. "What better time than this one to send a message?" she says. Like other activists, Muduru is outraged by what she sees as a lack of action by the authorities to protect women, and by the way in which cases are being discussed. "The trend is always to taint the character of women, and this is why the police are claiming that the victims are prostitutes, even though our research shows that the majority are not ... it shouldn't matter anyway, no one deserves to be killed like that," she says. President Museveni visited Entebbe on September 25, months after the murders had started, to reassure locals that the cases were being investigated and that authorities would "apprehend those behind the killings". But the various theories swirling around, says researcher Kagoro, are representative of the low opinion Ugandans have of their government and security forces. "Psyche and reality might be two different things, but the reasons people think the way they think also tell us a lot," he says. 'It was her' An unknown number of people - "more than 30" including a 16-year-old girl, according to Kasingye - have been arrested over the cases and remain in police custody. At least two businessmen, who have been named in the local press, have been charged with "terrorism", murder and aggravated robbery. One of the accused, Ivan Katongole, was due to appear in court recently, but his case was postponed after state prosecutors went on strike. Katongole works in the local fish business, and was accused of carrying out the murders to increase his wealth through witchcraft - an accusation he denies. Muduru, the activist, points to much of the evidence being circumstantial in these cases and fears that some of those currently in custody may be innocent. "I am disappointed in the way this is being managed, and I place all weight on the state to seek justice," she says. Back in Katabi, Noah recalls telling his wife to be careful as she crossed the busy highway, the last time he saw her alive. Six days after he reported her missing, a search party of friends and relatives and neighbours found her body in a bush close to her workplace. "I heard people screaming and Harriet's sister held me back. I collapsed when they said it was her," he says. They had given up on the police helping with the search. Since that day, Noah has not been contacted by police, nor has he received any kind of support. As Noah looks for ways to pay for his daughter's education without Harriet's meagre income, the young motherless girl stays with an aunt. Since his wife's murder, Noah Musiba has had to support their young daughter alone [Megan Iacobini de Fazio/Al Jazeera] SOURCE: Al Jazeera ABOUT THE AUTHOR Megan Iacobini de Fazio Uganda Africa
President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the continent's first female president, is stepping down after serving two six-year terms in office - the constitutionally mandated limit [Reuters] As President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf leaves office, it is tempting to speak of her as an "international feminist icon". Her power play is an ode to matrilineal politics which dominated the continent before the advent of colonialism. Alongside the Queen Mother in the Kingdom of Baganda and the members of women's assemblies in the Yoruba tribe, Sirleaf stands in a long line of strong African women who led their communities and nations. Rising to power following Liberia's devastating civil war in 2005 and winning a second term in 2011, Sirleaf has symbolically set a precedent for women in the country in a way few have done before her. Yet in the world of politics, both on local and international stages, symbolism does not always translate into practice and policies. The example of the number of female candidates in the October 10 Liberian elections is a case in point. Although Sirleaf appointed several women to high positions in finance and commerce in her first term, we do have to question how far-reaching Sirleaf's efforts were, when only one woman - Macdella Cooper - out of 20 candidates ran for the top job. While Sirleaf came out in full support of Cooper and all other women candidates who ran for parliamentary seats, her party ranked below peripheral parties in putting forward female candidates. Of course, there shouldn't be the expectation that Sirleaf's two terms would have solved all women's problems in Liberia . In August, Robtel Neajai Pailey and Korto Reeves Williams asked a very relevant question about Sirleaf's time in power in their Al Jazeera op-ed about her legacy: Did she make a concerted effort to change the status quo o r were her politics just another example of "femocracy", a term which Nigerian Academic Amina Mama has defined as "an anti-democratic female power structure which claims to exist for the advancement of ordinary women … advancing the interests of small female elite … upholding the patriarchal status quo". While Sirleaf came out in full support of Cooper and all other women candidates who ran for parliamentary seats, as Pailey and Williams pointed out, her party ranked below peripheral parties in putting forward female candidates. And this is in spite of legal amendments in 2014, which were supposed to propose greater representation of women in roles across the political spectrum - a law that Sirleaf herself did not ratify. {articleGUID} Her successor will almost certainly be a man, and parliament will be heavily men-dominated. Women are making up only 16 percent of approved candidates for parliamentary seats compared with 14 percent in Liberia's 2011 elections. Statistically, it is hardly a jump across the river. If these numbers are anything to go by, the next president will have to work tirelessly to ensure Liberia can have a second woman president in the future. And lack of representation in politics is only one of the many problems women face in Liberia. Early pregnancies and instances of gender-based violence are still common in Liberia. So while women's empowerment in the political sphere was and still is important, there were even more important issues that needed to be addressed during Sirleaf's time in office to guarantee long-term gender equality in Liberia. Sirleaf's administration did acknowledge these challenges and worked towards overcoming them, but once again these issues proved to be too complex and profound for a single administration to tackle fully . Education is perhaps one area of policy in which Sirleaf made some significant progress towards ensuring equality for girls and women. Sirleaf, who has a degree from Harvard University, supported several schemes to ensure Liberian girls get an education, even when the country was battling a devastating Ebola epidemic. But Liberia still ranked 114 out of 144 countries in World Economic Forum's 2016 gender equality report ( pdf ), so there is a long way to go. In her final presidential address earlier this year, Sirleaf made the case to the legislative assembly that education is a long-term aspiration and that traditional methods need to be reformulated. This will undoubtedly be an important foundation set by Sirleaf for the incoming president to build upon in the post-Sirleaf era. During her time in office, Sirleaf also tried to eradicate a tragic practice that affects the lives of countless Liberian women: female genital mutilation (FGM). While she was vocal about the need to ban the practice, her efforts were not successful. {articleGUID} Admittedly, the fight against FGM was not an easy one to win. But for all the fights she has encountered, including her fight to end the civil war which led to her winning the Nobel Peace prize in 2010 or her fight against Ebola, for her mandate to be outlived by this particular crisis is a sad travesty for her and all those young girls who are impacted. In Liberia, secret women's societies known as Sande carry out FGM, as part of a coming of age ritual. The tradition is deeply rooted, with half of Liberian women subjected to it. To this day, four in 10 Liberian women support the practice, and it is carried out by almost all tribes, and by both Muslim and Christian communities, according to UNICEF. Sirleaf pledged to ban FGM as part of a domestic violence bill, but opposition from a number of politicians led to the provision being removed, which saw the bill passed last year without making any significant impact. It was and still is a big blow, given that Nigeria and Gambia, under male leadership, have secured a ban on FGM while Africa's first woman president of state was unable to do so. Liberia's bolstering of civil society and groups like Women Solidarity who are still fighting to ban the practice and may very well soften the fall for Sirleaf, should they be successful in the near future. In her two terms, Sirleaf was facing expectations that were impossible to live up to. There was a perception that with a woman in the highest office in the country, gender equality was easy to achieve.In the end, many believe Sirleaf failed women during her time in office - she did not increase women's representation in politics, she did not manage to bring gender equality in education, and she could not ban FGM. Some of these failures were her own making, and some were not. But these failures should not take anything away from the remarkable role she played in saving her country from war. She worked towards creating a better Liberia for women and the situation of the country in the aftermath of these elections will be an important testimony as to whether she actually managed to bring greater change or not. After all, the fight for women's rights is a long drawn battle the world over and only time will tell whether Liberia is ready to fully honour its womenfolk.

Police officers detain an opposition supporter during a protest in the slum area of Mathare in the capital Nairobi, Kenya, October 26, 2017. [Reuters/Siegfried Modola] When they urged the Independent Elections and Boundaries Commission to go ahead with the scheduled October 26 presidential election rerun in Kenya , the ruling Jubilee coalition probably expected that they would at least get the same number of voters to come out and vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta as did in the original August election. However, according to an interim report from the Commission, around half of the people who voted in August did not vote again in October. According to the Commission, voter turnout in August was 79.1 percent or just over 15 million voters. Meanwhile, although numbers from are still being tallied, even the most generous estimate from the IEBC currently stands at 48 percent turnout - a number that is falling as results trickle in. What was supposed to be a landslide birthday victory for Uhuru Kenyatta has instead turned out to be a huge embarrassment for his Jubilee party. The main opposition coalition, NASA, is celebrating the poor turnout as a triumph of their election boycott. In a press conference on October 27, Party Chair Musalia Mudavadi pointed out that low turnout in at least 18 counties across the country can be directly attributed to the boycott. According to forms uploaded on the Commission's portal, in places as disparate as Mandera, Turkana, Kitui, Kilifi and Homa Bay, some polling stations with the maximum 673 registered voters had only a single ballot cast. The dip was significant, and it was national. The ruling party has not officially responded to the situation although on local television and radio their supporters have struggled to legitimise the process. They argue that people were intimidated and afraid to come out to vote. Yet, the only places where there was apparent intimidation or tension were counties that Odinga would arguably have won. In most of the country, everyone who wanted to participate in the event did, and everyone who wanted to stay home also did. With those notable exceptions in Nyanza and part of Nairobi, all things considered, this boycott went as well as one would hope in a democratic society. The Jubilee administration's embarrassment is palpable, and there has been some indication in the local press that after months of intransigence, they are finally willing to negotiate with the opposition. In fact, this low turn out was a referendum on the credibility of the October 26 election, in which the entire country said "no thanks". That even the president's own supporters wouldn't participate underscores that Kenyans across the political divide did not think that the event was worth their time. Certainly, the boycott was a big factor. The fact that Raila Odinga said he would not participate made the whole thing less competitive for supporters of both parties. For many voters, this election was a contest between Kenyatta and Odinga, and when Odinga withdrew, it was no longer a contest. Whereas NASA supporters likely stayed home because the party asked them to, Jubilee supporters probably stayed home because they didn't think it was worth their time to stand in line for an election their candidate was guaranteed to win. Either way, that says that voters didn't believe that the event that took place on Thursday was worth it. Apathy also probably played a part. While outsiders have only just started paying attention to this story, Kenyans have been living with this election for nearly three years. There have been protests, reforms speeches, announcements and intrigues at the IEBC since 2015. It was inevitable after the August iteration was cancelled that there would be a dip in participation in any new election because many Kenyans are simply ready for the whole process to be over. Fear may also have been a factor. In the days before the election, several dramatic events poisoned the already toxic political environment. A petition was filed to have the Supreme Court postpone the election, but only two of the court's seven justices showed up. One justice had a particularly dire reason - her bodyguard was shot and injured. {articleGUID} Another gave a more flimsy justification, claiming that she couldn't find a flight back to Nairobi. Uncertain of how the various political actors would respond to this situation, public anxiety heightened and likely left people unable to rationalise taking on the extra risk for a process that was ultimately designed as a selection of a single candidate rather than an election. Other region-specific factors are also important. In four counties in the former Nyanza province - the main NASA base - elections were postponed until Saturday because of security concerns. Ballot boxes delivered to the distribution site were not distributed, and police shot and killed at least three protesters in Kisumu county. In his October 27 speech, Mudavadi accused the police of ethnic profiling and targeted violence against ethnic groups believed to support Odinga, including shootings, door-to-door searches and public humiliation of those caught in the crossfire. Still, voters in the Nyanza region only account for 2.67 million registered voters, and even if not a single ballot were cast here, it would be impossible to argue that this was the only reason why turnout dipped so significantly. The most interesting outcome to me was the situation in the northern counties of Kenya - the five semi-arid counties that together comprise 57 percent of Kenya's landmass. In the August election, the Jubilee administration won most of the available seats in these counties. However, in October, turnout in these counties has been dismal. Many polling stations had no voters at all. In all likelihood, because of the tenuous and fraught relationship these counties have with Nairobi, many voters are far more interested in local elections than they are in the presidential race. In addition to those participating in the boycott, given that there were no familiar faces participating in the October rerun, there was no incentive for many voters to show up. Overall, NASA's boycott was likely a necessary but not sufficient reason for the low turnout on October 26. Other factors worked in their favour too, including voter fatigue. Regardless, the Jubilee administration's embarrassment is palpable, and there has been some indication in the local press that after months of intransigence, they are finally willing to negotiate with the opposition. Ideally, these negotiations should focus on reforms of the electoral commission and improvement of a process for the benefit of all Kenyans - not in a political settlement that results in some form of power-sharing between the two major candidates. For the Kenyan voter, despite their political affiliation, October 26 was a resounding declaration that after 25 years of multiparty democracy they do not want to waste their time on a process of limited credibility. If there is a victory in all this, it belongs to the Kenyan people who should be honoured by finally giving them an election that is worthy.

Commercial farmers have a responsibility to identify the impact of their operations to avoid causing, contributing to, or being complicit in human rights abuses, writes Nnoko-Mewanu [Reuters] "We slept out in the open air like wild animals. Our children fell sick because of the cold," Felicia K told me. "We had not put up any proper structures. We were using leaves." Felicia, a 52-year-old mother of 10, is one of many rural Zambians who have lost land, homes and livelihoods when commercial farms displaced them. The Zambian government is promoting large-scale agricultural investment to diversify the economy and combat rural poverty. It is encouraging large commercial farms to lease large swaths of land and produce soybeans, wheat, corn and other crops for export. But some agricultural development programmes that the government claims will be a "panacea" for rural poverty are resulting in forced evictions and devastation for the rural poor. Over the past year, we have investigated the human rights impact of commercial farming in Serenje district, in Zambia's fertile central province. We interviewed Felicia and more than 130 other rural residents affected by commercial farming, as well as government officials, commercial farmers, and others. What happened to these people illustrates the risk of expanding commercial agriculture without proper government oversight. Many residents told us the commercial farms had displaced them - in some cases, forcibly evicting them. They said they had little or no opportunity to negotiate for compensation or resettlement. Some families had to move to areas with poor quality soil and could no longer grow sufficient food. The commercial farms pushed them further away from water sources, burdening women and girls in particular with spending far more time fetching water from distant streams. Many children dropped out of school because their previous schools were too far away and the new area did not have a school. {articleGUID} "I used to live in Mulembo ... we had a river flowing and lots of water," Felicia said. "Where we have settled now, there is no water." Felicia sat in front of her basic kitchen in a forest area where her family has camped for four years. As we watched her grandchildren play with a makeshift football, she told me how employees of a commercial farm kicked her and her family out. She said that in June 2013, farm contractors came with two bulldozers, demolished her house, uprooted her crops, and carried her and other residents off the farm with what belongings they could save on a tractor. They were dropped by the roadside. Felicia and her family lived in the open in a forest where they are not allowed to farm, with no shelter, for months before a government agency gave them tents. The commercial farm owner said the government had leased him the land, which he and the government claimed had been converted from "customary" to "state" land in the 1990s. The residents said they did not understand what this meant. Felicia said her family had lived on that land for decades. No one mentioned any conversion of the land from "customary" to "state" land that could be rented out. No one offered compensation or resettlement. If agricultural development is to be a "panacea" for rural poverty, Zambia's government and commercial farmers have to stop putting people like Felicia and her children in peril. Some commercial farms have not complied with the law. They have cleared land, displaced residents and started cultivation without conducting an environmental and social impact assessment or obtaining official authorisation. Some commercial farms evicted residents with little or no compensation. Government oversight of these farms in Serenje district has been minimal. Zambia's environment monitoring agency lacks the resources and capability to monitor operations of these ventures. Local authorities are barely involved in mediating displacement or resettlement. Government officials we interviewed pointed fingers at each other as to who is responsible for protecting local communities. To its credit, Zambia adopted a National Resettlement Policy in 2015, and also has compensation guidelines for internally displaced people. But Zambians are barely aware of those policies, nor do local officials enforce them. {articleGUID} The government could fix this. It has begun a process to develop a new national land policy, though it appears stalled. In addition, a customary land administration bill that would protect customary land rights is pending in Zambia's National Assembly, with no sign that it is moving forward anytime soon. These could clarify the rights to land and strengthen how land is managed. Meanwhile, the government should enforce existing laws and protect rural residents. Commercial farmers also have a responsibility to identify the impact of their operations to avoid causing, contributing to, or being complicit in human rights abuses, and to ensure that any abuses are remedied. "All we have now is hunger," Felicia told me. "Hunger and no water". If agricultural development is to be a "panacea" for rural poverty, Zambia's government and commercial farmers have to stop putting people like Felicia and her children in peril.

Odinga said that the result of the poll rerun was not credible [Simon Maina/AFP/Getty Images] Kenya's opposition leader has said his coalition will not accept the result of last week's controversial presidential election rerun, vowing to embark on a political campaign to "restore democracy in the country". Raila Odinga made the comments on Tuesday, one day after President Uhuru Kenyatta was declared the winner of the October 26 poll. Kenyatta took 98.2 percent of the votes, according to official results, but turnout stood at less than 40 percent following a boycott call by Odinga. "This election must not stand," Odinga told reporters, s aying that the result was not c redible and alleging that the electoral body was not in charge of the poll. "If allowed to stand, it will make a complete mockery of elections and might well be the end of the ballot as a means of instituting government in Kenya," added Odinga, leader of the National Super Alliance (NASA) opposition coalition. "It will completely destroy public confidence in the vote. Reasonable people will not turn out to vote in elections with pre-determined outcomes."

(25:01) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The poll rerun was called after the country's Supreme Court annulled an August 8 presidential election - following a challenge by Odinga - because of "illegalities and irregularities" in the voting process. Odinga withdrew from the repeat poll claiming reforms demanded by the opposition had not been made to the electoral commission. Ahead of the vote, he had urged his supporters to not participate in what he called a "sham" election and vowed to transform NASA into a "resistance movement" against the government. In his remarks on Tuesday, Odinga he referred to a programme of "vigorous positive political action" that will include "economic boycotts, peaceful processions. picketing and other legitimate protests". He added: "If there is no justice for the people, let there be no peace for the government." 'A tirade of conjuncture statistics' Kenya's Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) announced on Monday that 38.84 percent of the registered voters had turned up to cast their ballot in the poll rerun - that is 7.6 million of the 19.6 million registered voters.

So really art is what is happening at a particular time of a people's development or underdevelopment," Fela Kuti once said. "So I think, as far as Africa is concerned, music cannot be for enjoyment, music has to be for revolution." The iconic Afrobeat musician considered himself a change agent, and believed that African artists cannot afford to disengage from social issues. As Nigeria hosts the second edition of Art X Lagos, West Africa's leading contemporary art fair, at least a few of the artists participating appear to have followed in Fela Kuti's footsteps. The three-day affair begins on Friday, featuring more than 60 artists from 15 African countries across 14 galleries at the Civic Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos. The title of Rahima Gambo's multimedia work, "Education is Forbidden" , is co-opted from the English translation of Boko Haram and offers another perspective of the armed group's battles in northeastern Nigeria. She focuses on secondary school and university students, memories of attacks on their facilities, and Nigeria's educational system. The irony of Boko Haram attacking schools does not erase the fact that this crumbling system has been there for a while Rahima Gambo, artist " It goes beyond the sensational, beyond the deaths and the abduction ," says Gambo. "It's a quiet story of what is happening internally, what's happening in the mind of somebody who's living in what is now termed a conflict zone [and] going through an [educational] system that has almost, in a way, lost its purpose." A 31-year-old journalist who hails from the northeast, Gambo is more than qualified to explore the realities of the region with nuance. "The irony of Boko Haram attacking schools does not erase the fact that this crumbling system has been there for a while," she says. Combining text, photos, videos and textbook illustrations, she weaves a cohesive story of defiant school administrators and students still attending school despite threats, absent teachers, suicide bombings, and dilapidated infrastructure damaged by Boko Haram fighters. In one account, photos show students enjoying an annual campus variety show months after an ambush. In another piece, a woman recalls escaping a deadly attack on campus, but says all she worried about at the time were her transcript and school certificate she had left behind. "The in-betweens of [Gambo's] language … bring focus to the conditions of the particular moment," says Art X Lagos curator Missla Libsekal of the artist's part documentary, part art project. It is one of nine curated works interrogating how artists view themselves and respond to contemporary issues. "Documentary included [in] artistic practice is recognised historically as being useful to respond to [a] crisis," says Libsekal. The consequences of colonialism on education in the country's north is also documented in the narrative. Following the colonialists' introduction of English as the official language, Nigerians schooled in Arabic and Islamic education were suddenly rendered illiterate, which in turn limited and continues to limit access to economic opportunities - one of several factors attributed to the rise of Boko Haram. "In many places where [schools existed], it created a hierarchy of culture and knowledge where local languages, local knowledge systems were made secondary to this import," Gambo says, as she describes the destruction of Islamic education. "In colonising a society, you created an unequal society. People that went to school suddenly became powerful and [those] that didn't were disempowered." She also questions the Nigerian government's paltry investments in education, adding that schools can be viewed as a metaphor for the northeast's problems. "The school is an arm of the government. It's a power structure. The irony is not lost that Boko Haram is looking at the educational system as the root of its problems … as a symbol of all these Western promises that have not benefited them." Mental health and women's beauty Another artist whose work reflects the times is 25-year-old Olatunde Alara. His spray-painted installation "Smile", borne of his struggles with mental illness and being asked to smile when depressed, depicts the interior mind and exterior persona at odds with each other and the concept of misperception. Recalling earlier encounters with mental illness, Alara says he "couldn't put a definition to it because I didn't have any references, which is why representation is very important and it's important that I'm doing this". As Nigerian newspapers continue to refer to suicide as "despicable acts" and "ugly incidents", Alara hopes his installation will broaden conversations about mental health and encourage people to speak out about their experiences. Wura-Natasha Ogunji, meanwhile, questions the concept of women's beauty, its destruction and the dynamics of seeing and being seen in an art performance titled, "If I Loved You". Like Alara, Ogunji's performances, which mostly centre on the presence of women in public spaces, are inspired by her experiences. "I was very aware of division of labour … my own movement as a woman and how they were affected," recalls the 47-year-old, of her first visit to Nigeria in 2011. "I was very aware of people listening to me or not in public spaces. And so that became something I really wanted to engage with because of personal questions that I had with my own power, and my about own ability to engage with people and be present." Standing on a pedestal, the performers are presented as "objects of desire and focus and art objects [and] elevated beings" to the audience, with both parties having alternative viewpoints. Ogunji says her intention is not to effect a drastic change in the system but to slightly shift things for women, in this case, the performers, to experience freedom. "Art allows for that space in such a direct and eloquent manner," she says. 'Giving voice to the voiceless' Critic Wilfred Okiche says the Lagos event has expanded the space for uncomfortable topics to be discussed. "Art remains one of those mediums not totally shackled to the uneasy silence that conservative cultures usually seek to enforce," he says. "Art X has risen to the challenge of giving voice to the voiceless and starting edgy, important conversations in creative ways." As to whether artists addressing societal concerns in their work identify, as Fela Kuti did, as change agents - it depends on the artist. "[I] don't know what's going to happen [to the audience]. [I] don't know how someone is going to feel [about the art], or how they're going to be changed by what they observe," Ogunji says.

Gunfire and explosions erupted in Congo's eastern city of Bukavu, witnesses said, as Congolese troops clashed with those loyal to a renegade colonel. A Democratic Republic of Congo army spokesperson for South Kivu region, Dieudonne Kasereka, told Al Jazeera clashes started after police came to disarm Colonel Abbas Kayonga, who was sacked from his post on Thursday. Security has deteriorated across DRC since the end of last year, when President Joseph Kabila refused to step down despite his mandate expiring. Surging militia violence in the east - which for decades has been a tinderbox of ethnic rivalries fuelled by the region's mineral wealth - and in the formerly peaceful central Kasai region have raised fears the country could slip back to the multi-faceted civil wars of the turn of the century. Those wars killed hundreds of thousands of people while millions of others are thought to have died of hunger and disease. Kayonga is a former rebel from a group that was successfully disarmed and integrated into the Congolese military. "We are determined to arrest him and make him face justice," Kasereka said. Two security sources estimated the size of Kayonga's faction at about 40 men. The national electoral commission was expected to announce a date for the election to replace Kabila later on Sunday. Last month, it said the vote cannot take place until April 2019, raising fears of an escalation in violence and civil disturbances. US envoy Nikki Haley, after meeting with Kabila last month, said the vote must happen in 2018 or Congo will lose international support.

Uhuru Kenyatta was announced winner of the repeat presidential election on October 30 [Thomas Mukoya/Reuters] Nairobi, Kenya - The presidential poll rerun was meant to bring an end to the political crisis that has gripped Kenya since August but two days after the result was announced divisions appear to run deeper than ever. President Uhuru Kenyatta , who was declared winner of the poll with 98 percent of the vote, said during his victory speech on Monday that he expected his victory to be challenged. "My victory today is likely to be subjected to a constitutional test through the courts. And as I have demonstrated repeatedly, I will submit to this constitutional path no matter its outcomes," Kenyatta, the son of the country's founding father, said. Kenyatta was also declared the winner in August's poll, with 54 percent of the vote. The president's victory was challenged in the Supreme Court, which then annulled the result due to "illegalities and irregularities" in the voting process. His closest challenger in that poll, Raila Odinga, withdrew from the rerun, claiming the vote would not be free and fair. {articleGUID} Odinga, who despite withdrawing from the poll got 0.9 percent of Thursday's vote, said opposition demands for reforms at the electoral commission had not been met. Odinga has claimed Thursday's election was a "sham". "This election must not stand. If allowed to stand, it will make a complete mockery of elections and might well be the end of the ballot as a means of instituting government in Kenya. It will completely destroy public confidence in the vote," Odinga told reporters on Tuesday. In early October, the opposition leader said he would not go to court to challenge the result. Odinga, a former prime minister and son of the country's first vice president, has vowed to embark on a political campaign to "restore democracy in the country". He has called for the establishment of a "people's assembly", economic boycott and picketing, until fresh elections were held in the country. At least two petitions are currently in the court challenging the validity of Thursday's poll. The Supreme Court is expected to hear the cases in the coming weeks. Endless court cases, inflammatory rhetoric on the campaign trails and a poll boycott have left the country more divided than ever. "Elections are meant to be a nation-building exercise. They are meant to bring people closer. But this is not case here. The country is more divided than ever," John Githongo, Kenya's former anti-corruption chief, told Al Jazeera. Businesses are happy to see an end to the political gridlock that has chased away investors and choked the country's economy. "The market is on its knees. Investors don't want to put their money in a place where there are uncertainties and where there is political violence. The sooner the political crisis comes to an end the better for the business community and the country," Dismas Mokua, a political risk analyst, told Al Jazeera. {articleGUID} Polls were boycotted in 25 constituencies in the western part of the country, but the electoral board said the boycotts did not affect the outcome of the vote. More than 50 people have been killed in political violence since the August election was annulled. Opposition strongholds in western Kenya are still tense, with a heavy security presence. Analysts say only the courts can settle this crisis once and for all. "Odinga will not accept Kenyatta won the election. Kenyatta will not accept fresh election. The court needs to bring this to an end," Mokua said. SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Politics Kenya Uhuru Kenyatta Africa

South Sudan's President Salva Kiir reportedly agreed on a joint security force with Sudan [Phillip Dhil/EPA] Khartoum, Sudan - South Sudan's President Salva Kiir has arrived in Sudan to meet the president on a two-day trip aimed at resolving border disputes and discussing security issues. Kiir was welcomed by his Sudanese counterpart Omar al-Bashir on Wednesday, according to AFP news agency. South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in July 2011 after more than two decades of civil war, the longest-running conflict in African history. "There are a lot of agreements between us (Sudan and South Sudan), and now we have agreed to start implementing those agreements as they were signed," Awad bin Auf, Sudan's defence minister, told reporters after a meeting with an advance team from South Sudan on Sunday. "We have previously agreed to opening 10 border crossings between the two countries, and we will start by opening four crossings ... We have (also previously) agreed on a 20km demilitarised zone - 10km from each side," Bin Auf added. {articleGUID} Relations between the two nations have improved over the past few months. Only a year ago, Sudan was accusing South Sudan of hiding and harbouring Sudanese rebels on its soil. South Sudan also accused Khartoum of harbouring rebels which had been fighting the government in a civil war since 2013. Both said their respective rebels were on the others' border, crossing to their homeland to fight and retreating into the host nations. In 2012 - less than a year after South Sudan's independence - South Sudan invaded Sudan's oil-rich area of Heglig, making border security a contentious issue between the two countries. South Sudan said the invasion came after provocations from Sudan, as skirmishes between forces from the two sides regularly occurred along the nearly 2,000km border. A joint border monitoring mechanism has already been agreed upon, but with more than 50 percent of the border still under dispute, the implementation of the mechanism has been delayed. The process of demarcating the border is ongoing, with discussions mediated by the African Union in Addis Ababa. Abraham Mamer, a South Sudanese analyst, said the two countries, as result of their common history, remain deeply intertwined. "If they don't work together, there will be chaos, and there will be instability in the region. South Sudan must be stable for Sudan to be stable, and Sudan must be stable for South Sudan's stability," Mamer said. {articleGUID} The two countries, despite the 2011 secession, still rely on the same source of revenue: oil - specifically, South Sudan's oil, which accounts for 98 percent of its revenue. However, oil-producing South Sudan lacks the infrastructure to process its production. It is landlocked, forcing the young nation to use pipelines that go through Sudan to export its oil to the international market. As disagreements over the charges for using the pipelines escalated in 2012, South Sudan shut down its oil production, accusing Sudan of stealing its shipments. Sudan stated that it was only exercising its right, pointing to South Sudan's failure to pay for the use of its pipelines and processing facilities. The two later agreed on a fixed rate for the use of the facilities. "We will be having joint security for the oil fields so that workers can resume production in former Unity state, in Ruweng and Northern Liech states," Ezekiel Lol Gatkuoth, South Sudan's minister of petroleum told Al Jazeera. "There will be workers from Sudan coming to South Sudan, and they will need to be protected so both sides will form a joint security force." {articleGUID} South Sudan's civil war has resulted in the destruction of the country's northern oil fields, cutting down production to nearly a third, down from 350,000 barrels a day before the war. This has weakened South Sudan's economy as well as Sudan's, which relies on the processing and transportation fees for more than half of its gross domestic product (GDP). Other points of disagreements between the two countries, such as the disputed area of Abyei, will not be discussed, according to a South Sudanese presidential aide, saying that this was to not further complicate the agenda.

Yellow umbrellas have become a symbol of the 2014 pro-democracy protests [Photo courtesy: Hong Kong Free Press] Hundreds of people with yellow umbrellas surrounded government headquarters on Thursday to mark the third anniversary of the event that set off Hong Kong's biggest pro-democracy protests. Demonstrators re-enacted the moment when police had fired tear gas at thousands of students and pro-democracy activists, who shielded themselves with umbrellas that became a symbol of the protests . It was the night Hong Kong's hunger for democracy and the city's reputation for civil disobedience caught the attention of the rest of the world. But people have been taking to the streets long before the 79-day Umbrella protests of 2014, according to academic and political scientist, Joseph Cheng. "This idea of protest rallies really started in the 1980s. Previously, under the colonial administration people normally wouldn't take action to articulate their grievances, but that changed when Hong Kong's future came into question and the demand for democracy emerged in the 1980s." Cheng says the turning point was the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 when a million people took to the streets of Hong Kong . More than 1,000 people were reportedly killed after Chinese authorities sent army tanks on the streets of Beijing to suppress massive anti-government protests . Suddenly, people started questioning what a post-colonial future under China would be like, Cheng said. Hong Kong was a British colony until 1997, when it was handed over to China. Hong Kong's reputation for civil disobedience caught the attention of the rest of the world [Tyrone Siu/Reuters] It started the June 4th annual candlelight vigil. In 1989, I was one of the tens of thousands of students and citizens who held up flames to commemorate those killed in Beijing. For me and my classmates, it was an awakening, and perhaps the first time we saw people in Hong Kong come together for a cause that did not involve livelihood or finances. It was seen as a symbol of Hong Kong's unity, but over the years numbers have dwindled, and its message has become distorted by infighting among various pro-democracy factions. Aside from the Tiananmen protests, there have been other demonstrations that have become a fixture in the calendar of socially active people of Hong Kong. Like the July 1 marches. It started in 2003, when more than half a million people demonstrated to block the government's plan to impose stringent national security laws known as Article 23. The next big protest was in 2012. A 15-year-old boy led the fight against having a national curriculum introduced in schools. Joshua Wong later became the poster boy for Hong Kong's most famous pro-democracy protests, the Umbrella movement. Despite a new generation now growing up with a culture of protests, nobody expected the kind of sustained and explosive demonstrations that created the Occupy or Umbrella movement of 2014. Benny Tai, one of the cofounders of the Umbrella Movement, says it's unlikely people will take to the streets again on such a scale, mainly because of the government's harsh reaction. "Hong Kong has now entered an era of semi-authoritarianism and we can expect tougher suppression from the government. Exactly for this reason, before it becomes fully authoritarian or totalitarian, we must act to prevent it sliding back." Tai, a law professor at Hong Kong University, and the other two cofounders of the Umbrella Movement are currently on trial on charges of "public nuisance" for their part in the 2014 protests. If found guilty they could spend up to seven years in jail. The government has already imprisoned three of the student leaders that spearheaded the Umbrella movement. Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow have been sentenced to jail ranging from six to eight months. Protest leaders, from left, Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow have been jailed ranging from six to eight months [Vincent Yu/The Associated Press] That motivated tens of thousands of people to take to the streets on August 17 this year. This time, it wasn't just pro-democracy activists or students, but also families worried about their children's future. Forty-nine-year-old Eva Ho told Al Jazeera that she makes it a point to be part of the marches. "I keep attending these protests because I have the right to freedom of assembly and as citizens, we have a duty to speak up against injustices." She says despite it now being riskier for protesters, she encourages her 17-year-old son to take part in social movements so he knows what is happening in society. Jason Y Ng, lawyer and author of "Umbrellas in Bloom: Hong Kong's Occupy Movement Uncovered", says the culture of protest emerged due to the lack of democracy in Hong Kong, a city whose citizens cannot choose its own leader. It was the motivation for the Umbrella or the Occupy movement, which he says has forever changed society in this Chinese-governed territory. "Without a doubt, the most profound impact is the political awakening experienced by an entire generation of youths. For too long, young people in Hong Kong were sleepwalking through life, concerned only with material possessions and practical issues. "These days, by contrast, they are far more politically engaged and socially alert. The impact is not only profound but irreversible." He adds that although people's desire to express themselves may not be able to match the government's disproportionate reaction to suppress them. "The government's response towards protesters has been sweeping and indiscriminate, and the chilling effect on the opposition and civil society is far-reaching. Already pro-democracy political parties are experiencing difficulties recruiting new members. The proverbial kitchen is getting way too hot for regular citizens." The question now is how much heat the government is planning to put on those who take to the streets. Hong Kong is the only city in China where people can freely hold protests, activists say with the government's current rate of punishing those who do, it's just a matter of time before the so-called Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong becomes like the rest of the country.

Ming Gor uses his boat for cultural tours to promote Tanka heritage the Tanka identity [Divya Gopalan/Al Jazeera] Hong Kong - When the British first arrived in Hong Kong in the 19th century, they came across a group of indigenous people on fishing boats and asked them what the place was called. "Hong Kong," those people replied. The name stuck, but the culture and the language weren't as resilient. Hong Kong is the Tanka words for "fragrant harbour". The language is spoken by people who call themselves "Soi Seung Yan", meaning "those born of the water". They were the earliest inhabitants of the region in coastal southern China . Fifty-year-old Ming Gor is one of the last fluent speakers of the Tanka language. Until 2004, he lived on a boat and was a fisherman just like his father and grandfather. But stringent environmental laws and government policy made it difficult to earn a living on the South China Sea , forcing him to move to land with his family. He says it's a familiar story in his community, which has been rapidly disappearing over the past few decades. Lisa Lim is a linguistics professor at Hong Kong University and founder of the website linguisticsminorities.hk. Her research found that discriminatory practices in the 18th century preserved the Tanka culture. The people were not allowed to marry in the community or live onshore, so they lived on small boats grouped together to form colonies.

Younger generations have moved onshore, to urban areas, for better job opportunities and easier lifestyle. Historically considered the lowest class of Chinese and outcasts, the Tanka were quick to shed their identity once they started assimilating with the wider Cantonese community. But not Ming Gor. He now uses his boat for cultural tours to promote Tanka heritage and to promote the Tanka identity. "Tanka fisherman had such low social status in Hong Kong that their long history and contribution to society has been overlooked. I want this to change and tell the world that we once were here." Bring back the Hakka It's a similar story for the Hakka community, according to Lau Chun-Fat, a Hakka academic campaigning to preserve dialects and languages from extinction. After studying to work as a biologist in Germany , he returned to his village in Yuen Long in 1993. His dismay at finding out nobody spoke Hakka led him back to university to pursue a career as a Hakka scholar. "My village is a very small one, it has 100 inhabitants," he said. "In the whole village, I'm the only one who speaks to my children in Hakka. The older generation know Hakka, but they speak to their children in Cantonese." The Hakka came to Hong Kong about 300 years ago and settled in what was then rural New Territories. Hakka grandmother and grandson in Po Kat Tsai village in Fanling, New Territories [Amy Ip Ka Man/Al Jazeera] Until 1945, they were one of four main native groups in the territory. That changed when the civil war in China sent more than a million Cantonese refugees across the border into the British colony between 1945 and 1951. It was also during this period that the colonial government closed all village schools that were teaching in the various indigenous languages. They opened new institutions that only taught in Cantonese. His first day of school was the first time he heard the southern Chinese dialect. This, according to Lau, signalled a shift in their culture. Many parents felt their children would have better opportunities if they assimilated with the Cantonese. Naomi Wong, 40, works for a trading company in the city but lives in the Hakka village house she grew up in with her parents. Her 80-year-old father gets emotional when asked about the language. He told us that Hakka is a language full of wisdom and should not be forgotten. But his daughter says her generation find it easier to communicate in Cantonese. Naomi and her group of Hakka friends can understand the language and use it when they talk to their parents and the older generation. In conversation with each other, they use Cantonese. There is no official government campaign to promote or preserve indigenous languages. The Hong Kong government does not differentiate among the various Chinese ethnicities, so there are no official records to document the different communities. Lau is despondent when we asked about his efforts to revive Hakka language and culture. "I just want people to know that Hakka existed in Hong Kong and still exists in some parts. I know it is practically impossible to make Hakka last forever here, but I want to make it known to people that Hakka was once an integral part of Hong Kong and its culture."

Refugees protest at the Manus Island prison camp in Papua New Guinea [Refugee Action Coalition via AP] Port Macquarie, Australia - Refugees say supplies of food and water are running desperately low inside the former Australian-run refugee detention centre on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island. Almost 600 men refusing to leave because of a perceived lack of security are now drinking water extracted from a well they dug in the sand. The toilets are blocked, and they fear dysentery may soon spread. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has called on Australia to take immediate action to stop what it has called an "unfolding humanitarian emergency". But immediate action from Australia does not appear forthcoming. The story is not, by any measure, leading every news bulletin. Despite restrictions on reporting from the centre, there has, however, been more interest in the plight of these men this week than there has been in months. Still, large sections of the public are hostile to the cases of these men; many others are just apathetic. It's that pervading apathy - and sense of desperation among pro-refugee advocates - that led 55-year-old Australian Phoebe Crane to go on a hunger strike more than a month ago. I fly to the small coastal town of Port Macquarie, an hour's flight north of Sydney, where the former mental health worker is in her fourth week of subsisting only on teas, coffee, and electrolyte-rich coconut water. "I'm starting to feel really weak," Crane says, adding she was medically and psychologically assessed before beginning her fast.

I've done all that. In the end, this matter became so urgent for me that I thought I had to go on hunger strike. Something that Aussies don't usually do." With her husband, she launched a small media campaign. Press releases were written, emails sent to a large number of newsrooms. But not one major media organisation has picked up on Phoebe's story. Journalists and editors are divided as to why. At a typically small rally for refugees in Sydney this week, a journalist from an international news agency tells me it is because Phoebe is an hour's flight from Sydney. Times are tough; it's too expensive to travel. I'm not sure. Skype has become standard, even in TV reporting. I get a steer from a reporter at a respected news organisation who has had the "asylum round" of late. When refugees themselves have gone on hunger strike in the past, it has made the news. Why not this middle-aged woman living an otherwise comfortable life? Phoebe Crane went on a hunger strike to draw attention to the plight of the refugees imprisoned on Manus Island [Bill Code/Al Jazeera] The reporter was aware of Phoebe's case but gave it a wide berth. After covering hunger strikers in the past, other "copycat" hunger strikers emerged. It wasn't something the reporter wanted to risk. I try and find out why the ABC, which has a bureau in Port Macquarie, has not covered the story. I'm told that while Phoebe was on the radar, talk of "self-harm" and issues surrounding women, food, and body image were raised before shying away from the story. Australian outlets are careful when it comes to issues of reporting self-harm. But the country's press council guidelines stress that publications have "wide discretion" in publishing. "But," it goes on "they should balance the public interest with the sensibilities of their readers." An experienced foreign correspondent who has worked for ABC rubbishes concerns around body image and self-harm. "There's total self-censorship in the Australian media on refugee issues," she says. "They don't want to offend the government and have a Senate inquiry talking about how left-leaning the ABC is." "The term 'advocate' has become a pejorative in Australia," she goes on to say. The government has run a "brilliant' campaign keeping journalists away from refugees and asylum seekers - and the public thus emotionally removed from their plight. {articleGUID} "Australians like to think of offshore detention as an 'exception', but it is not. It has become standard operating procedure," says Peter Mares, an adjunct professor at Swinburne University in Melbourne, a long-time journalist who has written two books on Australia and migration. Even he was "surprised" Phoebe's story had not received more coverage. "If it's a political protest which she is doing out of conviction, I don't see why it shouldn't be reported. We become used to things; things become normalised… We become inured to the impact of the policy," he says. But with the growing crisis, there has, finally, been a resurgence of interest, albeit measured. For her part, Phoebe says she is now being contacted by some refugees asking her to stop fasting, for her own sake.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull with his Zealand counterpart Jacinda Ardern in Sydney on Sunday [David Gray/Reuters] Sydney, Australia - Papua New Guinea's immigration minister has told Al Jazeera Australia must "immediately facilitate" a New Zealand offer to take 150 refugees formerly detained in an Australian prison camp on its Manus Island. The strong words came as New Zealand's prime minister said on Sunday the offer remains alive during a bilateral press conference in Australia, even as its prime minister declined to accept. Almost 600 men have refused to leave the prison they were detained in until October 31 when food, water, and electricity were cut off. They say moving to other accommodation on the island - as Australian and PNG authorities are urging them to do - would put them at risk of attacks by locals. They also dispute Australian government claims that alternative facilities are ready to live in. On her first foreign visit as leader, New Zealand's newly elected Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern reiterated her country's four-year-old pledge to take the refugees. {articleGUID} "We of course do not have the circumstances that Australia is working under, but we also cannot ignore the human face of what Australia is dealing with as well, so the offer is very genuine and absolutely remains on the table as well," Ardern said. As expected, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull stated Australia wouldn't be taking up the New Zealand offer, at least not in the short-term. "The offer has been re-stated. We thank New Zealand for making that offer. We are not taking it up at this time for the reasons I explained earlier," he said. An alternative settlement deal with the United States was enacted in September, while the Australian government says another costly resettlement plan with Cambodia remains alive, despite only having been taken up by a handful of refugees. The original New Zealand offer, made in 2013, laid the ground for 150 refugees to be resettled from Australia to its smaller neighbour annually. Following a change of government in Australia, it was never enacted. "PNG will very much appreciate NZ assistance in this regard," Immigration Minister Petrus Thomas told Al Jazeera, but the country "had gone silent in the process". PNG, he said, had given a "helping hand" and identified refugees from non-refugees . "It's now Australia's responsibility to settle them in a third country." Al Jazeera asked Ardern if New Zealand would sidestep Australia and deal with New Zealand directly. "No, because the offer is still under active consideration by Australia so there is no need to do so," she said.

Refugees protesting against Australian and PNG governments [Al Jazeera] Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has rejected Wellington's offer to resettle refugees in New Zealand . Turnbull snubbed New Zealand's renewed offer to resettle 150 refugees illegally held at remote Pacific camps despite the closure of one detention centre in Papua New Guinea , which has triggered a standoff between refugees and the Australian authorities. The issue re-emerged when the Australian prime minister met his New Zealand counterpart Jacinda Ardern for the first time Sunday in Sydney. Canberra has been forced on the defensive by the move from Wellington's new government, with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull saying Australia would instead prioritise a similar deal with the US to resettle refugees in the US, despite slow progress. Australia had come under fire from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , with a spokesman in Geneva Friday calling on Canberra to move the refugees from Manus to Australia and criticising the offshore asylum processing policy as "unsustainable, inhumane and contrary to its human rights obligations". "We urge the governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea to fully respect their human rights ... and to enter into a dialogue with the men to ensure these rights are duly respected, protected and fulfilled," the spokesman added. About 600 detainees are refusing to leave citing safety fears if they move to transition centres where locals are reportedly unwelcoming. But conditions in the camp are deteriorating with limited food and water and electricity cut off, with the United Nations warning of a humanitarian emergency. Under its strict immigration policy, Canberra sends asylum seekers who try to reach Australia by boat to two camps, in Manus and Nauru, and they are barred from ever resettling in Australia. Australia has struggled to move the refugees to third countries, such as Cambodia or Papua New Guinea. "The offer is very genuine and remains on the table," Ardern told reporters after meeting Turnbull. But the Australian leader replied that while he appreciated the offer, first made by Wellington in 2013, "we are not taking it up at this time." "We have an arrangement with the United States ... so we want to pursue those, conclude those arrangements and then in the wake of that, obviously we can consider other ones," he said at the joint press conference. Under the American deal, struck with previous US President Barack Obama and bitterly criticised by his successor Donald Trump , just 54 refugees have been accepted, with 24 flown to the US . The agreement had envisaged resettling up to 1,250 refugees from Manus and Nauru to the US, but the vetting process has been slow. Turnbull said his government had successfully stopped the arrival of asylum seeker boats and cited fears the people-smuggling trade could be restarted. "Many of those people smugglers were trying to get people to New Zealand," he added. Despite widespread criticism, Canberra has defended its policy.

Demonstrators took to the streets of Sydney and Melbourne in support of the 600 men on Manus Island [File: David Gray/Reuters] Hundreds of Australians protested on Saturday against the treatment of 600 refugees who are refusing to leave a former prison on Manus Island for fear of being attacked by locals. In a crackdown against "boat people" arriving in the country, Australia set up prison camps in the Pacific islands of Manus and Nauru in Papua New Guinea (PNG), nearly five years ago, to process asylum seekers. The United Nations and human rights defenders have condemned the treatment of asylum seekers amid allegations of rights abuses, and demanded the camps be shut down. The Manus Island facility was decommissioned on Tuesday, but the 600 men there barricaded themselves in without food and water in defiance of Australian and PNG authorities. They are asking other countries to take them in. "We are pleading the international community to rescue us," said asylum seeker Abdul Azziz Adam in a video message from the camp in Papua New Guinea. "What is going on on Manus Island at the moment is a humanitarian crisis and no one will help us." The men have resorted to drinking rain water and have dug their own wells in order to survive. The UN has called the crisis an "unfolding humanitarian emergency". {articleGUID} Australia's government says the 600 men have been offered alternative accommodation elsewhere on Manus Island, but the refugees say it is not safe from locals who want to do them harm. Many asylum seekers have been attacked in the past by Papuans who do not want them on the island. New Zealand has offered to take in 150 asylum seekers, and its Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will arrive in Sydney on Sunday to discuss the situation with her counterpart, Malcolm Turnbull. So far, Australia has rejected the offer. "We are begging the New Zealand government to rescue us because New Zealand is the only country today, they have been fighting again and again and again, they want to get us out of detention centre," Adam said in the video message. Al Jazeera's Andrew Thomas, who attended a protest rally in Sydney on Saturday, said the central message among the crowd was for the government to "bring them here". "I think the situation on Manus Island is completely and utterly deplorable," a young, male demonstrator told Al Jazeera. "I think it's really important that the government takes a stand … so we can bring these men who are scared and suffering to Australia." Hundreds of protesters also converged in Australia's second-largest city, Melbourne, on Saturday.

Typhoon Damrey hits Vietnam [Vietnam News Agency/AFP] At least 19 people have died and a dozen are missing after Typhoon Damrey barreled into Vietnam , just days before the country welcomes world leaders to the APEC summit. The storm made landfall on Saturday and is the worst to hit the southern coastal region in decades. Heavy rains inundated communities with floods as 130 km/h winds blew off roofs and knocked down electricity poles, according to Vietnam's search and rescue office. Coastal Khanh Hoa province, home to the popular white sand Nha Trang beach, was hardest hit with 14 dead and 10 injured, the government said. More than 30,000 people, including foreign tourists, were evacuated from the area in advance of the storm. A dozen flights were also cancelled while railway services were suspended - local authorities in Phu Yen province said Tuy Hoa city "has never suffered such devastation". There were also reports of minor damage around 500km north in Danang, the coastal city where Vietnam will host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit next week. The week-long gathering, which kicks off Monday, will bring together leaders including US President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping . Vietnam has been bashed by a dozen major storms since the start of 2017, with at least 240 people reported dead or missing in floods and landslides . In September, some 80 were killed after Typhoon Doksuri battered central provinces with rain, destroying thousands of homes and triggering severe floods. The World Bank said natural disasters have killed more than 13,000 people and caused more than $6.4bn in property damage to Vietnam over the past two decades.

Some far-right Hindu groups have portrayed interfaith marriages as a Muslim conspiracy to destroy Hinduism in India [Mujeeb Faruqui/Hindustan Times via Getty Images] Hadiya is finally going to be heard - a right that was denied to her by her parents, her community and even the highest court in her home state of Kerala. India's Supreme Court on Monday said that consent of an adult for marriage is prime - a verdict that women's rights activists have been waiting for. The top court also directed the police in the southern state to present Hadiya in the court in New Delhi on November 27. "I think the Supreme Court's observations saying they want to find out what Hadiya thinks is a welcome order. She is an adult woman, she has to be treated as such," said Vrinda Grover, Supreme Court lawyer and women's rights activist. {articleGUID} Akhila Ashokan, now known as Hadiya, had adopted the Islamic faith and married a Muslim man Shafin Jahan in December 2016. She had been confined to her father's house in Kottayam since May, when the Kerala High Court annulled her marriage. Her father, KM Ashokan, angered by his daughter's decision, had petitioned the Kerala High Court, alleging that his daughter had been forcibly converted and was being held against her will. "When an adult woman, even if she marries a convicted terrorist, that is her right. The Kerala High Court's annulment of her marriage is wholly without jurisdiction. She should not be confined in this manner, only a criminal can be," Supreme Court lawyer Karuna Nundy told Al Jazeera. On August 16, the Supreme Court had ordered a probe by the country's "anti-terror" agency into whether the marriage was part of a "Love Jihad" conspiracy or whether the woman converted to Islam of her own free will. "I am concerned that with the next date of hearing a month away, she will have to suffer and live with her parents against her wishes," Grover said. 'Love Jihad' myth Far-right Hindu groups allege that "Love Jihad" is a conspiracy by Muslim groups to lure Hindu women into marriages with Muslim men and to convert them to Islam. The court was hearing a petition by Hadiya's husband, Jahan, which said the high court order was an "insult to the independence of the women of India as it completely takes away their right to think for themselves". India's top probe body, the National Investigative Agency (NIA) are looking into Jahan's allegedly "radical" views and his suspected links to banned Islamic groups. "The Hadiya case is fast emerging as one case I have been watching with growing discomfort and anger," said activist Harnidh Kaur. She said that the case paints an entire minority community as "aggressors and manipulators", referring to allegations of "Love Jihad". "To even assume there's some sort of 'Love Jihad' is atrocious, and to think that the SC continues this charade of paying heed to the idea is extremely disheartening." The top court's observations on Monday however, provided some succour to Jahan. Activist Rahul Easwar released a video last week that showed Hadiya pleading for her freedom and stating that her life is under threat at her father's house. "You have to get me out fast. I am sure I will be killed tomorrow or day after. My father is getting angry, I know. When I walk, he is pushing and kicking me," Hadiya says in the video. Women's rights groups, including the Kerala Women's Commission, have asked for a police probe into Hadiya's present living conditions.

At least 2,600 children have died at the hospital since January [Al Jazeera] Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, India - In the early afternoon of August 22, Pawan Tiwari and his wife Rinki sobbed inconsolably in front of the Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College in the northern Indian city of Gorakhpur. "Oh, my boy, oh, my boy," wailed Tiwari's wife Rinki while sitting on the floor. Parents of other children at the hospital tried to comfort the couple sitting outside in the shade of a tree. Doctors had informed Pawan, 35, that his six-year-old child, Naitik Tiwari, was dead. But shortly afterward, Pawan's brother, Anjan Tiwari, emerged from the hospital to tell him that his son was still breathing and doctors were struggling to save him. The couple rushed inside the ward. They peeked through the glass window of the paediatric intensive care unit to look at their son, their eyes swollen from crying. As Pawan and his wife left the ward, his brother broke down. He told me that he had given them false hope; a doctor had told him that the child was unlikely to survive. In August, the deaths of more than 60 children over five days at the hospital in northern Uttar Pradesh (UP) state, allegedly due to oxygen failure, caused public uproar . Children have died from infections and conditions such as Japanese encephalitis. Naitik was among the 415 children who died in the month of August, according to the official data provided by the largest government hospital in the region. Deaths of children at the BRD hospital 2014 - 1,845 2015 - 2,132 2016 - 2,729 January-October 2017 - 2,600 In the first 23 days of this month at least 354 children, including 231 newborns, have died, taking the death toll to more than 1,000 since August. Most of the children who arrive at the hospital are malnourished newborns, Dr PK Singh, the college principal, had told Al Jazeera in August. Flooding in the region - in eastern UP and western Bihar states - has caused widespread infections, he added. "Children are already infected; they die in the first hour of admission. The patient load is too much, nearly 4,000 patients are coming daily. We can't refuse to admit them," he said, adding that staff place multiple children onto a single bed. There is one doctor for every 17 patients, he said, when a normal ratio should be one for every ten. "In our country, the neonatal mortality rate per 1,000 live births is 27 but in UP it's 43. Most of the deaths at neonatal stage are due to breathing problems. The next big cause is infection," said Professor KP Kushwaha, a former principal of BRD Medical College. "By the time the infants arrive at the hospital their condition is already in critical stage. It becomes difficult to save infants at this stage," said Kushwaha, a renowned pediatrician, adding that the institutional approach toward neonatal care must be overhauled, to include specialised care in primary and community health centres across the region. A woman looks into the intensive care unit (ICU) at the Baba Raghav Das hospital [Cathal McNaughton/Reuters] The deaths at BRD, the only major state-run hospital in a 200km radius has put a focus - in a country that spends only 1.2 percent of its GDP on public health - on a facility that cannot adequately care for its patients and the wider, impoverished region that desperately needs the government to provide healthcare infrastructure. {articleGUID} Vandana Prasad, the national convener of People's Health Movement - India, a network of 1,000 non-government organisations, told Al Jazeera it is a "failure of the entire system". "I take the point that some children come to BRD medical college in critical condition, but what has been done to address this situation? Why wasn’t health infrastructure at primary and community health centres strengthened [by the government]?" she asked. "The BRD medical college needed improvement, as it faces shortage of doctors, beds and ventilators. Why were not these issues fixed?" The People's Health Movement – India said in a statement about the deaths at BRD: "The entire country has been horrified at the recent deaths…This is the net result of decades of grossly inadequate investment in the public health sector and services... This drastic situation, compounded by misgovernance, mismanagement and corruption has been a powder keg just waiting to ignite year after year, with the resultant loss of innocent lives." Patients face long waits Naitik first developed a fever on August 10. He initially responded well to medicines but later complained of a stomach ache. His parents took him to private clinics in their home district of Gopalgunj, where doctors diagnosed him with typhoid fever. A week later, as his fever continued, local doctors referred him to BRD Medical College. {articleGUID} Pawan, a garment factory worker in the western state of Gujarat and the main breadwinner for his family, had travelled more than 100km from his village of Khatwanian in the neighbouring state of Bihar to reach the hospital. He hired a local taxi and left for the hospital with his son, wife and brother on the night of August 18. Naitik was admitted to hospital that night, but doctors said he should have come earlier. In medical terms, his condition was critical. "We will do our best. Have faith in God," the doctors had promised a distraught Pawan. The day after I met Pawan and his wife, at 11.30 the next morning, I went to visit Naitik at bed number 15 in the paediatric ward. He wasn't there. There was another child in his place. No one could tell me what had happened to Naitik. His parents weren't there. Later the hospital officials confirmed the child died of encephalitis. "The entire country has been horrified at the recent deaths…This is the net result of decades of grossly inadequate investment in the public health sector and services. The People's Health Movement – India I went to the outpatient department where about 200 people were in the queue, waiting to see a doctor. Among them was Ramawati, 65, who was with her 30-year-old daughter. They live two kilometres away and had already been waiting in the queue for two hours. Seventy-year-old Dashrath Prasad had travelled 80km for a follow-up appointment. He stood in the humid, narrow hospital corridor, dabbing the sweat from his balding head with a white cotton towel draped over his right shoulder. The clerk registering the patients sweated profusely. Every now and then, he stood up to reprimand patients who tried to cut the queue. Dashrath, wearing a dhoti - an unstitched piece of cloth worn around the waist - and a kurta (a shirt), had come 15 days after his blood pressure shot up. But the last doctor who saw him was on leave and Dashrath was forced to register again. Meanwhile, Dashrath has still not seen the doctor after standing in a queue for three hours. The patients complained of long waits and indifferent staff. They lamented that one day goes by before they see a doctor; another day if diagnostic tests are required. "I spent Rs 80 ($1.25) to reach the hospital. An entire day will take to see a doctor," Dashrath said angrily. "Poor management by the hospital administration is killing patients." Overworked doctors Doctors said they were overworked as the hospital was understaffed. Between 9am to 2pm, outpatient doctors said they see between 200 to 300 patients. "We work under so much pressure due to the high number of patients that we are not even able to discuss about the diseases with resident doctors. This is a teaching hospital, we are also required to research on diseases but most of our time goes into seeing patients," said a resident doctor from the orthopedic department, who declined to be named. "We work under so much pressure due to the high number of patients that we are not even able to discuss about the diseases with resident doctors. A resident doctor From the clerks registering patients to the staff involved in diagnostic work, such as blood tests and X-rays, staff said they were overwhelmed and there are far more patients than the hospital can handle. "We work in three shifts, conducting at least 600 diagnostic tests in 24 hours," Sanjay Mishra, head of the central pathology department, told Al Jazeera. By 11.30am, 1,750 patients were already registered at the four counters in the outpatient department, two staff in the radiology department had conducted more than 80 X-rays, while the central pathology department - dealing with blood and sputum tests - had 105 patients on its registers. In the orthopedic section, patient number 120 was summoned. The medicine department had already administered prescriptions for 220 patients. At the gate of Nehru Hospital at BRD, many patients arrived by autorickshaw, rather than an ambulance. This is the situation, year-round, at BRD Medical College. In the central record room located on the second floor of Nehru Hospital, 35-year-old Suleman Khan, who is head of record keeping, sits at his desk. Files are piled all over the room. Khan says last year, 605,226 patients visited the outpatient department while 60,891 were admitted for additional care. By July 31 of this year, the outpatient department had seen 317,555 patients and admitted 33,047 people. In the past four years, the number of patients has grown by almost one and a half times what it once was. "Every year the number of patients is increasing. The months of August, September and October see a spike in patient intake," he said, referring to the rainy season months. The deaths of more than 60 children in August allegedly due to oxygen failure caused public uproar [Cathal McNaughton/Reuters] Underserviced region The college, named after freedom fighter and educationist, Baba Raghav Das, was established in 1969 as the state's eighth medical college. It began with a total of 50 students and later increased to 100. Today, there are still only 100 student spots. The number of resident doctors who see the patients has marginally increased from 36 to 54, while the number of patients has increased manifold. In a 2012 report, Professor Radhamohan Misra - a former vice chancellor of the college and convener of Gorakhpur Health Forum, a public health monitor - said that patients from 14 districts in eastern Uttar Pradesh and five districts from Bihar come to BRD for consultation. Today, BRD is the only tertiary healthcare centre in a region of over 60 million people straddling Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Patients from neighbouring Nepal also seek treatment there. There are plans to upgrade the neonatal intensive care unit, but doctors in the paediatric department say it won't be enough to keep pace with the demand for more facilities. Last year, work on upgrading BRD began. A new medical college was inaugurated by the government of Prime Minister of Narendra Modi in July last year. About 130km away from Gorakhpur, in the village of Khatwanian in Gopalgunj district, the Pawan family is still grieving the loss of Naitik. Pawan was outside his house, his head shaved as part of the mourning ritual. "It is our misfortune, I do not feel like talking about it now," he said. "I buried my son near Chhathi Maiya (a local deity worshipped for long life for children)," he said. "I have removed all his belongings, but his face does not go away from my eyes," Pawan said. His wife Rinki has not been able to come to terms with the death of her elder child; they have a three-year-old daughter Anshikha. Family members said she had grown weak due to crying. The family is under debt due to the medical costs that have crossed 100,000 Indian rupees ($1,543). "I will sell my two bigha (.50 hectare) land to clear the debt," Pawan told Al Jazeera sitting inside the hut in front of his incomplete house, still without the main door.

Pro-independence activists at a Srinagar protest hold banners opposing the plea filed against Article 35A [Baba Tamim/Al Jazeera] Srinagar, India-administered Kashmir – People in Kashmir have their eyes on India's Supreme Court, which is set to hear a plea against Article 35A that gives special status to Indian-administered Kashmir. Altaf Sheikh, owner of a popular cafe at Srinagar's Residency Road - the busiest shopping street in the main city of the disputed region - is worried that India's Hindu nationalist government wants to bring about demographic change in the Muslim-majority territory. Hindu nationalists have campaigned against Article 35A enshrined in India's constitution that bars Indians from buying land in the disputed region. Sheikh, like other Kashmiris, fears New Delhi wants to settle outsiders and reduce Muslims to a minority. "Examples of Palestine, Syria, and now Rohingya are before us. Will the world afford Kashmir becoming one of these in the future?" he asks. An NGO called "We the Citizens" and a think-tank backed by Hindu supremacist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) have filed a plea to remove the article. The Congress party, that has ruled India for most of the past seven decades, had challenged such petitions whenever they were filed in the past. India couldn't change the demography of Kashmir politically or militarily. Now, it's using its judiciary card Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, separatist leader But the federal government, led by the right-wing Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), which also rules disputed Kashmir in alliance with regional People's Democratic Party (PDP), hasn't contested the petition, raising fears in Kashmir that the party is finally on its way to abolish these provisions using judicial means. A new storm is looming over the region that has seen unrest in the past three years amid hardline policies pushed by the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi . "I worry about the future of my children. We have already faced worst war crimes here. Kashmiris may mass-migrate," said Iftikhar Ahmad, an autorickshaw driver. "But our borders with Pakistan are landmined. Where will we immigrate to?" he asked. Property rights to the outsiders Article 35A provision was introduced through a presidential order in 1954 to continue the old provisions of the territory regulations under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution - which denies property rights to the outsiders in the region and allows Kashmir to have its own constitution and a separate flag. The provisions continue from the time when Kashmir was a separate kingdom ruled by Hindu Dogra rulers. In 1947, when the British colonialists vacated the subcontinent, Maharaja Hari Singh signed the instrument of accession with India that was disputed by Pakistan . In its original shape, constitutional laws like Article 35A and Article 370 prohibited Indians or any foreigner from entering Kashmir without a permit. Later, such laws were watered down. So, when a Hindu nationalist politician, Syama Prasad Mookerjee , the founding father of Bharatiya Jana Sangh and a precursor to the ruling BJP - entered the state in 1953 without a permit, he was arrested and died in prison. Mookerjee's death offered an impetus for the BJP to work on the elimination of Article 35A and Article 370 that continues till today. "We stand by his (Mookerjee's) sacrifices. We'll never back down from his commitment to these provisions," senior BJP leader Ashok Kaul told Al Jazeera. {articleGUID} Under Article 370, India was supposed to control only communication, foreign office and defence of Kashmir, but over the decades New Delhi has eroded many of the special provisions. The PDP government in the state, however, is defending the Article in the top court, which will hear the case on Monday. "We have a strong case. We will strengthen the status of the state, not diminish it," the PDP spokesperson Waheed Ur Rehman Parra told Al Jazeera. When asked that its coalition partner BJP was not challenging the petitions, Parra said, "Both parties intend to work for peace and integration". "… You may differ in a democracy. We are two different ideologies but it doesn't mean we can't co-exist together." The PDP has received criticism for its handling of the issue. Senior advocate Syed Tassadque Hussain criticised the PDP for its handling of the issue [Baba Tamim/Al Jazeera] Senior advocate Syed Tassadque Hussain told Al Jazeera that PDP is "ill-prepared" to fight the case. 'Right to revolt' Likening a US Supreme Court judgment in a petition regarding a case on civil rights of Indian tribes, Hussain said, "the US court ruled that the question has already been adjudged and is barred by the principals of res judicata to re-examine it." Res Judicata means "the matter has already been adjudged" and is sometimes evoked by the courts to dismiss the case for being useless. "The Kashmir government should have used this case as counter-argument," he said adding, "also under Res Judicata principle, the Indian court lacks jurisdiction on this case." Hussain doesn't rule out major revolt in Kashmir if the court removes these provisions. "Situation will arise which arose in the Dred Scott case in the US. That means although the law declared by the top court is binding upon all authorities within the territory of India, yet people have a right to revolt." The pro-independence groups say they will call for "massive rage in Kashmir streets" the day the provision is removed. "We've called for a massive agitation," pro-resistance leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq told Al Jazeera. "India couldn't change the demography of Kashmir politically or militarily. Now, it's using its judiciary card," said Farooq, the head of the moderate faction of All Parties Hurriyat Conference. Farooq added that the Indian court doesn't have "any jurisdiction in the disputed territory". Kashmiris fear demographic changes are part of New Delhi's plan to alter the outcome of a future plebiscite in favour of India if it's ever conducted to settle the sovereignty of Kashmir disputed by India and Pakistan, who govern parts of the territory since 1947. {articleGUID} Majority of Kashmiris want independence or merger with Pakistan to be decided by UN-brokered plebiscite. Nearly 70,000 people, mostly civilians have been killed since 1989, when the armed uprising erupted. Future plebiscite Armed groups have largely been suppressed by the Indian security forces in recent years. More than half a million Indian troops are stationed in the region where the opposition to Indian rule is now mainly expressed through street protests. A prominent Kashmiri Hindu leader Sanjay Tickoo also echoed the line many Kashmiri leaders and activists have raised. "It's a bigger game people must understand," Tickoo, who is based in Srinagar, told Al Jazeera. An estimated 100,000 Hindus – locally called Kashmiri Pandits - fled the region following the start of the fighting in 1989. "The impact will of an atomic bomb if these provisions are removed," Tickoo, who heads an organisation that looks after the welfare of Hindus who remain in Kashmir, said. "The first to suffer will be Hindus of Jammu, whose businesses and properties will be taken over by the influx of rich Indians," he said referring to southern Jammu city, where most of the Kashmiri Hindu community fled to. For common Kashmiris, as Sheikh Showkat, who teaches international relations at a local university, put it: "It's a matter of life and death." "Palestinian territory has been changed by Israel through Jewish settlements. These provisions are a legal impediment in the way of creating settlements in Kashmir."

Chinese President Xi Jinping at the opening of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing [Aly Song/Reuters] The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the world's largest political party as well as one of the longest ruling. With a membership of almost 90 million, it is larger than the population of most countries in the world. It has thus far been able to withstand strong challenges caused by rapid social and economic change as well as the fallout from the collapse of the Soviet bloc and the Soviet Communist Party. In fact, in recent years the CCP has strengthened and centralised its grip, reaching into every corner of Chinese society. Through an internal and rigorous appointment system the Party also controls the Chinese political system at all administrative levels and from the basic township level up to the national level, no leader is appointed without the consent of the CCP. For these reasons, the current 19th Party Congress is a major event whose significance can be compared with the US presidential election. At the congress, or rather at the first meeting of the new Central Committee elected at the congress, the CCP's current leader, Xi Jinping , will be appointed general-secretary for a new five-year period. At the National People's Congress in March next year, he will also be reappointed president of the People's Republic of China. He will also continue as chairman of the powerful military commission and of a number of other important commissions and leading groups. Xi Jinping has been called the most powerful leader since Deng Xiaoping. But actually, Xi Jinping's way of ruling China is fundamentally different from Deng Xiaoping. Deng was never formally number one in the party or in the government apparatus. He held informal power and ruled from behind and, in fact, seldom participated in formal meetings. Xi Jinping is Chairman of Everything and micromanages China in a way that separates him from previous party leaders in China. This is both his strength and weakness. China has not turned capitalist under Xi. When Xi Jinping, in 2012, was appointed general-secretary of the CCP, China was in the middle of a deep political crisis. Important Party leaders such as Bo Xilai were plotting to advance their own career based on populist campaigns and were protected by the powerful security tsar and member of the standing committee Zhou Yongkang. In the military, top generals were engaged in severe corruption , which among other things involved buying and selling of positions. Former party leaders such as Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin saw the writing on the wall and gave Xi Jinping green light to clean up the political system and the military establishment. Xi has used this to conduct an intensive anti-corruption campaign, which, so far, has involved hundreds of thousands of CCP cadres and has resulted in the purge of more than 200 ministerial-level officials. Less known is his campaign to create a party where the focus is on quality rather than quantity. The growth of the party has been reduced and new and strict rules for recruiting and training party members have been implemented, including regulations for demoting and disciplining Party cadres. Xi has also spearheaded a centralisation of Party leadership. He has emphasised that the Party should be presented at all levels and in all types of organisations, agencies and enterprises in China. Even private and foreign-funded companies are now required to have a Party committee, which has to be consulted on major issues regarding running the company. He is also stressing a policy of overlapping positions between Party and state and between Party and business, so that the Party secretary in a province or county also serves as chairman of the local people's congress and the Party secretary in a state-owned company also serves as chairman of the board. {articleGUID} This process has evolved to such an extent that some analysts have started talking about the stratification of the Party. In his recent speech to the Party congress, Xi emphasised that "Party and government bodies at the provincial, prefectural and county levels" should work together as "one office". This is also different from Deng Xiaoping who advocated the separation of Party and government. In November 2013, Xi put forward an important document which indicated that he was in favour of market reform: in the future, the market should not just play a basic role, it should actually play a "decisive role". However, it also stipulated that the public sector and the state should control the market. Since then state ownership has been strengthened. The big state-owned enterprises have not been broken into smaller competitive companies as envisaged by the reform proposal; rather a process of consolidation and of merging the big state-owned enterprises has taken place. Some scholars like to talk about the dominance of the private sector in today's China. Yet, the strategic sectors of the economy are still completely dominated by large state-owned companies and through share-owning and other mechanisms they control numerous companies that formally appear as privately owned. China has not turned capitalist under Xi. Capitalist economic forms such as market forces are playing an important role in the economy. However, this is done in an effort to develop productive forces in order to create a more affluent society, which is the precondition for laying the foundation for the socialist transition. This is still the ultimate goal of CCP leadership. It is wishful thinking on the part of Western observers to believe that Chinese leaders are only paying lip service to this goal and actually should be seen as capitalist roaders in disguise. They are part of a hegemonic ideological system which currently is being reinforced rather than weakened. This system relies on the ubiquitous power of the Party. Nothing in the documents and speeches from the Party congress indicates a weakening of the Party's role in the coming five-year congress period. It is also hard to find evidence that Xi Jinping, after having finally consolidated his power, might introduce basic economic and political reforms in an attempt to introduce Western-style democracy. On the contrary, in his speech to the Party congress he stated that "socialism with Chinese characteristics" offers a new and better option for "countries who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence".

Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy an Oscar for her documentary, A Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness in 2016 [Reuters/Mike Blake] Social media in Pakistan is in an uproar. A doctor who provided emergency care to a woman sent an unsolicited friend request to her on Facebook after the hospital visit. Her sister tweeted about it, calling it harassment. The story wouldn't have normally attracted so much attention if the woman tweeting had not been two-time Oscar winner Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy. After she tweeted about the unsolicited Facebook request, the doctor who had treated her sister was suspended. The ensuing backlash against Obaid on social media networks has not subsided for days now. Not that there was ever doubt about the misogynist nature of online trolling in Pakistan, but the attacks on the film-maker have marked a new high in online hate on women. Two things seem particularly unforgivable in Obaid's case: one, that she dared cause a man who did "nothing wrong" to lose his job; two, that she made her fame by "smearing" Pakistan's image. Reading the comments and tweets online, one could feel the exasperation with which men were trying to explain how this friend request could possibly be a consequence of an "informal conversation", a "misunderstanding" or something initiated by the woman; how the man was not given a chance to even breathe and explain himself. I wonder, how many men hearing the story got scared that their own immoral behaviour could be punishable? That their "innocent" comments and actions towards women at work, in the streets, in public transport, in bazaars, etc could indeed be harassment? And in realising that, rushed to their phones and laptops to defend their "right" to do all this without any consequences? Unsurprisingly, Facebook and Youtube got flooded with videos of men condescendingly explaining what exactly constitutes harassment to Obaid and through her, to Pakistani women. Others accused her of harassing the doctor by tweeting about the incident. Obaid was also attacked for being famous; after all, she is viewed as a woman who became successful by "presenting a negative image" of Pakistan. Her Oscar-winning short documentaries tackle the topics of acid attacks and honour killings of women. "The more the pantaloon of Pakistan is taken off, the more popular Sharmeen gets," seems to be the favourite sentence of many social media users commenting on the issue; "taking off pantaloon" (pants) in Urdu means airing someone's dirty laundry. One popular video with tens of thousands of views has a gentleman schooling Obaid on how not to abuse her influence as a celebrity while, of course, belittling her professional achievements: "making 2 to 4 documentaries is not a big deal at all … and it is the doctor who is being harassed." The same man is also indignant about Obaid's use of #Pakistan in her tweets about the incident. {articleGUID} The backlash, of course, encouraged trolling. A Facebook page posted a video called "Sharmeen triggered - how to trigger (harass) Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy", showing visuals of searching for her profile on Facebook and then adding her as a friend. On Twitter one user vowed to keep attacking Obaid and her sister until the suspended doctor is allowed to go back to work and declared that he was going to send friend requests to as many women as he wanted to. Obaid and the question of solidarity Amid the male-dominated trolling spree, there were also some women who chose to join in; many agreed with and even adopted the chauvinistic commentary. "Sharmeen is a tout and a dirty fly. She is only trying to seek fame through these tweets," one female commentator claimed. But there have also been some women and men who have taken this opportunity to talk about what consent means and why the doctor, unethically using medical records to look up Obaid's sister on Facebook, was in the wrong. While there have been some thoughtful debates on sexual discrimination and feminism coming out of this incident, there has also been a degree of scepticism within the progressive circles. Some commentators called Obaid an opportunist and attention-seeker, and recirculated a video in which one of the acid attack survivors from her documentary is accusing her of promising financial reward for her participation and not delivering on it. Some critics also pointed out that as upper-class women, Obaid and her sister are privileged and are easily able to obtain justice for perceived slights. The fact that some people disagree with Obaid's politics and question her work ethics should not mean that they cannot express solidarity with her and her sister. Harassment against women is harassment, whether the victims are rich or poor, ethical in their public work or not. Why should women, victims of gender-based violence or aggression, be questioned about their work ethics? Why should a protest against the violation of one's body come with a "certificate of purity"? Feminist solidarity should be a process and a choice. You should be able to stand with women you do not agree with politically or share a class background with.

China's parliament has made disrespecting the national anthem a criminal offence punishable by up to three years in jail. Members of China's Communist Party-controlled legislature, the National People's Congress, approved the amendment on Saturday that could see offenders face imprisonment of up to three years. Legislators are extending the law to the semi-autonomous regions of Hong Kong and Macau, the latest in a series of crackdowns on dissent and perceived anti-national activities in China . Hong Kong's government, which is dominated by Beijing loyalists, has begun including the national-anthem law in local legislation. Pro-democracy activists fear the law could be used to further undermine freedom of speech in Hong Kong and Macau . The move comes as the anthem, March of the Volunteers, has in recent months become a political flashpoint in Hong Kong, where tensions are rising over Beijing's efforts to assert its authority over the territory.

"Someone asked whether people who are walking have to stop. Yes, just stop." The amended law follows Xi Jinping 's appointment to a second five-year term as party leader, for which he has touted a vision of achieving a "Chinese Dream" of a powerful, prosperous nation. Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise that Beijing would grant the city a high degree of autonomy and an independent judiciary under a "one country, two systems" arrangement. But over two decades of Chinese rule, differences have deepened between leaders in Beijing and a younger generation of democracy advocates, some of whom are now calling for the financial hub to eventually split from China.

APDP maintains that 8,000 people have disappeared in the decades-old conflict [Shuuaib Masoodi/Al Jazeera] Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir - The state-run human rights commission has told the government in Kashmir to investigate at least 2,080 unmarked mass graves discovered in border areas of the restive region. The Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons (APDP), a human rights group in Kashmir, told the commission there were 3,844 unmarked graves - 2,717 in Poonch and 1,127 in Rajouri, twin districts in the region that lie along Line of Control (LoC) that divides the disputed territory between India and Pakistan. In response, the commission acknowledged the presence of 2,080 unmarked graves and asked the government for a comprehensive investigation to be completed in six months, including DNA tests of the bodies to compare it with family members of the disappeared. In 2011, the commission directed the government to investigate the mass graves. At the time, a special team from the commission said 2,730 unidentified bodies were buried in 38 sites across northern Kashmir. "The commission has no hesitation to issue the same directions, which were already issued in the case," the recent order said. Thousands disappeared APDP maintains 8,000 people have disappeared in the decades-old conflict, and accuses government forces of staging gun battles to cover up killings. {articleGUID} The association welcomed the commission's latest demand to investigate mass graves in India's Jammu and Kashmir state. "It is an acknowledgement from the institution that is run by the government. It provides further legal remedies for the family members of missing," Khurram Parvez from APDP told Al Jazeera. "We have been demanding that there be an independent commission to do a credible probe on the mass graves." Parvez said the probe might give an "answer" to families of disappeared who do not know whether their relatives are dead or alive. "We have done a study of 53 cases for a report where the bodies were exhumed from unknown graves. It was found that 49 bodies in the graves were of civilians and one was a local militant, three bodies were unknown. These people were dubbed as foreign militants by the government," Parvez said. Since 2011, instead of complying with directions from the human rights commission, the government continues to avoid such an investigation on the pretext it would lead to a "law and order problem" in Kashmir, APDP said in a statement. The European Parliament adopted a resolution in July 2008 and called on India's government ensure independent and impartial investigations into all mass graves, APDP said. Officials contacted by Al Jazeera declined to comment on Friday. The state government has said most of the missing were likely Kashmiri youths who crossed into Pakistan for weapons training. Those comments have been dismissed by family members of the disappeared. 'Emotional closure' Tahira Begum, 39, from Baramulla whose husband disappeared in 2002, said if the government investigates the graves it would provide "emotional closure" to family members. "We want to know whether our family members are buried in these graves. At least, we will get an address to mourn," she told Al Jazeera. Tahira said she had to leave her three sons in an orphanage after her husband disappeared. {articleGUID} "My kids would run from school and ask me where their father is. For years, I told them he has gone for work outside. But as time passed, I couldn't lie to them any more." Her husband disappeared after leaving home for work and never returned. "I went everywhere to look for him but failed. I just want an answer - what happened to him," she said. Nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan each administer part of Kashmir, but both claim the Himalayan territory in its entirety. Rebel groups have been fighting since 1989 for the Indian-administered portion to become independent or merge with Pakistan. Nearly 70,000 people have been killed in the uprising and the ensuing Indian military crackdown. India maintains about 500,000 soldiers in the territory. Anti-India sentiment runs deep among Kashmir's mostly Muslim population and most support rebels against Indian rule despite a decades-long military crackdown to fight the armed rebellion. India has accused Pakistan of arming and training the rebels, allegations that Pakistan denies. Rebel groups have largely been suppressed by Indian security forces in recent years, and public opposition to Indian rule is now principally expressed through street protests.

Siyakha Traore says his younger brother Bouna, whose death in 2005 led to an uprising, is always in his thoughts [Raymond Bobar/Al Jazeera] This interview took place in May, 2017 Clichy-sous-Bois, France - On October 27, 2005, 15-year-old Bouna Traore, Zyed Benna and Muhittin Altun, both 17, were playing football with a group of friends. It was Ramadan and the time to break fast was approaching in Clichy-sous-Bois, an isolated suburb 15 kilometres from Paris. Police had been called to investigate a possible break-in at a construction site nearby. A little after 5pm, when the boys playing football spotted the police patrol, they ran away, fearing lengthy interrogations. Stop-and-searches are frequent in the "banlieues". They are sometimes carried out more than once a day, often with aggression, and usually target non-white citizens and immigrants, according to several residents Al Jazeera spoke to in the impoverished suburbs. Traore, Benna and Altun, of Mauritanian, Tunisian and Turkish Kurdish origin respectively, and known in the neighbourhood for their good behaviour, ran in the direction of a high-voltage electrical power substation, and hid in the transformer. Bouna Traore, right, and Zyed Benna were 15 and 17 years old respectively when they died in 2005 [EPA] According to accounts and transcripts of police radio exchanges, surrounding officers discussed the fleeing boys. Sebastien Gaillemin was heard saying over the police radio: "If they enter the site, there's not much hope they'll make it alive." The officer was not heard, however, attempting to stop the teenagers from entering. Gaillemin and his colleague Stephanie Klein faced charges of failing to prevent the deaths of Traore and Benna, who were killed by an electrocution so powerful that it plunged the neighbourhood into a blackout. Altun, the only survivor, suffered 10 percent burns. In a country like ours, a democratic country which is the birthplace of human rights, to see the far right rising is unacceptable. Siyakha Traore Ten years after the two boys' deaths, which ignited a three-week uprising leading to a state of emergency, Gaillemin and Klein were acquitted in a final ruling that could not be appealed against. "Bouna is always in our thoughts, we are hostage to our minds," says Siyakha Traore, Bouna's older brother, in an interview with Al Jazeera. "But we are believers and our prayers give us strength. Sometimes when we think a lot, our feelings overcome us. Life carries on, we live with it. We don't have a choice but to accept it." Traore is a well-built and softly spoken man. He picks nervously at the skin around his nails when talking about his brother's final moments. During the interview, Traore also discusses the rise of the far right in France: "In a country like ours, a democratic country which is the birthplace of human rights, to see the far right rising is unacceptable." Bouna Traore's mother, centre, and relatives inaugurate a street sign commemorating the two teenagers in 2015 [Christophe Petit Tesson/EPA/File] He explains why he encourages people to vote: "We are lucky to have civil rights and be able to vote. In some countries you cannot vote. It's important. And if you don't agree with any of the candidates, you have to make a tactical vote or abstain. But in this current context, you can't afford to abstain." And he makes suggestions about how to tackle police brutality: "I don't paint all police with the same brush, and they should not do the same with us. I wanted to launch workshop sessions between the people here and police, so the community learns more about the officers serving them, and vice versa." READ MORE: 'France sees itself as a white country' When asked to reflect on the night his brother's death led to the largest riots France had seen in 40 years, this is what he says: "All of a sudden, there was a power cut in the house. I thought it was a local failure, a blown fuse, but in fact the whole city went dark. I left the house and noticed the neighbours had the same issue. I walked to the shop to get some bread. It was Ramadan and almost time to open the fast. Muhittin Altun ran into the shop. He was in a state of shock. He kept saying, 'Bouna, Zyed, Bouna, Zyed.' I could feel the heat coming from him. He was hot. He was red. His jeans were all messed up, melted against his skin. I went with him in a car to find my brother and Zyed. 'Where is he, where is he?' I kept asking. Muhittin was lost, he was out of it and couldn't direct us. After going around for some time, we came across the power station. 'They're in there,' Muhittin said. He pointed towards a field. Behind a barrier, there was the power station. A fireman climbed up, looked inside the generator where the boys were and said: 'One of them is unconscious'. I was slightly relieved, thinking, 'At least one of them is probably still alive'. As we ran closer to the power station, it became hotter. We took off our watches because they were burning us. I ran over a piece of wood and a stray nail stabbed my foot. I took off my trainers. I was bleeding. We went past the barrier and inside the power station. There was a transformer. 'Where are they?' I asked Muhittin. He cried. 'They are inside the transformer,' he said. We saw the fire brigade coming. The firemen came in to the central area where the boys were hidden. One fireman climbed up, looked inside the generator where the boys were, and said: 'One of them is unconscious.' I was slightly relieved, thinking, 'At least one of them is probably still alive.' Another group of firemen came and cut the metal to free the boys. He managed to open a door, and then hesitated a bit. All the while I still had the shopping in my hand. They took Muhittin to one of the many ambulances that had arrived by that time. The emergency services were blocking people from entering. I told them that my brother was inside. Police asked me for my name, my ID, and my brother's name. They told me to stay away. Everyone in the neighbourhood knew by this point that something had happened, and they were starting to arrive at the scene. It became crowded very quickly. Tensions started to rise. Police officers were telling everyone to go away. By this time, the time to open the fast had already passed. My parents called me and asked me where I was. I noticed our neighbour was standing close by, so I gave him the shopping and instructed him to take it to my parents, and tell them there was an issue with Bouna. My father was sitting on the floor and holding his head. Deep down he knew what had happened, but he still hoped that Bouna was still alive. We were being kept in the dark and the animosity between the youngsters around and police kept growing. Everyone was there - the whole neighbourhood. My parents soon arrived there too, but because of the crowds, I hadn't seen them. I rushed over to them. Word had spread so quickly that our relatives in Mauritania called us up, and asked which of the sons had died. Zyed's parents were there. His father had been in Paris, not Clichy, and friends had gone to pick him up from the city. My father was sitting on the floor and holding his head. Deep down he knew what had happened, but he still hoped that Bouna was still alive. From people abroad to people in jail, everyone was calling us for updates, to find out what had happened. We were still waiting. I couldn't tell you how many hours we spent there waiting. The police called a high-ranking officer to take care of the situation. He came and told us to leave. 'You cannot come in until we ourselves see the bodies,' he said. We told them we were not going anywhere, and so tensions rose once again. Soon after, a woman from the interior ministry came. 'Calm down, you'll be able to see the bodies, but just calm down,' she told us. We were with Claude Dilain, the previous mayor. He was a great guy who brought a lot to the town. Claude asked a senior fireman what had happened. 'With that level of vault, there is no way to survive,' the fireman said. That's when the everyone understood Bouna and Zyed had died. Fights broke out between police and the youth. I heard the messages being sent over the officers' walkie-talkies. 'We need reinforcements!' they kept repeating. My father, me and Zyed's father were still waiting. The medics were treating their disfigured bodies so they wouldn't look too bad when we saw them. Zyed's father went first. He cried: 'That's my son!' and fell to the floor. Then it was my father's turn. I was still holding my trainers in my hands. I remember holding them and looking at the power station entrance until my best friend came to take me away, and told me I should stay at his house that night. The revolt was in full force by then. There was a white policeman behind him and I heard him sniffling. I think he was crying. I told the policeman I wanted to see my brother. 'You have to be strong for your family,' the policeman said to me. Several people held my father's hands and took him back home. My mother was also worried about me. I was in shock and denial. I didn't accept what was happening. I was the last to leave. I was still holding my trainers in my hands. I remember holding them and looking at the power station entrance until my best friend came to take me away, and told me I should stay at his house that night. The revolt was in full force by then. It's possible that a similar uprising will come again. Previous generations had to deal with the skinheads. My father says as a black man that when he arrived in France, he couldn't even walk down the street once without being harassed. We didn't go through what our parents went through, but we will have our own struggles.

Philosophers continue to argue about whether moral judgements can be stated as objective truths [GALLO/GETTY] Can moral judgements be true or false? Or is ethics, at bottom, a purely subjective matter, for individuals to choose, perhaps relative to the culture of the society in which one lives? We might have just found out the answer. Among philosophers, the view that moral judgements state objective truths has been out of fashion since the 1930s, when logical positivists asserted that, because there seems to be no way of verifying the truth of moral judgements, they cannot be anything other than expressions of our feelings or attitudes. So, for example, when we say: "You ought not to hit that child," all we are really doing is expressing our disapproval of your hitting the child, or encouraging you to stop hitting the child. There is no truth to the matter of whether or not it is wrong for you to hit the child. Although this view of ethics has often been challenged, many of the objections have come from religious thinkers who appealed to "God's commands". Such arguments have limited appeal in the largely secular world of Western philosophy. Other defences of objective truth in ethics made no appeal to religion, but could make little headway against the prevailing philosophical mood. Last month, however, saw a major philosophical event: the publication of Derek Parfit's long-awaited book On What Matters . Until now, Parfit, Emeritus Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, had written only one book, Reasons and Persons , which appeared in 1984, to great acclaim. Parfit's entirely secular arguments, and the comprehensive way in which he tackles alternative positions, have, for the first time in decades, put those who reject objectivism in ethics on the defensive. On What Matters is a book of daunting length: two large volumes, totalling more than 1,400 pages, of densely argued text. But the core of the argument comes in the first 400 pages, which is not an insurmountable challenge for the intellectually curious - particularly given that Parfit, in the best tradition of English-language philosophy, always strives for lucidity, never using obscure words where simple ones will do. Each sentence is straightforward, the argument is clear, and Parfit often uses vivid examples to make his points. Thus, the book is an intellectual treat for anyone who wants to understand not so much "what matters" as whether anything really can matter, in an objective sense. Many people assume that rationality is always instrumental: reason can tell us only how to get what we want, but our basic wants and desires are beyond the scope of reasoning. Not so, Parfit argues. Just as we can grasp the truth that 1 + 1 = 2, so we can see that I have a reason to avoid suffering agony at some future time, regardless of whether I now care about, or have desires about, whether I will suffer agony at that time. We can also have reasons (though not always conclusive reasons) to prevent others from suffering agony. Such self-evident normative truths provide the basis for Parfit's defence of objectivity in ethics. One major argument against objectivism in ethics is that people disagree deeply about right and wrong, and this disagreement extends to philosophers who cannot be accused of being ignorant or confused. If great thinkers like Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham disagree about what we ought to do, can there really be an objectively true answer to that question? Parfit's response to this line of argument leads him to make a claim that is perhaps even bolder than his defence of objectivism in ethics. He considers three leading theories about what we ought to do - one deriving from Kant, one from the social-contract tradition of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and the contemporary philosophers John Rawls and TM Scanlon, and one from Bentham's utilitarianism - and argues that the Kantian and social-contract theories must be revised in order to be defensible. Then he argues that these revised theories coincide with a particular form of consequentialism, which is a theory in the same broad family as utilitarianism. If Parfit is right, there is much less disagreement between apparently conflicting moral theories than we all thought. The defenders of each of these theories are, in Parfit's vivid phrase, "climbing the same mountain on different sides". Readers who go to On What Matters seeking an answer to the question posed by its title might be disappointed. Parfit's real interest is in combating subjectivism and nihilism. Unless he can show that objectivism is true, he believes, nothing matters. When Parfit does come to the question of "what matters", his answer might seem surprisingly obvious. He tells us, for example, that what matters most now is that "we rich people give up some of our luxuries, ceasing to overheat the Earth's atmosphere, and taking care of this planet in other ways, so that it continues to support intelligent life". Many of us had already reached that conclusion. What we gain from Parfit's work is the possibility of defending these and other moral claims as objective truths.

The 2008 financial crisis has sparked renewed interest in the writings of Karl Marx, says Zabala [EPA] Barcelona, Spain - Reading and writing about Karl Marx does not necessarily make you a communist, but the fact that a number of distinguished philosophers are reevaluating Marx's ideas certainly means something. After the autumn 2008 global economic crisis, new editions of Marx's texts returned to our bookstores accompanied by a large number of introductions, biographies, and new interpretations of the German master. While this resurrection was undoubtedly caused by the financial meltdown allowed by our democratic governments, Marx's revival among philosophers is not as simple a consequence as many believe. After all, in the early nineties the great French philosopher Jacques Derrida anticipated this return as a response to Francis Fukuyama's (self-proclaimed) "neoliberal victory" at the "end of history". Fault Lines - History of an occupation Against Fukuyama's predictions, the Occupy movement and the Arab Spring demonstrated that history calls once again for a new beginning beyond the economic, neoliberal, and international paradigms we live in. A number of renowned philosophers (Judith Balso, Bruno Bosteels, Susan Buck-Mors, Jodi Dean, Terry Eagleton, Jean-Luc Nancy, Jacques Ranciere, and others), led by Slavoj Zizek, have began to envision how such beginning would look in communist terms, that is, as a radical alternative. This took place not only at successful conferences in London , Paris , Berlin , and New York (which were attended by thousands of academics, students, and activists) but also through such best-selling books as Toni Negri and Michael Hardt's Empire , Alain Badiou's The Communist Hypothesis , and Gianni Vattimo's Ecce Comu . Although not all these philosophers consider themselves communist - at least, not in the same way - the fact that communist thought has been at the centre of their political research permits us to ask why there are so many communist philosophers today. The Marxist revival Clearly, at these conferences and in these books, communism was not proposed as a programme for political parties to repeat previous historical regimes but rather as an existential response to the current neoliberal global condition. The correlation between existence and philosophy is constitutive not only of most philosophical traditions but also of politics in its responsibility for the existential well-being of humans. After all, politics is not supposed to be simply at the service of everyday administrative life but also to provide a reliable guide for everyone to fully exercise existence. But when these and other obligations are not met, philosophers tend to become existentialist, that is, to question and propose alternatives. This was the case at the beginning of the last century when Oswald Spengler, Karl Popper, and other philosophers began to warn us of the dangers that come from a blind rationalisation of all human realms and an unfettered industrialisation of the world. But politics, instead of resisting such human industrialisation, followed its logics with devastating consequences, as we well know. But today, things are not that different if we consider the latest effects of neoliberalism - apart from our current financial crisis, where differentials in material well-being have never been so explicit - slum populations are growing by an shocking 25 million people a year, and the devastation of our planet's natural resources is causing dire ecological consequences throughout the world, and in many cases it is too late to correct. Because of this, a recent UK Ministry of Defence report predicted not only a resurgence of "anti-capitalist ideologies, possibly linked to religious, anarchist or nihilist movements, but also to populism and the revival of Marxism". This revival of Marxism is a direct consequence of capitalism's existential annihilations. What is 'communism'? Although the word "communist" has acquired innumerable different meanings throughout history, in today's public opinion it is not only considered a remnant of the past but also imagined as a political system where all cultural, social, and economical components are controlled by the state. Inside Story - Demanding 'economic justice' Although this might be the case in China, Vietnam, and North Korea, for most philosophers this meaning is not only outdated but also stands in sharp contrast with their existential justifications for its revival. As Zizek put it, if state communism didn't work, it's primarily because of the "failure of anti-statist politics, of the endeavour to break out of the constraints of State, to replace statal forms of organisation with 'direct' non-representative forms of self-organisation." Communism, as the antistatist realm for equal opportunities, today has become the best idea, hypothesis, and guide for nongovernmental or stateless political movements, such as those that arose from the protests in Seattle (1999), Cochabamba (2000), and Barcelona (2011). Although each of these movements fought for different specific causes (against injurious economic globalisation, the privatisation of water supplies, and harmful financial policies) their enemy was the same: democracy's system of property distribution through capitalism's private impositions. As the increasing poverty and slum populations demonstrate, this model has left behind all those who do not succeed within them, generating new communists. Communism and democracy In sum, while Negri and Hardt see in the " common " (ie, where private and public immaterial property can be held in common) and Badiou in insurrectional experiences (as that of the Paris Commune ), the possibility of nonstate "forms of self-organisation", that is, of communism, Vattimo (and I) have suggested looking to the new democratically elected leaders of Venezuela, Bolivia, and other Latin American nations . If these leaders have managed to enact communist policies without violent insurrections, it isn't because of their theoretical or programmatic strength but rather their weakness. Contrary to the "scientific socialism" agenda, weak (or hermeneutic) communism has embraced not only the ecological cause of degrowth but also the decentralisation of the state bureaucratic system in order to permit independent counsels to increase community involvement. It should not come as a surprise if many other philosophers, now made communist by the destructive actions and life-destroying policies of neoliberalism, also see the alternative this region offers, especially because the Latin American nations have demonstrated how communist access to power can also take place through the formal rules of democracy.

Drones cause uproar everywhere they are used, and among the world's ethicists and lawyers [GALLO/GETTY] Scholars have always loved war, whether it's chemists and engineers discovering more efficient ways to kill large numbers of people or social scientists, theologians and philosophers debating when, why and how to fight. Philosophers in particular have long thought about violence; Plato was likely not the first thinker to understand that what goes by the name of "justice" is often merely the violence and thievery practiced by those holding the reins of power. For Plato, their ability to continue to rule depended on imposing upon the weak the very rules they routinely break to maintain their position. Plato argued that a well-functioning society could exist only in so far as philosophers and warriors were its "guardians" (the latter under the former's watchful gaze). To ensure justice prevailed under this system, the guardians would live in poverty and share all their possessions in common, even their children. Sadly - at least for some philosophers - society hasn't progressed in quite the way Plato had hoped. War, drones and justice Most philosophers today accept the argument by the seminal inter-war philosopher Walter Benjamin that violence cannot be understood or judged except "in its relation to law and justice". Arguments about whether a war or the means with which it's fought are "just" in the past century have been increasingly grounded in international law, particularly international humanitarian law and the imperative of protecting civilians who are inevitably caught in the crossfire of conflicts, whether civil or international. People & Power - Attack of the Drones While there are certainly many conservative philosophers who write prolifically in support of their definitions of "just war" (the philosophical underpinnings of President Bush's idea of "preemptive war" is among the most recent examples of this oeuvre ), the profession as a whole can be said to skew towards a more anti-war sentiment. This view is epitomised by a 2003 statement released by members of the American Philosophical Association against the US invasion of Iraq. It argued that launching a preemptive war without the threat of an imminent attack "stretches the meaning of preemption beyond reasonable bounds and sets a dangerous precedent which other states may feel free to follow". Today, the most vehement debates surrounding the use of force by the United States no longer surround the invasion and occupation of Iraq, but rather the use of remotely piloted aerial vehicles - more commonly known as "drones" - by the US, as one of the most important weapons in its ongoing war on terror. The use of drones has caused an uproar not just in countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen and the occupied territories, where they are routinely used to kill suspected militants, but also among ethicists and the international legal community. And now, at least one philosopher, Bradley Jay Strawser, has taken up the challenge of offering a viable justification for the use of drones. A recent hire at the Naval Postgraduate School, his arguments have caused enough of a stir to warrant a profile and opinion piece in the Guardian . Strawser now claims that the Guardian profile in fact misrepresented some of his views; but after reading two of his published papers on the subject, the profile in fact underplays the glaring problems in his arguments. When applied to US policy more broadly, they reveal just how far into a moral and ethical quagmire the United States has sunk under the Bush and Obama administrations. All things equal? Before moving to the Postgraduate School, Strawser worked at the Navy's Centre for the Study of Professional Military Ethics and Oxford University's Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict ( ELAC ). Among the research sponsored by ELAC are projects exploring "Automated, Intelligent Combat and Decision Support Systems for Command and Control" and the more prosaic issues related to determining how law, norms and institutions can prevent armed conflict in a contemporary reality - in which the supposedly "rigid dichotomies" of international law and Just War Theory have become "increasingly difficult to apply". These themes weigh heavily in Strawser's work, in particular in a 2010 article titled "Moral Predators: The Duty to Employ Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles", published in the Journal of Military Ethics , in which he details his argument in support of using drones. The paper makes two primary arguments. First, it claims that "remotely controlled weapons systems are merely an extension of a long historical trajectory of removing a warrior ever farther from his foe for the warrior's better protection. UAVs are only a difference in degree down this path; there is nothing about their remote use that puts them in a different ethical category". Strawser's second argument is that the use of drones is ethical, both because they reduce the risk to the "just war fighters" involved in operating them and, as important, lower the number of innocent civilians killed in strikes compared with other forms of attack. Specifically: "Other things being equal," he writes, "using such technology is, in fact, obligatory," if it can reduce the risk to the person on the "just" side who is controlling the vehicle. In other words, if you can avoid putting a soldier or pilot at risk by using a missile fired from a ship or drone that would have the same effectiveness as one fired from a plane overhead or the ground nearby, you have a moral obligation not to put the soldiers in harm's way. US sends sub drones to Gulf The important caveat for Strawser is that "their employment is done as part of a fully justified war effort meeting" in terms of both abiding "by both jus ad bellum [when one can engage in war] and jus in bello [laws of war] criteria". Here Strawser makes his most important claim, that the use of UAVs is morally justified precisely because they "actually increase the pilot's ability to discriminate" between legitimate targets and, to borrow a phrase from that great theorist of violence, Peter Clemenza , any "pain in the ass innocent bystanders" who might be in the vicinity of the target area. Strawser's entire argument rests on this claim, he admits, because if he can't demonstrate that drones produce lower civilian collateral damage than other weapons, their use becomes much harder to justify - even if they do protect the "just warfighter" back in Virginia. We might imagine, then, that he has provided proof of his claim that in fact the use of drones produces lower casualties than do other weapons systems. What precisely is Strawser's evidence? Shockingly, it consists of a since deleted web brochure by an Israeli drone-maker, Rafael Armament Development Authority, a quote by an Israeli pilot about how the drones help him avoid civilian casualties contained in the document (one might wonder why this didn't set off at least a few alarm bells) and an unpublished conference presentation that uses a "database combining reports from a variety of sources" to argue that drones in fact produce a far lower civilian casualty ratio than other methods of attacking militants. That's it. A publication on one of the most important strategic political issues of the day, which is helping to shape the government's justification of drone strikes - indeed, Strawser admits that he was hired by the Navy Postgradate School in good measure to help advance this argument - actually bases its most fundamental argument on Israeli military industry propaganda and an unpublished conference paper. What's more, Strawser doesn't bother addressing the numerous studies that have shown the opposite, whether it's a Brookings Institution report that "suggests that for every militant killed, ten or so civilians also died", or the New American Foundation study which argues that approximately 32 per cent of casualties are civilians. Nor does Strawser address in his Guardian interview and the follow-up op-ed the recent revelation by the New York Times that the Obama administration uses a formula for counting the number of militants killed that is "deceptive" (in the words of worried government officials) and counts any able-bodied adult male hit in a strike as a combatant. (Al Jazeera's The Listening Post recently did a story on the issue of civilian casualties, available here .) We have to ask, is this really what counts as serious scholarship in the field of military ethics, never mind philosophy more broadly? One would imagine such a discipline would demand even more rigorous empirical evidence to back up any ethical claims, considering the stakes involved. International law sidelined But beyond this, there is the much larger issue of international law and whether the United States can legally kill people outside of recognised battle fields in conflicts that have not been authorised by the United Nations Security Council. Strikingly, the phrase "international law" doesn't appear in Strawser's Military Ethics article, despite the fact that it is inseparable from the larger issues of whether drone strikes are justifiable. Nor does the UN, or the most relevant chapters and articles of its charter. Not surprising, the administration adopts a similar tactic to Strawser's when confronted with challenges about its use of drones, offering "legal conclusions, not legal analysis", when asked to justify their use . Drone designers seek non-violent uses Perhaps most important, the focus of Strawser's work is almost entirely on the "just warfighter". How the drones impact affected populations - what it feels like to live with the terror of the constant buzzing of drones, never knowing when one of its "precision" missiles might hit your house or car just because it contains a few adult men with beards - along with children and the elderly - is, at least in the intellectual context he's operating in, irrelevant. One reason this is so might well owe to the fact that Strawser specifically "reject[s] the moral equality of combatants", one of the cornerstones of Just War Theory, which has long refused to adjudicate the morality or permissibility of an action based on a judgment as to which of the parties to a conflict is "just" or "unjust". Such a determination is impossible once you step out of the moral universe of the individual sides, because each side will naturally claim its cause is just. Yet without offering any justification for such a change in one of the most fundamental components of Just War theory, Strawser declares that "the warrior fighting for a just cause is morally justified to take the life of the enemy combatant, whereas the unjust fighter is not justified, even if they follow the traditional principles of jus in bello such as only targeting combatants and the like, to kill the justified fighter. Thus, there is no chivalrous reason for a just combatant to 'equal the playing field' or 'fight fair'". In another article titled "Walking the Tightrope of Just War", Strawser declares even more directly that "a soldier's side must have just cause for her to be capable of acting justly in war. The presumption of moral symmetry between soldiers is thus abandoned". Strawser arrives at this conclusion by comparing the determination of just causes for engaging in war with whether or not an individual can justly kill someone who attacks him or her without warning. "For each of the kinds of relevant knowledge, the epistemic difference between personal self-defence and war is a matter of degree not kind," he declares in "Moral Predators". He seems unaware that people are not the same things as nations (perhaps they're the same as corporations , but that's a different, though related issue). You might be able to " stand your ground " in 24 states in the US, but considering how much death and destruction countries can unleash on each other, the requirements of following international law are crucial to preventing even greater hostilities when the potential for conflict appears on the horizon. Indeed, Strawser actually seems clueless about this difference in "Walking the Tightrope", where he declares his support for an "evidence-relative" versus "fact-relative" view of "moral wrongdoing and permissibility". In other words, as long as you think you're in the right when you attack - say, you have this evidence from someone named Curveball saying that Iraq has WMD - if it turns out the evidence was wrong after the fact, you don't have to feel too guilty, never mind worry about facing international sanction and even a tribunal at The Hague. It, might, we can assume, be nice to say you're sorry, and promise to be a bit more careful next time. Thankfully, the use of drones - whether based on facts or merely evidence of supposed wrong-doing (or thinking about wrong-doing, or just playing the wrong first-person shooter video game, which the NSA apparently determines is evidence enough that you want to harm the US) is, at least for now, not an option for most people. But soon enough, the same people who refuse to leave their homes unarmed will be travelling around with armed drones hovering over them or their cars, ready to attack anyone who unexpectedly comes to close to or raises its owner's pulse or blood pressure. Think George Zimmerman versus Trayvon Martin in the outer ring of the seventh circle of Hell, and you will have an idea of what life will be like, not in Afghanistan or Yemen, but in Texas or Colorado, once weaponised drones become only slightly more expensive than the remote controlled helicopter your child keeps bothering you to buy. Pakistan expresses concern over drones Justice in 'Beta-world-Zandar' Strawser's arguments may seem ill-conceived when put into the context of a real-world setting, but as you read his work, it becomes clear that he's in fact not operating in the real world at all. Instead, at least in his "drones" article, he's operating out of a place called "Beta-world-Zandar" (that's what he calls it in "Moral Predators") and other "future worlds", who are inhabited by imaginary men named "Tom". Reality gets relegated to the endnotes of his article, where he admits that "there are many in the United States military community itself who do not question the efficacy of UAV usage but rather have principled worries concerning their use such as those mentioned above". I'm not sure where Beta-world-Zandar is, but Strawser clearly believes he's working on a "hot topic" in his professional universe. Indeed, his giddiness seems to have gotten the better of him during the interview for his Guardian profile, in which he explained of the use of drones: "It's all upside. There's no downside. Both ethically and normatively, there's a tremendous value." Those words clearly looked worse on the page than they sounded coming out of his mouth, because in the op-ed he wrote subsequent to the publication of his profile, he declared: "Unfortunately - if understandably, given the complexities of the matter - I consider some of my views were misrepresented. Most disturbingly, I was reported to claim that 'there's no downside' to killing by drones . In fact, the majority of my work on drones is dedicated to elucidating and analysing the serious moral downsides that killing by remote control can pose. The Guardian has graciously offered me this space to set the record straight." Of course, he doesn't deny that he actually said what was written, merely that is was "disturbing" - and rightfully so. But again, rather than "setting the record straight", he merely repeats his claim that drones kill fewer civilians than other options. He goes on to reiterate that "my claim about drones is entirely conditional: they should be used only if the mission is just. As with all conditional claims, if the antecedent is false, then the entire claim is invalidated". But this is of course disingenuous. Neither the media nor the Navy would be paying any attention to Strawser if the drone debate was merely about whether, "other things being equal", it was no worse to kill someone with a drone than with a gun or cruise missile. Instead, the very power of drones - their seemingly godlike omnipresence, omniscience and omnipotence - sows confusion, even among philosophers who should know better. Thus Strawser argues that "the kind of change I'm proposing may already be occurring. Take NATO's present counter-insurgency (COIN) operations in Afghanistan. NATO forces engage the last vestiges of al-Qaeda quite differently from the way in which they engage Taliban fighters. The former they attack 'with prejudice' and, where possible, kill via drone airstrike. The latter they engage more cautiously, avoid high death tolls and use extreme restraint to avoid non-combatant causalities". In fact, hundreds of innocent civilians have been killed in US drone strikes on suspected Taliban members, and this leaves aside the even bigger problem of how a person gets defined as being "Taliban" and whether being a Taliban, whatever that may be, is in and of itself enough to warrant one's being blown to bits on the hunch of a drone operative in Virginia, or in some cases, the White House. US defends drone use for targeted killing What would Kant say? Strawser considers Immanuel Kant among his greatest influences. Thus his homepage contains a well-known quote from the master moralist, who declared that "morality is not properly the doctrine of how we may make ourselves happy, but how we make ourselves worthy of happiness". Kant certainly felt that philosophers should impact important public debates, arguing that if political leaders would heed their - or at least his - advice, a truly peaceful world order could be created. But he also knew well how far humanity remained from the minimum level of civilisation or morality required to achieve what he termed "perpetual peace" ("We are civilised - perhaps too much for our own good - in all sorts of social grace and decorum. But to consider ourselves as having reached morality - for that, much is lacking", he famously wrote in his Idea for a Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Point of View ). For this to happen, individuals and states would need to behave according to the "categorical imperative", which states that one should only "act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law". It's not the Golden Rule (in fact, it’s far more universal because its standard is set at the level of society, not the individual). It's a powerful moral constraint on actions which might negatively impact other people, including the use of new technologies to kill people in far away lands who quite possibly haven't done anything to harm you. The implications of the categorical imperative for US drone policy couldn't be more clear. As ACLU National Security Project Director Hina Shamsi writes , the US must ensure that its use of drone strikes "comports with international law, or it will set a dangerous precedent that could be used tomorrow by nations with less respect for the right to life in particular, and human rights in general". If philosophers are going to join the kill chain and help formulate policies for the use of violence by their countries' militaries, it would be nice if they spent a little less time thinking about how things work on Beta-world-Zandar where "just warfighters" can ply their trade with complete moral confidence, and more time helping to figure out how to transform the fundamental policies of governments on this planet towards supporting a global political economy that encourages peace, democracy and sustainable development. That shouldn't be too much to ask from a tradition that, for 2,500 years, has interrogated the most fundamental questions about human nature and society. Update August 8, 2012: Since publication of this column I have recieved new information about the casualty rates for drone strikes in 2012, data for which was not included in the studies cited above. According to the New America Foundation , the number of drone strikes so far this year is less than half the number for 2011, but there is significant confusion about how many civilians were killed in these strikes. On the one hand, the latest report states that only a handful of civilians have been killed, yet when it breaks down the numbers by individual incident, in every single case it describes the number of non-militants killed in an attack as "unknown", which raises the question of how the authors could come up with a total when they admittedly have no data for the individual strikes. If US government data was used, that raises the issue of how victims are classified as militants or civilians discussed in the article. Moreover, if it is true that drone strikes are improving their civilian kill rate (and I certainly hope it is), this fact could nevertheless lead to an increase in the frequency of strikes, which would ultimately produce more civilian deaths than other methods of attacks which, because they are more indiscriminate, are used more infrequently.

The works of French philosopher Michel Foucault is usually at the forefront of Eurocentric philosophy [AFP] In a lovely little panegyric for the distinguished European philosopher Slavoj Zizek, published recently on Al Jazeera , we read: There are many important and active philosophers today: Judith Butler in the United States, Simon Critchley in England, Victoria Camps in Spain, Jean-Luc Nancy in France, Chantal Mouffe in Belgium, Gianni Vattimo in Italy, Peter Sloterdijk in Germany and in Slovenia, Slavoj Zizek, not to mention others working in Brazil, Australia and China. What immediately strikes the reader when seeing this opening paragraph is the unabashedly European character and disposition of the thing the author calls "philosophy today" - thus laying a claim on both the subject and time that is peculiar and in fact an exclusive property of Europe. Even Judith Butler who is cited as an example from the United States is decidedly a product of European philosophical genealogy, thinking somewhere between Derrida and Foucault, brought to bear on our understanding of gender and sexuality. To be sure, China and Brazil (and Australia, which is also a European extension) are cited as the location of other philosophers worthy of the designation, but none of them evidently merits a specific name to be sitting next to these eminent European philosophers. The question of course is not the globality of philosophical visions that all these prominent European (and by extension certain American) philosophers indeed share and from which people from the deepest corners of Africa to the remotest villages of India, China, Latin America, and the Arab and Muslim world ("deep and far", that is, from a fictive European centre) can indeed learn and better understand their lives. That goes without saying, for without that confidence and self-consciousness these philosophers and the philosophical traditions they represent can scarce lay any universal claim on our epistemic credulities, nor would they be able to put pen to paper or finger to keyboard and write a sentence. Thinkers outside Europe These are indeed not only eminent philosophers, but the philosophy they practice has the globality of certain degrees of self-conscious confidence without which no thinking can presume universality. The question is rather something else: What about other thinkers who operate outside this European philosophical pedigree, whether they practice their thinking in the European languages they have colonially inherited or else in their own mother tongues - in Asia, in Africa, in Latin America, thinkers that have actually earned the dignity of a name, and perhaps even the pedigree of a "public intellectual" not too dissimilar to Hannah Arendt, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Michel Foucault that in this piece on Al Jazeera are offered as predecessors of Zizek? PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY "Why is European philosophy 'philosophy', but African philosophy 'ethnophilosophy' ?" PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY What about thinkers outside the purview of these European philosophers; how are we to name and designate and honour and learn from them with the epithet of "public intellectual" in the age of globalised media? Do the constellation of thinkers from South Asia, exemplified by leading figures like Ashis Nandy, Partha Chatterjee, Gayatri Spivak, Ranajit Guha, Sudipta Kaviraj, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Homi Bhabha, or Akeel Bilgrami, come together to form a nucleus of thinking that is conscious of itself? Would that constellation perhaps merit the word "thinking" in a manner that would qualify one of them - as a South Asian - to the term "philosopher" or "public intellectuals"? Are they "South Asian thinkers" or "thinkers", the way these European thinkers are? Why is it that if Mozart sneezes it is "music" (and I am quite sure the great genius even sneezed melodiously) but the most sophisticated Indian music ragas are the subject of "ethnomusicology"? Is that "ethnos" not also applicable to the philosophical thinking that Indian philosophers practice - so much so that their thinking is more the subject of Western European and North American anthropological fieldwork and investigation? We can turn around and look at Africa. What about thinkers like Henry Odera Oruka, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe, Okot p'Bitek, Taban Lo Liyong, Achille Mbembe, Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze, Souleymane Bachir Diagne, V.Y. Mudimbe: Would they qualify for the term "philosopher" or "public intellectuals" perhaps, or is that also "ethnophilosophy"? Why is European philosophy "philosophy", but African philosophy ethnophilosophy, the way Indian music is ethnomusic - an ethnographic logic that is based on the very same reasoning that if you were to go to the New York Museum of Natural History (popularised in Shawn Levy's Night at the Museum [2006]), you only see animals and non-white peoples and their cultures featured inside glass cages, but no cage is in sight for white people and their cultures - they just get to stroll through the isles and enjoy the power and ability of looking at taxidermic Yaks, cave dwellers, elephants, Eskimos, buffalo, Native Americans, etc, all in a single winding row. The same ethnographic gaze is evident in the encounter with the intellectual disposition of the Arab or Muslim world: Azmi Bishara, Sadeq Jalal Al-Azm, Fawwaz Traboulsi, Abdallah Laroui, Michel Kilo, Abdolkarim Soroush. The list of prominent thinkers and is endless. In Japan, Kojin Karatani, in Cuba, Roberto Fernandez Retamar, or even in the United States people like Cornel West, whose thinking is not entirely in the European continental tradition - what about them? Where do they fit in? Can they think - is what they do also thinking, philosophical, pertinent, perhaps, or is that also suitable for ethnographic examinations? The question of Eurocentricism is now entirely blase. Of course Europeans are Eurocentric and see the world from their vantage point, and why should they not? They are the inheritors of multiple (now defunct) empires and they still carry within them the phantom hubris of those empires and they think their particular philosophy is "philosophy" and their particular thinking is "thinking", and everything else is - as the great European philosopher Immanuel Levinas was wont of saying - "dancing". The question is rather the manner in which non-European thinking can reach self-consciousness and evident universality, not at the cost of whatever European philosophers may think of themselves for the world at large, but for the purpose of offering alternative (complementary or contradictory) visions of reality more rooted in the lived experiences of people in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America - counties and climes once under the spell of the thing that calls itself "the West" but happily no more. The trajectory of contemporary thinking around the globe is not spontaneously conditioned in our own immediate time and disparate locations, but has a much deeper and wider spectrum that goes back to earlier generations of thinkers ranging from José Marti to Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, to Aime Cesaire, W.E.B. DuBois, Liang Qichao, Frantz Fanon, Rabindranath Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi, etc. So the question remains why not the dignity of "philosophy" and whence the anthropological curiosity of "ethnophilosophy"? Let's seek the answer from Europe itself - but from the subaltern of Europe. 'The Intellectuals as a Cosmopolitan Stratum' In his Prison Notebooks , Antonio Gramsci has a short discussion about Kant's famous phrase in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785) that is quite critical in our understanding of what it takes for a philosopher to become universally self-conscious, to think of himself as the measure and yardstick of globality. Gramsci's stipulation is critical here - and here is how he begins: Kant's maxim "act in such a way that your conduct can become a norm for all men in similar conditions" is less simple and obvious than it appears at first sight. What is meant by 'similar conditions'? To be sure, and as Quintin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith (the editors and translators of the English translation of Gramsci's Prison Notebooks ) note, Gramsci here in fact misquotes Kant, and that "similar conditions" does not appear in the original text, where the German philosopher says: "I am never to act otherwise than so that I could also will that my maxim should become a universal law." This principle, called "the categorical imperative", is in fact the very foundation of Kantian ethics. So where Kant says "universal law", Gramsci says, "a norm for all men", and then he adds an additional "similar conditions", which is not in the German original. "The world at large, and the Arab and Muslim world in particular, is going through world historic changes - these changes have produced thinkers, poets, artists, and public intellectuals at the centre of their moral and politcial imagination . " PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY That misquoting is quite critical here. Gramsci's conclusion is that the reason Kant can say what he says and offer his own behaviour as measure of universal ethics is that "Kant's maxim presupposes a single culture, a single religion, a 'world-wide' conformism... Kant's maxim is connected with his time, with the cosmopolitan enlightenment and the critical conception of the author. In brief, it is linked to the philosophy of the intellectuals as a cosmopolitan stratum". What in effect Gramsci discovers, as a southern Italian suffering in the dungeons of European fascism, is what in Brooklyn we call chutzpah , to think yourself the centre of universe, a self-assuredness that gives the philosopher that certain panache and authority to think in absolutists and grand narrative terms. Therefore the agent is the bearer of the "similar conditions" and indeed their creator. That is, he "must" act according to a "model" which he would like to see diffused among all mankind, according to a type of civilisation for whose coming he is working-or for whose preservation he is "resisting" the forces that threaten its disintegration. It is precisely that self-confidence, that self-consciousness, that audacity to think yourself the agent of history that enables a thinker to think his particular thinking is "Thinking" in universal terms, and his philosophy "Philosophy" and his city square "The Public Space", and thus he a globally recognised Public Intellectual. There is thus a direct and unmitigated structural link between an empire, or an imperial frame of reference, and the presumed universality of a thinker thinking in the bosoms of that empire. As all other people, Europeans are perfectly entitled to their own self-centrism. The imperial hubris that once enabled that Eurocentricism and still produces the infomercials of the sort we read in Al Jazeera for Zizek are the phantom memories of the time that "the West" had assured confidence and a sense of its own universalism and globality, or as Gramsci put it, "to a type of civilisation for whose coming he is working". But that globality is no more - people from every clime and continent are up and about claiming their own cosmopolitan worldliness and with it their innate ability to think beyond the confinements of that Eurocentricism, which to be sure is still entitled to its phantom pleasures of thinking itself the centre of the universe. The Gramscian superimposed "similar conditions" are now emerging in multiple cites of the liberated humanity. The world at large, and the Arab and Muslim world in particular, is going through world historic changes - these changes have produced thinkers, poets, artists, and public intellectuals at the centre of their moral and politcial imagination - all thinking and acting in terms at once domestic to their immediate geography and yet global in its consequences. Compared to those liberating tsunamis now turning the world upside down, cliche-ridden assumption about Europe and its increasingly provincialised philosophical pedigree is a tempest in the cup. Reduced to its own fair share of the humanity at large, and like all other continents and climes, Europe has much to teach the world, but now on a far more leveled and democratic playing field, where its philosophy is European philosophy not "Philosophy", its music European music not "Music", and no infomercial would be necessary to sell its public intellectuals as "Public Intellectuals".

Chao's exclusive report was a follow-up of a documentary on Duterte's presidential campaign [Al Jazeera] Al Jazeera English has won two prizes at the Association for International Broadcasting (AIB) Awards in London. Steve Chao's 101 East documentary, Duterte: A President's Report Card , won the Best Politics and Business category award, while Tarek Bazley's web special, Voyage to Antarctica , jointly produced with Digital Producer Alaa Batayneh, won the award for the Best Interactive category. {articleGUID} The documentary looked into the Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's first few months in office as he carried out his war on drugs and corruption. Duterte sat down for an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera's Chao to talk about his controversial domestic policy, as well as Manila's warming relations with China. The Philippine president defended his anti-drug war policy, which at the time of the interview had left more than 3,500 people dead. He also admitted that children and innocent people had been killed in the bloody crackdown, calling them "collateral damage". The documentary was a follow-up on an earlier special report on the improbable presidential campaign of Duterte, then mayor of the southern Philippine city of Davao. So honoured to have won an #AIB award for our coverage of the Philippine President.

RenderPagesVideo('5611223764001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Caracas, Venezuela - After months of violent protests, the streets of the Venezuelan capital have quieted down in recent weeks. Now, both the government and the opposition are focusing their energy on Sunday's regional elections, hoping to show their strength in the ballots. "We have to vote," opposition leader Henrique Capriles told supporters. "The way out of our problems is that on Sunday we go out to vote en masse." But it won't be easy. Many opposition supporters are disappointed, having previously believed that their protests would have led to some type of change. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5610332656001, 0, 0, 330, 186, "bcvid_5610332656001"); brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: Venezuelan opposition raises concern of vote rigging (2:30) "Honestly, I don't know what to think about what will happen," Manuel, a singer in Caracas, told Al Jazeera. "I thought that the government would give in to some of our demands - if not presidential elections, something else. But every time they have a new trick under the sleeve." One of the tricks that Manuel refers to was the July vote for a Constitutional Assembly , a legislative super body tasked with drafting a new constitution which also has power over other branches of government. For President Nicolas Maduro , this is a way to deepen the revolution of ex-president Hugo Chavez and turn Venezuela into a true socialist state. But for the opposition, this is a way of taking power away from the opposition-controlled National Assembly and the termination of the separation of powers in the country. Venezuelan opposition leader Henrique Capriles (C) speaks to reporters on Friday [Federico Parra/ AFP/Getty Images] World watching Sunday's vote is long overdue - it should have taken place in December 2016. For the opposition, these elections are a chance to win some governorships and test the ground in advance of presidential elections scheduled for next year. The government is aware that the world will be watching. "There is international pressure and for the government this is a way of trying to save face and saying that this is not a dictatorship, that there are elections," Margarita Lopez Maya, a professor at the University of Central Caracas, told Al Jazeera. " "They have destroyed the institutions in this country." Polling stations relocated On Friday night, Capriles headed to dozens of voting centres in Miranda state after reports that many of them had been relocated. "This was a centre that until last night had voting machines," said Capriles during one of his stops. "The military was protecting it and now, out of the blue, they shut it down and moved it somewhere else ... Nobody notified the ones voting this Sunday." OPINION: Maduro is not Chavez Capriles believes this is part of a government strategy to discourage people in a state that has traditionally voted for the opposition from heading to the polls. The government rejects the accusation and has told international observers that everything is on track for Sunday's vote. "Relocating voting centres is completely constitutional - nobody is breaking the law," Adan Chavez, brother of the late president, told Al Jazeera. "It was announced by the electoral council. What was decided is that in the places where there were some incidents in the past they decided to move them and that is legal." Key vote Even though many of the traditional observers have not been accredited, the opposition believes that their witnesses at the voting centres will play a crucial role in ensuring the election results are credible. But there is also another issue. Maduro has said that the governors elected on Sunday will have to be "sworn in and subordinate themselves" to the Constitutional Assembly or face dismissal. Capriles and his supporters say that those attributions belong to the opposition-controlled Congress, even though the government has stopped acknowledging it a long time ago. "The opposition likes to talk as if they are democrats, but they forget that they were part of a coup in the past, and if they could they would get rid of a constitutionally elected president. They never acknowledged Maduro," a member of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela told Al Jazeera. The truth is that nobody here seems willing to negotiate. In spite of the irregularities, the government insists the election will be free and fair. The opposition will be hoping for some big gains, and if there are any doubts over the way the vote is run demonstrators will likely take to the streets again.

Opponents of a proposed peace deal between the Colombian government and the FARC campaign for a ''No'' vote a day before a referendum was held on October 2, 2016 [Ariana Cubillos/The Associated Press] The people of Colombia were given a choice on October 2, 2016, to approve a peace deal designed to bring the world's longest continuous war to an end through a referendum. The accord was narrowly rejected with 50.2 percent of voters opposing the deal. The armed conflict between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) spanned more than 50 years. The war resulted in the deaths of more than 220,000 Colombians and displaced nearly seven million people. Despite a desire for peace, many felt that the agreement made in Havana, Cuba, was too lenient towards the FARC. Under the proposed accord, its members who confessed to their crimes would be entitled to reduced sentences. On November 24, 2016, President Juan Manuel Santos pushed through a revised peace agreement. Since then, a fragile peace has been maintained, with the FARC fighters laying down their weapons and some of them starting families . Still, there are concerns about the implementation of the peace deal, the viability of the FARC as a political party with guaranteed seats in congress and the threat coming from right-wing paramilitary groups. A new mother and former FARC fighter, an ex-FARC commander, a peace worker and a senator reflect on the events of the last year and consider the challenges of creating a lasting peace. Yorly Ramirez, 26, former FARC fighter and medic At age 13, I said I'd join the FARC and change the situation that thousands of Colombians were facing. Now, I'm 26 years old, and I'm a new mother to a boy called Enders. I was pregnant before, but it was too difficult. It wasn't safe to have children during the war. We had no place to raise them in the camps.

I wasn't going to have a baby for it to be raised by someone else. That's when I decided to have an abortion. Four months after the peace treaty was signed, they sent me to Bogota to be part of a group of journalists and tell the story of the post-conflict time. We're part of a new era, all of us guerrilla fighters. FARC did many things that were inconvenient. We have asked for forgiveness and will do so until the very last moment. It hurts us because we also lost family members. It hurts us bad. There's no going back now. There's a risk of dying because Colombia is still not prepared to accept us as regular citizens. A paramilitary could still kill me because he doesn't agree [with the deal]. I firmly believe in the peace process, and I will continue with it . I will keep on working for the party. I don't think it would be right for me to walk away from something I've spent so much time fighting for. To go home and not lift a finger, I mean, it's good that I'm with [my family] but where would all those years of fighting go? Luis Emil Sanabria, Director of REDEPAZ (National Network of Civic Initiatives for Peace and Against War) Hearing the [referendum's] result was a very difficult moment. There was nothing more we could do. Our surveys said that the majority of the population were in favour [of the 'Yes' vote]. We never had any expectation that it would be rejected. Since 1993, we have been working for peace, for reconciliation. We did a campaign to support the peace agreement. This agreement followed one of the most significant discussions between the government and the FARC guerrillas ever. I think the public was manipulated. Luis Emil Sanabria Of course, there was a counter-campaign in favour of the 'No' vote, which was fundamentally based on false truths, but which won. I think the public was manipulated. But, at the same time, the peace deal had gained significant support, almost 50 percent of the population, so we decided to keep working. I think little by little, the Colombian people are understanding the magnitude of the agreement and the importance of implementing it. A year after the plebiscite there is still not social justice in Colombia . Colombian society needs to know the truth so that we can reconcile ourselves with everything that's happened during this armed conflict. But we are working to reconcile ourselves, particularly in the regions that have been closest to the conflict and are most affected by it. There's also a concern about what will happen after the next elections [to be held in March 2018]. The Centro Democratico opposes the peace agreements, they don't want the FARC in congress, and they feel the victims have not received reparations, so if they get into power, the peace agreement could be at risk. They [FARC] will face challenges adjusting to traditional democracy because they are not an organisation that follows that path. They have a democracy which is still gripped by corruption in regions where drug trafficking takes place. Eventually, I think we will see that the peace agreement will benefit everyone, in economic terms and in social terms . There are various sections of Colombian society that are excluded from the benefits of development and economic growth. Peace will aid Colombia's economic development. Colombia is still one of the most under-developed countries in the world, with everything concentrated in the cities. But there is still the question of reparations, of drug trafficking of politics and recognising the FARC as a political party. This is a difficult moment for Colombia. Alfredo Rangel Suarez, 62, Senator, Centro Democratico political party It was a very intense, animated campaign leading up to the referendum. Centro Democratico supported the 'No' campaign, but the 'Yes' campaign was supported by the government, the media, business owners and by many parts of the international community. The campaign was very unequal. We've had a year of implementing agreements that were rejected by the Colombian people Alfredo Rangel Suarez However, the public voted 'No'. Unfortunately, this decision was ignored by the government, so we've had a year of implementing agreements that were rejected by the Colombian people. The problem with the Havana agreement is that it gave impunity to a terrorist group. The FARC have carried out tens of thousands of crimes against humanity; assassinations, massacres, kidnapping, disappearances, systematic rape. The Centro Democratico doesn't object to FARC having a political party after it has turned in all weapons and has fully demobilised, but what we do object to is that those members of the FARC who are responsible for crimes against humanity don't spend time in jail and can become politicians and occupy seats in congress and enjoy a situation of complete impunity. President Santos said the FARC had agreed to hand over 14,000 weapons, but they've only handed back 8,000. This presents a risk to national security in Colombia. They are the only political party in Colombia with an armed wing and an illicit trade that provides them with huge economic resources. [FARC] say they need to protect themselves from paramilitary groups but paramilitaries don't exist in Colombia. They were demobilised, and their leaders are in prison. Many became drug traffickers once they were demobilised and they do business with the FARC and ELN guerrillas now - they're partners. The peace agreements were designed to reconcile a country, but they can't do this when they're out of step with the majority of public opinion. The agreements being enforced in Colombia now were rejected by the public because the Colombian people see that they are agreements for impunity, that there hasn't been justice and that the promises haven't been fulfilled. Robinson Ramirez Franco, 49, former FARC commander When the plebiscite happened, I was in Bolivar Square in Bogota. No one knew who I was, but I was going crazy thinking 'how is it that after so many years of war people can say no to peace?' We thought we were going to win; I couldn't believe it. I thought 'What's happening? These people are ignorant; they want the war to continue.' I left the FARC eight years ago. I had to travel for four days and three nights through the mountains without food. I had been with them for 13 years. After so much death I had to leave. I was tired of war. Robinson Ramirez Franco When the bombardments started many of my friends died. One of the commanders who died knew me since I was 17, he'd been with me the whole time, since my beginnings with the FARC. After so much death I had to leave. I was tired of war. I started a foundation called NUVIPADES, which stands for Nueva Vida por los Desmovilizados (New life for the demobilised) to support demobilised guerrilla fighters and to keep ourselves strong and heard, if not by FARC, then by the government. We were not represented at Havana; deserters couldn't speak, there were no pardons for us, we are traitors to the cause. There was a girl whose parents were FARC guerrillas. The mother died a short time after she was born and so her grandparents took care of her. Her father was killed when he deserted to return to his daughter. Now she's 14 years old, and her family is trying to get her recognised as a victim of the conflict, but nothing has happened so far. We've helped about 180 ex-guerrillas. We help them and their families find employment, or to set up businesses, but we also try to build up their self-esteem and teach them respect and responsibility. My hopes for the future? I don't have many. While capitalism reigns people will always take up arms. Peace can exist but not within the current system. I'm tired of wars; I don't want to fight. I've always wanted peace and to build a new Colombia. We have to fight for a lasting peace so that that can be the story of the nation.

RenderPagesVideo('5617092223001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); After months of deadly protests, a regional election won by the ruling party, and objection by the opposition, Venezuela has entered a new political stage. President Nicolas Maduro's PSUV party picked up 18 of the 23 governorships that were up for grabs in last Sunday's regional elections. The win by the ruling socialists came as a shock to the opposition, which was projected to win based on early polling. The opposition accused the government of election fraud - an allegation Nicolas Maduro denies. Opposition leaders also blamed the way the election was conducted, including the relocation of 200 voting centres days before the polls opened. Calling for an audit of the results, opposition leaders boycotted the swearing-in ceremony for the elected governors on Wednesday, saying they would not attend a session before the new National Assembly, a body they consider unconstitutional. Instead, they said they wanted to be sworn in by their legislative councils. "They will only pledge before God and their respective legislative councils," opposition leaders said in a statement last Thursday. The government has agreed to the audit for transparency's sake, but Maduro maintained the election results were the will of the people. The October 15 elections were a product of the "conscience that the people have", the president said during a televised press conference last week. He added that the government won despite what he called "imperial forces" launching a "psychological, political and economic war" against his government. Maduro has repeatedly warned that "whoever is not sworn and subordinated to the National Constituent Assembly will not be able to assume its role". In a public address on Friday, Maduro added that "somehow they have to learn ... they only recognise the results when they win". The five newly-elected governors of the opposition agreed to begin a consultation process with all sectors of society to decide whether or not to be sworn in before the National Constituent Assembly. But the regional elections and the opposition coalition's (MUD) response to the results have revealed deep divisions within their ranks. 'Ambivalent discourse' The day after the results were announced, several candidates and leaders of the opposition broke with the established narrative, with some conceding defeat despite the official coalition line that the elections were fraudulent . According to local media, Henri Falcon, the current state governor of Lara, who lost against the Chavista deputy, Carmen Melendez, said that "one goes to an election to win or lose ... we lost, it's that that simple, and [now] we have to accept it". Alejandro Feo La Cruz, who was the governor of Carabobo, also acknowledged his defeat against Rafael Lacava. The outgoing governor of the Amazonas region, Liborio Guarulla, who is part of the opposition, blamed MUD's decision to not run a candidate from the Amazonas for the opposition's loss. "For 17 years, the Amazonas [region] walked with its indigenous people, and democracy, but the MUD in Caracas ended with this, by imposing a candidate representing its own interests," Guarualla said on Twitter. 17 años Amazonas caminó en proyecto de ls pueblos indígenas y la Democracia MUD Caracas acabó con ella imponiendo candidato x sus intereses — Liborio Guarulla (@LiborioGuarulla) October 17, 2017 Prior to the election, Vente Venezuela, an opposition movement led by Maria Corina Machado, detached itself from the coalition and abstained from participating in the elections, citing what Machado called an illegitimate process. Machado, instead, called for more protests. Opposition leader Enrique Ochoa Antich blamed Machado and other leaders for the opposition's defeat. "Thanks Maria Corina and Aristiguieta: Because of this abstentionist preaching, we lost Miranda, Carabobo and Lara," Antich said on Twitter. "A huge favour you did to the government." Gracias, Ma.Corina y Aristiguieta: A causa de su prédica abstencionista, perdimos Miranda, Carabobo y Lara. Favor q le hicieron al gobierno! — Enrique Ochoa Antich (@eochoa_antich) October 18, 2017 Javier Buenrostro, a professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico , emphasised that such deep divisions within the opposition were a major reason for its defeat last Sunday. "The opposition has had an ambivalent discourse," Buenrostro told Al Jazeera. "For me, that is the main reason that explains the defeat of the right, they fought an institutional battle, and called for votes, while at the same time they called for insurrections in the streets," he explained. Some within the opposition agreed. Chuo Torrealba, t he former executive secretary of MUD, was quoted in local media as saying there was no one within the opposition ranks capable of leading the country. "A campaign was made by politicians for politicians, the same ones who called [for protests in the] street, began to call for votes ... and they forgot other issues," Torrealba said after the regional election results were announced. For others, the opposition's loss on October 15 represents deeper problems within the coalition that some analysts and supporters say its leaders have yet to acknowledge. "The ruling party has been bathed in democracy ... and the only ones who do not realise the crisis they are living, are the representatives of the opposition," Saverio Vivas, a politician who sympathises with the opposition, told Al Jazeera. "People are disregarded by the incoherent behaviour they've shown," Vivas added. Leonardo Bruzail, an opposition supporter, also said that Venezuelans have "lost the trust in opposition leaders". "What we are facing is a disaster, we are experiencing an institutional, political, economic, social crisis. I don't know how we will recover from this," Bruzail told Al Jazeera. 'These were close elections' Highlighting the overall percentages of votes in the regional elections, Buenrostro also noted that there is still a valid political space for the opposition . "There isn't a major difference in votes, these were close elections, but the territorial control and the hard vote gave the government the triumph," he said. Of the more than 11 million people who voted, 52 percent supported government candidates, while 45 percent supported the opposition, according to the National Electoral Council. "Venezuela is not the dictatorship that many want to sell, it is a democracy with authoritarian tendencies, but there is space for opposition," Buenrostro said. "Ultimately, people decided not to vote for violence ... and violence was identified with a faction of the opposition." Venezuela is not the dictatorship that many want to sell, it is a democracy with authoritarian tendencies, but there is space for opposition. Professor Buenrostro, analyst Uncertainty for Venezuela As uncertainty over the direction of the opposition coalition mounts, and with new threats of new sanctions from various international players, some worry the economy, which is already suffering from high inflation and food and medicine shortages, will only continue to be aggravated . "The government has improved its position and weakened the opposition ... however, they have sacrificed the nation ... and the money spent on political campaigns will intensify the situation," Ronal Rodriguez, a researcher at the Venezuelan Observatory at the University of Rosario in Colombia, told Al Jazeera. Venezuela's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to contract by six percent next year, after shrinking an estimated 12 percent in 2017, according to IMF estimations. Expressing concerns over allegations of election "irregularities", some members of the European Union said it was examining "appropriate measures" to help resolve the political crisis in the country. The United States is also considering a possible measure against Venezuela's oil imports, which is one of the main sources of income for the country. The Lima group, formed by Argentina , Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia , Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama , Paraguay and Peru, will hold a meeting on Thursday in Canada with the intention of accentuating the pressure on Maduro's regime. For Rodriguez, t he possibility of new sanctions, combined with last Sunday's result, means the government will have to respond to not only further economic deterioration but also new pressures within and outside the country. "They [Maduro's government] will have to respond to the challenges that imply an economic deterioration, and a social deterioration that has led to the departure of millions of Venezuelans," Rodriguez said. "An immediate reaction of [last Sunday's] results have been more people leaving the country especially to countries like Colombia."

Guanipa refused to acknowledge the National Assembly and be sworn in as governor of the state of Zulia [Reuters] Venezuela's opposition is facing a "deep political crisis", analysts say, as fractures within the coalition have emerged following the surprise loss in this month's regional elections. Four out of five opposition governors in Venezuela accepted their elected posts last week in defiance of the opposition Democratic Unity Coalition (MUD). The four opposition politicians broke with the official MUD line when they chose to acknowledge the National Constituent Assembly, which is aligned with President Maduro's party, and be sworn in as governors. MUD, which was expected to win a majority in the October 5 elections, refused to accept the result of the polls, calling the elections fraudulent - an allegation the government denies. Additionally, MUD has maintained that the National Constituent Assembly is "illegitimate" and called on its winning candidates to refuse to be sworn in by the body. Maduro's ruling PUSV party took 18 of the 23 seats up for grabs. The only opposition candidate to maintain MUD's official stance was Juan Pablo Guanipa, the governor-elect of the oil-rich Zulia state. On Thursday, the National Assembly approved a decree to hold a new election in the state. Guanipa stressed that his decision to not be sworn in by the National Assembly "was not easy, but being faced with a dictatorship forces us to act with conviction, strength and consistency ". At the same time, he said he was aware that this decision would bring dire consequences. "I am emotionally, rationally, and spiritually prepared … for any consequence as a result of the actions we are taking," he said. The decision by the other winning candidates to accept the National Assembly has exposed deepening divisions within the opposition, which analysts argue has given momentum to Nicolas Maduro and his party. {articleGUID} "These results have generated a deep political crisis within the opposition," Ramon Pinango, a sociologist and analyst, said. "The government can seize these hours of confusion to advance their political power," he told Al Jazeera. The National Assembly on Thursday called for local mayoral elections in December. The government was expected to call the elections for next year, but some, including Pinango, argue Maduro is taking advantage of the opposition's fractures, believing it will have the success it had in the regional elections. A political confrontation MUD has refused to acknowledge the National Assembly, which overrode the opposition-run national congress in July. By being sworn in by the National Assembly and accepting the results of the October 5 elections, the governors of the states of Tachira, Merida, Nueva Esparta and Anzoategui broke with the opposition's official line, and experts say this showed a fracture within the coalition. "The Chavismo not only managed to win critical elections, they also managed to put the opposition in crisis by leading them to an electoral confrontation," Marco Terugi, an author and political analyst, explained. Many MUD supporters viewed the governors' actions as a "sellout". Popular opposition leader, Henrique Capriles, broke away from the coalition after the four governors, who are all part of the Democratic Action party (AD), were sworn in. Capriles said he would not be a part of MUD as long as Henry Ramos Allup, leader of AD, one of the biggest parties within the MUD, was a member. Sin duda vamos hacia una NUEVA UNIDAD!En las peores crisis y circunstancias siempre surgen oportunidades!Por encima siempre Venezuela! — Henrique Capriles R. (@hcapriles) October 23, 2017 Translation: "We are going to see a new unity. In the worst crises and circumstances, opportunities always crop up." Andres Velasquez, an opposition candidate who lost in Bolivar state also condemned the four leaders who were sworn in before the assembly. 1/ 3.- Gobernadores que se arrastraron ante ilegitima e inconstitucional ANC, merecen el mayor repudio nacional. — Andres Velasquez (@AndresVelasqz) October 23, 2017 Translation: "The governors who crawled and went to the illegitimate and unconstitutional ANC, deserve greater national repudiation." The AD's Allup lamented the reactions, saying "many see this as a golden opportunity to shoot against Democratic Action". He added: "It pains me that instead of facing together the crisis the country is in, we shoot at each other." Capriles accused Allup of being Maduro's chosen "opposition candidate" for the 2018 presidential election. "He is obviously the candidate Nicolas Maduro wants, Maduro finally found his official opposition candidate," Capriles said. The opposition leader's comments came after Maduro said in a press conference that he would "wait for" Allup in 2018. Two models But many believe that the struggle within the opposition goes much deeper. {articleGUID} Rachid Yasbek, an opposition member and coordinator of First Justice party in Bolivar state, told Al Jazeera that there are two competing models within the coalition. "We have a model that defends the old way of doing politics, and is seeks to accommodate ... and the other that is willing to give everything for the country," he added, referring to opposition leaders who called for near-daily street protests earlier this year. Yasbek and his First Justice party believe protests are the real way to bring about change. "Our duty with the country is to fight for our democracy, that is why our party (First Justice), and leaders like Capriles, and Juan Pablo [Guanipa] fighting for this change," Yasbek said. But some analysts believe the coalition is breaking away from the protest model and moving toward one that is more willing to speak to the government. Javier Buenrostro, a professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, told Al Jazeera that the opposition is already seeing a transition away from those who supported the protests to Allup, who many believe is willing to talk to the government. "What we are seeing now is the fracture of the right, and a transition to Henry Ramos [Allup] within the coalition," Buenrostro said. He added that Allup "will have the opportunity to lead the opposition". But he said he is not sure the opposition leader can win in 2018. Buenrostro added, however, that "i t will make him [Allup] more competitive, and maybe give him the chance to work within the framework of a 'pacted' democracy". Deep economic crisis While the political crisis escalates, the country is also gripped by a rising economic crisis. The Lima Group, formed by Argentina , Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia , Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama , Paraguay and Peru, held a meeting on Thursday in Canada to discuss Venezuela's crisis. In a statement, the group said: "child malnutrition stands at 11.4 percent, equivalent to a state of crisis according to world standards, primary school dropout rate has increased by 45 percent, and the cost of the basic food basket has increased by 343 percent in the last year". {articleGUID} As many as 85 out of every 100 medicines are not available , and diseases that were believed to have been eradicated, such as malaria, have increased by 76 percent. While the opposition blames Maduro and his economic policies for the humanitarian crisis, the government's supporters say the opposition parties do not offer any alternatives. "I don't think the opposition parties are offering a real alternative to bring change," Zumira Cardozo, a government support, told Al Jazeera. "We reached to this point, due to the economic war they have imposed against the government", she added. Many also believe the opposition is paying a high price for a failed strategy. "To be incoherent has been the opposition's biggest failure, to say something today, and do something else tomorrow, this has weakened its political reach," sociologist Pinango explained. "Now they are forced to change, and come up with a better strategy," he said. SOURCE: Al Jazeera News ABOUT THE AUTHOR Elizabeth Melimopoulos Politics Venezuela Latin America
An image of the late revolutionary hero Ernesto 'Che' Guevara is seen in a gate of a public building in Havana, Cuba [Ivan Alvarado/Reuters] Fifty years ago, on October 9, 1967, Ernesto "Che" Guevara - Argentine-born doctor and Cuban revolutionary hero - was executed in Bolivia as part of a US-orchestrated plot to rid the world of his pernicious anti-imperialist influence. Given that Guevara is as popular and symbolic as ever half a century later, it seems that the US government can safely file that project under the category "Oops". Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5539874898001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5539874898001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: Castro and Guevara face to face (2:36) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Of course, the Americans have long denied responsibility for the killing - a claim neatly dismantled by American lawyers Michael Ratner and Michael Steven Smith in their book "Who Killed Che? How the CIA Got Away with Murder". Cuban-American CIA agent Felix Rodriguez, present at Guevara's demise in the Bolivian hamlet of La Higuera, has helped promote the US line that the fatal decision was all the Bolivians' doing. Rodriguez has, furthermore, vociferously objected to the romanticisation of a man he says was nothing more than "an assassin" who "enjoyed killing people" - a pretty rich allegation coming from someone who also volunteered to assassinate Fidel Castro and who, Ratner and Smith note, has referred to the Dominican Republic's former blood-drenched dictator Rafael Trujillo as a "so-called tyrant". The 'most complete human being' Writing in the Washington Post in 1997, documentary filmmaker Saul Landau described Guevara as a "tough disciplinarian who impassively dispatched traitors [but] also refused to let enemy wounded go untreated" - a man who built hospitals and schoolrooms, whose "love for the unknown masses" drove him to entirely sacrifice his own physical comfort in pursuit of a more just society. French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre praised the guerrilla leader as "not only an intellectual, but also the most complete human being of our age". READ MORE: Che Guevara and Fidel Castro - Revolutionary Friends Yet the "assassin" card continues to be played by plenty of folks, many of them with dodgy right-wing track records. When some years ago it was discovered that US-based Urban Outfitters had decided to appropriate Che's image for a T-shirt and other merchandise - since we all know US clothing corporations fervently support anti-capitalist revolution - the company CEO was harangued by a dubious human rights group for "lionising a murderer" with a "bloody ideology". Never mind that Urban Outfitters and far too many other such entities have also been known to mass-market products emblazoned with the American flag - a symbol of a system that sort of takes the cake in terms of ideological bloodiness. Che wasn't superhuman, but he was more than himself - which is perhaps why they've never really been able to kill him. At the time of Guevara's murder, for example, the US was engaged in a spectacularly bloody affair known as the Vietnam War, in which up to several million people were ultimately eliminated. As if that weren't enough, The New Yorker reported last year that "[s]ince the end of the war, in 1975, more than forty thousand Vietnamese have been killed by U.X.O. [unexploded ordnance]". It's worth emphasising, too, that Guevara's abhorrence of Yankee imperialism didn't materialise out of nowhere. He personally witnessed the 1954 CIA coup in Guatemala against the democratically elected president, Jacobo Arbenz, who had stepped on the toes of the US banana company, United Fruit, and other enemies of Guatemalan democracy. In the ensuing decades-long civil war - in which the US , as usual played, no minor role - some 200,000 people were massacred. Guevara went on to confront US power at various international nodes. In Cuba , he helped overthrow former US dictatorial buddy Fulgencio Batista and with him the prevailing arrangement of gleefully corrupt oppression. READ MORE: Cuba's changes - what would Che say? In Congo, as John Gerassi wrote in the Los Angeles Times, Guevara endeavoured to "help the remnants of the nationalist movement of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, who had been murdered with the connivance of Belgian and CIA agents". In Bolivia, alas, the empire caught up with him. Gone was the man who had once declared, "with the risk of appearing ridiculous, that the true revolutionary is guided by strong feelings of love". The real danger In the decades since Che's death, the US has proceeded with business as usual, wreaking havoc across the globe on behalf of elite capital. That the country is sorely lacking in the human emotions department should be clear from the health of the arms industry and the physical and economic punishment regularly inflicted upon human bodies from Afghanistan to Mexico . Some helpful sound bites from the US political establishment shed additional ideological light - such as the response of Madeleine Albright, former US ambassador to the United Nations and secretary of state, to a question about reports that half a million children had died thanks to US sanctions on Iraq : "We think the price is worth it". To be sure, some "strong feelings of love" would come in particularly handy right about now - if only to assure ourselves that reality doesn't have to be what US President Donald Trump says it is. In a final letter Guevara wrote to his children, to be given to them in the event he was killed, he advised: "Remember that the Revolution is what is important and that each one of us, on our own, is worthless." And while his executioners certainly weren't under the impression that Guevara on his own was "worthless", the real danger he posed to the capitalist order, in fact, lay in his example of interhuman solidarity. In the end, Che wasn't superhuman, but he was more than himself - which is perhaps why they've never really been able to kill him.

The move of the National Indigenous Congress is a move towards the decolonisation of politics, of political life, write Mignolo and Vazquez [Reuters] The First Nations of Mexico have launched a political campaign that has surprised many and that has been widely misunderstood. In the face of the horror of 215,000 deaths in the last 10 years and after 500 years of oppression, the First Nations, articulated in the National Indigenous Congress (CNI), have launched a political initiative constituting an Indigenous Council of Government (CIG), whose speaker, Maria de Jesus Patricio Martinez, will be registered as a candidate for the national presidential election. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5464129174001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5464129174001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: Mexico's first indigenous woman presidential candidate talks to Al Jazeera (2:36) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Critiques of the established political spectrum were loud: from patronising, misogynic and racist attacks to Patricio Martinez, to calls for the inclusion of the CNI proposal into the ongoing political processes of political parties. All criticism evinced that Western political perspectives are bankrupt. Why the misinterpretation and criticism? Mainly for two reasons: First, the fact that the new initiative has been taken after 23 years of disqualification and rejection of both the electoral procedures and the national system of government by the EZLN (Zapatistas). The EZLN have indeed its own forms of governance, known as Juntas de Buen Gobierno (Boards of Good Government) . How is it then, that now the EZLN, which form part of the CNI, decides to participate in the new initiative? Second, the assumption that María de Jesus Patricio Martinez, the CIG speaker, will be just like any other individual candidate in the competition among political parties, in spite of the fact that both the CNI and the Zapatistas refuse to participate in any political party. READ MORE: Mexico violence peaks with over 2,200 murders in June What is in the project of the CNI that is so difficult to understand and respect? While most of us have been indicted to celebrate western modernity, market democracy, meritocracy, and the 'good life' of consumption and development; we now have another option: the decolonial option that open up the door to 'indigeneity at large'. The reason lies in the arrogant ignorance that distinguishes the western notions of institutional politics. First Nations' concept of the political is derived neither from Greece nor from its modern European-centered version from Machiavelli through Locke to Marx. The CNI participation in the national presidential election appropriates the tools of the modern/colonial state to advance their own project. While the initiative is indigenous, it is not only for the "Indigenous" population but also for all of us who share the seven ethico-political principles of their political platform. Obedecer y no mandar (To obey and not to command) Representar y no suplantar (To represent and not to supplant) Servir y no servirse (To serve, not to serve yourself ) Convencer y no vencer (To convince and not to win) Bajar y no subir (To go down and not to go up) Proponer y no imponer (To propose and not to impose) Construir y no destruir (To construct and not to destroy) A political project based on these principles may sound romantic to some. While most of us have been indicted to celebrate Western modernity, market democracy, meritocracy, and the "good life" of consumption and development; we now have another option: the decolonial option that open up the door to "indigeneity at large". The National Indigenous Congress agenda is no return to the past. On the contrary, it manifests and enacts the need to decolonise politics. The First Nations intervention in political life has a history that has been largely ignored. READ MORE: Zapatistas break silence to slam Mexico elite At this junction, we find the first sign of discomfort for the political establishment: the difficulty to recognise and accept that the uni-national state and the monocultural democracy is untenable. The second sign of discomfort is the political philosophy of the Zapatistas and Congreso Nacional Indigena. "To govern by obeying" is a powerful philosophical maxim that subsisted under the erasure of coloniality. "To rule by obeying" defies the pyramidal structure of Western political governance where those who govern do not obey, in spite of the fact that public officers are called "public servants". The third sign of distress is to imagine being governed by an indigenous woman, María de Jesus Patricio Martinez. It is indeed unimaginable that a society ruled by a uni-national monocultural and patriarchal state supporting and supported by the capitalist economy would accept her project. Maria de Jesus Patricio Martinez is not primarily a candidate, but the speaker (vocera) of the Indigenous Council of Government, formed by more than 200 councillors, designated in communal assemblies across the country. The CIG required a prior consultation that included 523 communities in 25 states of the country belonging to 43 indigenous peoples. The council is made up of 73 members, 42 men, and 31 women, who were also proposed by their assemblies and accepted in the CNI plenary. The legitimacy of this council is undeniable and shows communal governance at work. No political party has this legitimacy. The strategy of the National Indigenous Congress is resignifying the notion of the political. They are enacting a politics that is not interested in taking power. They are not interested in the electoral process as a competition ground for parties to see who gets power and wins the privilege of ruling over others. In our view, the move of the National Indigenous Congress is a move towards the decolonisation of politics, of political life. READ MORE: Disease, discrimination and dignity Yes, they are partaking in the national electoral process, but they are utilising an anti-systemic strategy capable of revealing its fundamental flaws. The electoral process is turned into a tool for delinking from Western/liberal presuppositions, of delinking from representative democracy. They are relinking with what has been preserved through 500 years of colonialism: 300 years of imperial rules and 200 years of internal colonialism after the independence and the formation of the Mexican nation-state. The delinking is not simply an act of resistance, but it also implies the enactment of a radically different political life. We see this initiative as a call to "indigenise politics". Indigenising does not mean essentialising, on the contrary, indigenising means to delink from the abstraction of representative politics, from the abstraction of the individualised consumer/voter. Indigenising the political means taking responsibility, enacting a politics of positionality and engaging in the well-being of the community or communities to which we belong, in the city as in the countryside. The CNI is handing an invitation to reclaim the freedom that has been taken from us by the apparatus of representation of the State. Can we indigenise ourselves, can we relinquish the desire and weakness of being governed? Can we exit the apathy of representational life and regain the freedom to be and act with others? The decolonisation of politics does not mean to gather people around one political project, a national monocultural project. To decolonise the political means to celebrate difference: "to be able to host the difference of the other" (Esteva 1996). María de Jesus Patricio Martinez is embodying the hope of the decolonial option, the hope of the re-emergence of all those that have been silenced, denigrated, been made dispensable under the project of modernisation, of progress and development. She carries the testimony and the hope that the ancestral voices will be able to flourish in a politics of "indigenisation", of taking responsibility towards the earth and towards our communal others. State politics has long ignored the Indigenous and the wretched. The CNI will not be competing in the market of representation. It is the moment of those whose lives have been made dispensable by the system to enter political life, to exercise the freedom of the political beyond the state. We know that the emergence of the voices from the assemblies, from every organised community reclaiming the freedom of acting and doing with others, will bear a torch of hope in the face of the silencing wall of the modern colonial structures of racism, patriarchy and capitalism. The process launched by the CNI is actively "walking" the myriad geographies of the disavowed Mexico . The CNI is activating conversations, not political speeches. "Walking" means togetherness in the making of the communal. It is engaged in the reconstruction of the communal that the state (from the left and from the right) want to ignore and annihilate. The CNI voceras and voceros are engaged in the enormous task of weaving the communal through the country, with the smallest, the most vulnerable and the most resilient. The construction of alternative worlds of meaning is already taking place, much before and beyond the election. The CNI, including indigenous and nonindigenous people following their lead, is enacting a politics of listening to all those that have been marginalised and silenced by the modern/colonial order. This campaign will not be entering the cacophony of modernising utopias, of development promises, but rather focusing on healing the colonial wound. This campaign will not be one that is searching to convince the self-interested client-voters, it will be one of enabling coalition building, of learning from each-other and doing with each other. This campaign will not be one of managing natural resources but of caring for the earth. In the face of the politics of representation, the CNI is enacting a politics of relationality.

In this February 3, 2012 photo, people dance at a funk 'baile' in Cantagalo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil [AP] This year, samba, Brazil's most iconic and widely acclaimed musical style, is celebrating its 100th birthday. About 100 years ago, it was persecuted and criminalised as the music of former slaves and their sons. In early 20th century, playing samba was synonymous with being a criminal, a "malandro". Many "sambistas" were persecuted and arrested during the Vargas dictatorship in the 1930s and 1940s. Yet its rhythm was so captivating that despite the persecution, a stylised version of samba was played at parties of the "elite" which weren't threatened by police raids. Over time, people forgot where this music came from and it became one of the most well-known and cherished symbols of Brazil . Today, another popular music style, Brazilian funk, is facing the risk of being criminalised in the same way. Just like samba, funk was born in the favelas. Although some songs praise crime and drug trafficking, especially those in the funk style known as "proibidao" ( "strongly prohibited" in a literal translation), funk deals with a wide range of themes, from love to the struggles associated with the day-to-day life in the favelas and the desire to be rich and powerful. In many ways, it is similar to American hip-hop. People who believe funk is dangerous for the Brazilian society have recently taken action to officially "ban" this popular music style. Members of a popular Facebook group called "Funk is garbage" collected more than 20,000 signatures and presented a bill to the Senate that would, if accepted, criminalise funk music. Former football star and senator from the state of Rio de Janeiro, Romario Faria, was chosen as the rapporteur for the proposal. A public discussion on the issue, hosted by the Commission on Human Rights and Participatory Legislation (CDH) of the Senate, took place on September 13 . From the start the scope of the proposed ban was ambiguous. Nobody knew what opponents of this music style wanted to ban - funk parties, concerts or the sale of related material. The proposition only stated that the signatories are hoping to alert the Brazilian government to "the public health threat" funk music is allegedly posing to children, teenagers and families. Senator Romario Faria concluded on September 14 that the criminalisation of the musical genre is not legally defensible "because of the right of free expression of thought, guaranteed by the Federal Constitution". The other senators of the commission agreed with Romario and, unanimously, rejected the proposal to banish and criminalise funk on September 21. {articleGUID} Most people presumed the senate would never accept the proposal anyway, but they still spoke strongly against it, as they viewed this proposal as yet another racist attempt to criminalise the culture and lifestyle of those living in the favelas. Danilo Cymrot, a doctor in criminology at the University of Sao Paulo (USP) explained in an interview with the BBC that he does not view the attempts to criminalise funk music as "arbitrary". "We previously witnessed other attempts to criminalise blacks, poor people and favela residents," he said. "Sambistas were associated with vagrancy, they were called vagabonds." Anitta, considered to be the queen of Brazilian funk, said on her Twitter account that the supporters of the ban on Funk are "22 thousand uninformed people who need to leave the comfort of their homes to know a little more of our country". The controversy surrounding funk music did not come to an end with the rejection of the proposal. Those opposing funk music still say that the style promotes the disintegration of the family and encourages drug trafficking. They argue that at "bailes funk" or street parties where funk music is played, drug consumption and irresponsible sexual encounters are prevalent. They say that minors freely attend these parties and get involved in criminal and immoral behaviour. These parties do exist and some participants in them most certainly consume drugs. But this is also true for many other parties, raves and nightclubs. Drug consumption does not define funk music, which is one of the most diverse styles in the Brazilian music scene today. Funk is indeed sensual. Many funk songs have lyrics that describe erotic encounters and funk enthusiasts participate in erotically charged dance moves. But, of course, the same can be said of several other musical styles, including samba, which many now consider to be Brazil's national music style. As journalist Thiago Cardim, writing for Judao, one of the leading arts and culture websites in Brazil, explained, funk is not that different from other musical styles known and loved all over the world. Just like American rap or Mexican narcocorrido, Brazilian funk also has a mainstream version and more controversial sub-genres. It is worth remembering that rock music also faced prejudice and organised banning attempts in the past. Its fans were considered Satanists, outcasts or drug addicts. Many music genres faced prejudice in their early years, but we need to understand that the campaign against funk in Brazil is something more sinister than a harmless conservative reaction to a new music style. It is yet another manifestation of racism against poor, black Brazilians living in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. The racist attempts to ban and criminalise this music style and the Brazilians that enjoy it will most certainly continue in the future. But Brazilian funk, just like samba, is here to stay.

The fact that Mexican people do not trust their politicians is hardly surprising, writes Salomon [Sergio Ortiz/Itzel Plascencia Lopez/Gabriel Ortiz Guerrero] At 1:25pm on 19 September 2017, a powerful 7.1 magnitude earthquake tested the stamina and strength of millions of Mexicans - and of the country's authorities - to their core. Dozens of buildings collapsed, leaving nearly 300 dead, scores injured and thousands homeless or too scared to go back to their apartments. Mexico had turned into something out of an apocalyptic film. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5587672197001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5587672197001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: Mexico: As quake search continues, thousands left homeless (1:48) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY When a tragedy such as this takes place, collective adrenaline kicks in. In a country that knows better than wait for authorities to take charge, the initial panic quickly turns into an overwhelming sense of collective unity and strength. One I had never seen before. As I walked back home to the Roma neighbourhood (one of the most affected areas in the city) from my office - still shaken by what had happened, trying to check if my friends were ok and wondering if my building was still standing - I saw the city that I had come to call home transform before my eyes. What I saw was not only utter destruction and desperation but hundreds of thousands of people springing into action in an almost unexplainable unity. Builders, office workers, students and shops clerks ran to the collapsed buildings to sift through the rubble in a desperate search for survivors. They did it with the tools that poured in as donations, or with their bare hands. Human chains of people passing buckets of rubble would become a common sight across the city. READ MORE: Earthquake kills more than 220 in central Mexico In other parts, people began cooking; others set up collection centres for donations. Improvised volunteer-run shelters sprang up like flowers; cyclists became food distributors, taxis were free. President Enrique Pena Nieto had an opportunity to show its people that he and his government care. He badly missed it. Three days after an earthquake changed our lives, anybody walking through the destroyed and cordoned-off streets of Mexico City's most affected neighbourhoods would have been hard-pressed not to encounter several collection centres per block, strangers offering each other food and fresh water, scores of men and women armed with helmets and shovels everywhere. What were once some of the fanciest parks in town had become tent cities. The formerly chaotic donation centre, where I had spent many hours on the day the earthquake hit Mexico, had turned into an impressively organised operation. Each area clearly marked according to the type of donation - water, meals, food supplies, blankets, tents, medicines, toys. Lines of volunteers loading cars, bikes and trucks with whatever they were told was needed in other parts of the city and across the country. Other volunteers shouting out instructions and carefully writing down the donations coming in and out. Most of them, including myself, had never done this before. Most had never been in a humanitarian disaster - let alone seen their city collapse around them - they were too young to remember the 1985 earthquake which left at least 10,000 dead and a city on its knees , ironically exactly 32 years to the day from this new disaster. I looked around the various centres I had helped in and thought to myself that, perhaps, this is what democracy and community are all about. People scribbled the words "help" or solidarity messages on every single bottle of water or bag of food that had been donated because they did not want the government to steal things or take credit for donations, writes Salomon [Sergio Ortiz/Itzel Plascencia Lopez/Gabriel Ortiz Guerrero] This week, Mexico surprised me. Its people inspired me to my very core. Their stories and their compassion are an example to the world. There was the old woman who had travelled from a town 60 kilometres away from Mexico City to make sandwiches for the rescuers because she could not "sit by the TV and watch all the destruction happening again without her doing anything about it". The 12-year-old boy who joined his dad loading boxes that were clearly too heavy for him onto a truck destined for remote communities, away from any attention. The architect who had, in the space of an hour, become an expert in organising bottles of water. The therapist who had come up with a way to help heroic rescue dogs relax as they battled through seemingly endless days and cold nights under the relentless Mexican rain. The rescue workers, the doctors and nurses, the drivers, the victims forgetting about their own suffering and joining efforts to help others. But there was one scene that particularly stayed with me - a disturbing one. READ MORE: Mexico earthquake - Victims complain of slow response In every donation centre, groups of people gathered around tables or on the floor, frantically scribbling down with big indelible ink markers on every single bottle of water or bag of food that had been donated the words "help" or solidarity messages. "We do this so the government doesn't steal things. So that they don't take credit or political advantage," people told me time and again. The fact that Mexican people do not trust their politicians is hardly surprising. That a government would use this tragedy for political advantage is, put simply, repugnant. Mexico's deep problems - corruption, massive inequality, soaring crime, shocking levels of disappearances and violence against women and the systematic lack of justice, to name but a few - will not end when the rescue efforts finish or when people can finally find a new place to call home. President Enrique Pena Nieto had an opportunity to show its people that he and his government care. He badly missed it.

People accused the authorities of deploying professional rescue workers too late, relying on volunteers to run shelters, failing to distribute donations , preventing ordinary citizens from reaching those living in remote areas. Investigations are being demanded to review the deeply corrupt real estate business, which is being blamed for allowing the construction of unstable structures in a city prone to earthquakes . Today marks a week since the earthquake that changed, once again, Mexico's face. Today is also the third anniversary of the still unresolved enforced disappearance of 43 students in the state of Guerrero. It is going to take a lot more than grandiose speeches to break the deep mistrust people here have with those in power. Pena Nieto should, at least, try taking a leaf out of Mexican citizens' book.

RenderPagesVideo('5633006466001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); WHAT IS THE DAY OF THE DEAD? A hybrid of Spanish Catholic and pre-Columbian traditions, Mexicans gather in cemeteries to remember departed loved ones at the end of October and in early November. It's believed the heavens open on November 1-2 and the souls of the dead come back to earth. During the celebration, families decorate graves with "ofrendas" (altars) and the cempasuchil (Marigold) flower. Juchitan, Mexico - The only room left standing in Mariano Lopez's home after last month's deadly earthquake in southern Mexico was a small bedroom. Lopez and his wife, Isabel Jimenez, have since had to move in with relatives, but over the last few weeks, have visited their Juchitan home to turn the remaining corner into a "biguie'" or an altar for Jimenez's mother, Guillermina, who died in March. "The earthquake took our house, but it didn't take away the happiness we get from receiving visits from our dead, and from this tradition that lives in our hearts," Lopez told Al Jazeera. Juchitan is known for its Day of the Dead celebrations. In any other year, the streets of the city centre are crammed with vendors selling the yellow cempasuchil (Marigold) flowers and fruits that are used in the rituals. This year, the celebrations are much more modest. In the indigenous Zapotec language, which is spoken by most in the city, the traditions surrounding Day of the Dead are called Xandu, a Zapotec adaptation of the Spanish "Todos Santos" ("All Saints Day"). But Juchitan was hit hard by the 8.2-magnitude earthquake that shook southern Mexico on September 7, meaning the celebrations have taken on a new meaning. 'Juchitan has completely changed' At least 37 people were killed in the massive tremor, and one out of three homes were left uninhabitable in the city of 75,000. {articleGUID} "Juchitan has completely changed, the dynamic of community life and social life has been cut off," Gaspar Cabrera Manuel, a Catholic missionary who works in Juchitan, told Al Jazeera. "People are focused on rebuilding their own houses and their own lives, and they've had to put other things aside," he said. Thousands still live under tarps, with relatives or in government shelters. Demolition of damaged houses has only just started, and reconstruction is still a long way off. The September 7 earthquake destroyed thousands of structures across southern Mexico [Edgard Garrido/Reuters] The federal government has begun handing out payments of 120,000 pesos (around $6,300) to people who lost their houses, but that amount of money is small compared with the value of the destroyed homes. Oscar de Lima, a resident of Juchitan who organised the Xhie Nee Brigade to perform rescue and reconstruction work after the earthquake, told Al Jazeera that the quake has created a "psychological wound" in the people of Juchitan. "Some of these houses had generations of hard work and investment put into them," he said. "And now, people are realising that they've lost everything." The biguie' But even in such a difficult situation, the people of Juchitan are keeping alive their pre-Colombian and syncretic Catholic traditions surrounding the Day of the Dead. Almost every house in Juchitan was damaged by the quake, and the air is still filled with dust from demolitions. But people can be seen carrying bales of cempasuchil flowers back to their houses - or the lots where their houses once were - to build biguie's. {articleGUID} The biguie', the centre of the Xandu rituals, is a shrine that people build in their homes to welcome the dead, who, according to Zapotec tradition, visit their loved ones' homes on October 30 and 31. Biguie' are elaborate structures, consisting of hanging wooden boards decorated with cempasuchil flowers and arrangements of photographs and fruits or snacks preferred by the deceased relative. Building a biguie' implies a significant investment of time and money that many in Juchitan are struggling to make this year, so many offerings are much smaller than normal. But creating an offering for the dead, even a modest one, is still a priority for many. "The dead come only once a year, so you have to welcome them," said Cabrera Manuel, the Catholic missionary. "Even if it's just a small altar, a seat on the patio. There's a very strong, intense emotional connection, and it can't be broken, not even by an earthquake." Mariano Lopez and Isabel Jimenez built a biguie' for Jimenez's mother who passed away this year [Simon Schatzberg/Al Jazeera] For Lopez and Jimenez, this year's biguie' is especially important, partly because many people in Juchitan will not be able to participate in the tradition. They hope Jimenez' mother's biguie' will offer refuge to spirits of the dead whose families are prevented from building offerings. "This year we are celebrating my mother Guillermina, but it's not just about her, because she can share it with the others," Jimenez said. "The people who died on the streets, the people with no family, the people with nowhere to go to receive the smell of fruits and flowers, it's also for them, they're also welcome here." The biguie' is an important tradition that Zapotec people are working to keep alive, but for Lopez, Xandu represents something deeper than any specific material ritual. "When I feel the strong October breeze, carrying the smell of the cempasuchil and incense, it's already Todo Santo for me," he said. "When the winds blow against our bodies, our ears, our hair and our faces, that's the spirits caressing us, reminding us that we are not alone, and bringing us nostalgia and happiness." And like for many others, the Xandu traditions bring Lopez and Jimenez comfort in a situation of extreme adversity. "It helps us rebuild our souls, our way of thinking and our way of life."

RenderPagesVideo('5629142038001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Ciudad Juarez, Mexico - At first sight, he looks like an average 14-year-old boy. Sturdily built, initially taciturn and with a fashionable top knot haircut, Jose* listens head bowed as his dad says that he brings him nothing but trouble. Tongue lashing over, he eventually comes to life, wanting to show off his pigs and hens, all happily rooting around outside the ramshackle house that he shares with his family on the outskirts of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico . But outside of this picture of relative domestic tranquility, Jose is involved in another dangerous world. He works for a local cartel, guiding undocumented immigrants from Ciudad Juarez across the desert, and into Texas and New Mexico. The cartel uses him as a people smuggler because, as a minor, he'll most likely get a ride back to Mexico if caught by the US border patrol. From there he can make the trip again, and again. Jose is not the only one. Organised crime leaders are using numbers of children and adolescents to cross migrants all along the Mexico-US border, researchers tell Al Jazeera. Jose says the journey takes him only about 30 minutes. "You feel adrenaline, and then you're already there [...] then we let them hide in a hotel and someone picks them up," he tells Al Jazeera. He started when he was 12 years old. He says he doesn't know exactly how many times he's braved the snakes and biting cold of the desert, but the one thing that he does know is that the money is good. Jose receives $200 for every Mexican he crosses and $500 for anyone else (typically that means Central Americans, escaping the rampant gang violence in their own countries). He takes two to four people with him at a time, moving at night, trying to escape the attention of the US border patrol. While his journey means he can make up to $2,000 on a good day, thousands of other Juarez residents, who work the late shift in the city's maquila factories producing goods for exportation to the US, earn around $5 a day. That means that even in an average night's work, Jose can make what a factory worker would in four months. "With the money I can do many things," Jose says in a quiet, shy voice. "Buy clothes, food. I can do many things for my family," he adds. 'Who knows if I'll even make it to 18' His father, however, isn't impressed by the work or the money. {articleGUID} Juan* is a construction worker who takes pride in his hard earned salary. "I taught him to work, not to be roaming the streets," Juan says. He has already had one son killed by gangsters - knifed in the back returning from work. With tears in his eyes, he says that the night before men came to the house looking for Jose. "I told them to go away, come back tomorrow," he tells Al Jazeera. "They could shoot him to avoid paying him, and just leave him there lying on the ground," he says. "I've seen so many things living here at the border. That's why I'm fearful." Researchers say they have seen a trend in cartels using minors in the people smuggling trade [Al Jazeera] Cartels often fight over drug and people smuggling routes with considerable collateral damage. Ciudad Juarez, in particular, has seen years of such conflicts. At the end of the last decade, the city was dubbed the "murder capital of the world". When asked what he plans to do when he reaches 18 - the age when he is no longer a minor and is in danger of prosecution by US authorities - Jose takes a long pause before he says: "Who knows if I'll even make it to 18." A booming industry For as long as there has been obstacles and surveillance between Mexico and the US, there have been people smugglers for hire. {articleGUID} In Mexico they are known as "polleros". Children have been part of the business for at least 20 years, according to the few experts who study this trend. But little is known about their involvement because of Mexican child privacy laws, and because both the US and Mexican government count them together with all unaccompanied minors. What experts and officials in Mexico and the US do agree on is that the cartel involvement has meant a significant increase in the number of children involved. They are operating, not just in Ciudad Juarez, but at several points along the border - crossing migrants from Tijuana to neighbouring San Diego, California, Nogales to Arizona and Matamoros to Brownsville, Texas, according to academics and officials on both sides of the border. Researchers documented 935 cases of children involved in human and drug smuggling activities between 2011 and 2016. [Al Jazeera] Jose Romero has lived in El Paso - just across from Ciudad Juarez - almost all his life. As a US Border Patrol agent, he has witnessed the developing phenomenon first hand. "We definitely saw the shift in which they [the cartels] started using more juveniles than adults, whereas in the past there were typically more adults," Romero tells Al Jazeera as he stands in the blazing mid-day El Paso sun close to the wire mesh border fence. Romero says the number of juvenile people smugglers they have identified has doubled in the last 10 years. "It used to be a mom and pop operation, and people would pay between $350 and $500 to get smuggled into the US," Romero says. But when the US first erected a fence along the border in 2006, a shift began. With increasingly limited options to cross, Romero says the border patrol noticed small scale people smuggling operations were forced to use the same routes as the drug smuggling cartels. "The cartels noticed that also, and realised their own routes were being compromised," Romero says. "So they took control of the human smuggling routes." Once they had taken over the business, the cartels came to the same realisation as the smaller operators before them: young people smugglers kept coming back, even when they were caught. The US authorities it seemed, couldn't touch them. The 'pollerito' boom As the number of juvenile people smugglers increased, they got their own name: "polleritos". It's the diminutive of "polleros" (chicken handlers) - what Mexicans have long called adult people smugglers. The migrants themselves are the "pollos" (chickens). {articleGUID} Polleritos are usually between 12 to 17 years old. Gabriella Sanchez, an immigration expert, has studied them extensively, along with other border-hopping children. While she was a professor at the University of Texas at El Paso, she and her research team documented 935 cases of children involved in human and drug smuggling activities between 2011 and 2016. Sanchez and her team found that children are employed in a spectrum of jobs in an illicit border economy. Minors roles range from drug smugglers ("burreros" or "mules"), to look-outs watching the border patrol's movements ("halcones" or "falcons"); there's also "liebres" (hares), who act as bait to distract border patrol agents while smugglers slip across; and "reclutadores" (recruiters), who recruit and train other children to join the workforce. But it is not just organised crime bosses who bring minors into this economy, Sanchez says. "Most of them are recruited by their siblings, aunts and uncles, and even their own parents," she says. It reflects the fact that for some families on the border, running migrants to the other side is just another job in which they and their children earn what they need to survive. Their job as people smugglers has becomes more important than school for many. Sanchez says most polleritos drop out by the time they reach 6th grade (11 years old). That rises to virtually 100 percent by the time they've been detained by the border patrol for the first time, she adds. Getting them back Gilberto Solis has made it his mission to try and get those children back into classes. The softly spoken 40-year-old psychologist is the head of the government shelter "Mexico mi Hogar" (Mexico my Home). The centre receives deported children in Ciudad Juarez, where they are fed and sleep until their parents come to pick them up. {articleGUID} Mexico mi Hogar looks a bit like a prison from the outside, with its barbed wire, high walls and security corridor. Staff explain that some deportees, who get impatient as they wait for their parents to show up, make a run for the wide-open spaces. But the small team of psychologists and social workers see it less as a holding pen and more as a launching pad for getting young border hoppers away from the criminal world. On the day Al Jazeera visited, a maths class was taking place. Five or so teenagers with pained expressions attempted to get through sums while a young, bearded teacher in a t-shirt willed them onwards. Down the corridor, a crafts session was about to kick off, with paper-mache ovals sitting ready on tables for their next coat. The students are deportees that Mexico mi Hogar has kept track of. They invite them back to the centre for classes in a bid to get them up to the level in which they can return to school. {articleGUID} The team also organises summer camps to involve the children in sports, arts, cultural activities. The hope is that by showing them a wider world, they will realise they have alternatives to gang life. The staff knows it is running against a stiff deadline: the moment when pollerito turns 18 years old and ceases to be a minor. "We have to get to them at that point, when they can't cross any more," Solis tells Al Jazeera. "Because that's when they get deeper into organised crime, dealing drugs or violence." Anapra - The people smuggling hotspot The Mexico mi Hogar team's campaign is focused in particular on one neighbourhood: Anapra. It's pollerito central in Ciudad Juarez. That is mainly because of where it lies. Anapra is located on the outskirts of the city, where the metal wall which covers 30 percent of the border abruptly ends. Social worker Fernando Roacho, a Beatles fanatic with a corresponding haircut and Ismael Lozano, a more senior psychologist who talks about the children they help with a parent's pride head to Anapra to visit Tomas*, a minor who has passed through the Mexico mi Hogar programme. The border town of Anapra has become pollerito central [Al Jazeera] For many, it is not hard to see the attraction of the money that being a pollerito brings in Anapra. Children walk to school along dirt roads. Water, drainage, even electricity are patchy. Lozano stops the car where the border fence ends and gives way to the desert. Rows of rudimentary wooden houses with corrugated iron roofs back almost directly onto the US border. Lozano says they bring their new social worker recruits to this spot. "They need to know exactly what's the everyday reality of the kids we work with, first hand," he explains. The pair hopes to persuade Tomas to come to the centre the catch-up classes. Tomas is tall, with a pierced eyebrow, clad in a basketball t-shirt and trainers. He is desperately shy, apart from when talking about his first love - video games. His mum says he doesn't leave the house too much. Despite his timidity, Tomas' friend persuaded him to take migrants to the other side. They were caught on their first run by border patrol agents, and for Tomas, that was enough. "They surrounded us, arrested us and took me and my friend to jail," Tomas recalls. "We were nervous and afraid". Tomas says he doesn't really know why he chose to help guide migrants across the border, but that to some extent he found it to be a test. People smuggling is seen as a lucrative business by many families living across the border [Al Jazeera] Social workers and experts say that people smuggling often isn't just about the money. It's also about power, respect and belonging. Polleritos are almost universally male, and it plays into the Mexican macho aspiration, says Gilberto Solis. "Adolescents get together and want to prove their manhood. They put themselves to the test to feel part of a group," Solis explains. It is not just about impressing friends. There are thousands of orphans in Juarez - another result of the killing that the city has lived through. The Mexico mi Hogar team says that for many boys their cartel boss becomes a father figure, pulling them deeper into the alternate 'family' of organised crime. Mind your neighbour Jose, the 14-year-old boy from the outskirts of town, didn't want to talk about the cartels. It is understood that spilling information about the city's criminal organisations can have fatal consequences. {articleGUID} But he did think it was safe enough to show Al Jazeera the border where he plies his trade, just half a kilometre behind his house. Clambering up the hill, which offers a vantage point, Jose was animated, chatting about what's he has seen and done, the difficulties of getting across. He sat at the top, looking through a pair of binoculars at the dividing line. But he had attracted attention. A man crested the hill. After briefly speaking in Jose's ear, he stalked around the Al Jazeera crew without saying a word. Then, abruptly, he left. "He's just a neighbour," Jose said. But the smile was gone, the playful chat, abruptly extinguished. Back down outside his house, his leg began pumping nervously. "He was nobody," he continued, "but anyone can talk round here and if they tell the wrong person, you're in trouble." It was a reminder that there are risks as well as rewards to this job - for a boy who doesn't know if he'll reach 18. *Names have been changed to protect the person's identity and privacy.

Mexico's day of the dead is characterised for being an ancient and colorfoul celebration [Misael Valtierra/Al Jazeera] Every year, Mexicans gather in cemeteries to remember their departed family members. According to tradition, heaven opens on November 1 and 2 and the souls of the dead come back to earth. Today Google dedicates a doodle to this commemoration. Day of the Dead 2017 - #GoogleDoodle in 10 countries. #DayoftheDead pic.twitter.com/I7zYXPAP7k — Doodle Finder (@Doodle_Finder) November 1, 2017 A hybrid of Spanish Catholic and pre-Columbian traditions, Day of the Dead has become one of the most important celebrations, revealing what many believe to be a uniquely Mexican understanding of death. Relatives will offer food, drinks and even toys on altars to entice the souls on holiday. The living and the dead are believed to share the meals together. {articleGUID} In many parts of Mexico , familes will spend November 1 remembering the children, often referred to as angelitos (little angels), decorating their grave sites with toys and balloons, and on November 2, they will celebrate the All Souls day, dedicated to the adults who have died. During the celebration, families will decorate the graves; most will visit the cemeteries where their loved ones are and decorate them with ofrendas (altars). The place will also have the flowers of cempasuchil ( Marigold), as these are believed to help lead spirits back from the cemetery to their family homes. At least death is not hidden away: he looks at it face to face, with impatience disdain or irony Octavio Paz, mexican writer Some people enjoy writing short poems, also known as calaveras (skulls): mocking epitaphs of friends, describing interesting habits and attitudes or funny anecdotes. Newspapers use them to make fun of politicians and other people in the public scene. It is a way to laugh off the rich or powerful in an accepted way. This tradition started in the 18th or 19th century after a newspaper published a poem narrating a dream of a cemetery in the future. Another common symbol is the skull, which represents the cyclicality of life as we understand it. F oods such as sugar or chocolate skulls can be given as gifts to both the living and the dead.

At least 15 people have been killed in Yemen's coastal city of Aden, a local resident said, in an attack claimed by the local affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group. The resident, who wished to remain anonymous, told Al Jazeera that several people died in the city's Khormaksar district on Sunday after an explosives-rigged car blew up outside the criminal investigation department (CID) building. Armed men, some of whom were wearing military fatigues, then proceeded to storm the facility where clashes were "still ongoing," the source said. A separate source told Al Jazeera that at least "three terrorists" entered the CID building wearing suicide vests, but said there were no reports of hostages. "No gunfire, no explosions, the situation is currently calm," the source said. Also in Aden on Sunday, a car bomb targeted the Dar Saad-based office of Yemen's Islah (Congregation for Reform) party, the country's largest opposition group, the source said. The building was abandoned and there were no reports casualties, the source said. ISIL took responsibility for the attack on the CID building, according to its Amaq,website, claiming the armed group killed around 50 officers. Al Jazeera could not independently verify the claims. Earlier on Sunday, images posted on social media showed a pitched street battle between security personnel and unknown fighters near the CID building.

Armed groups have gained ground in the south of the country since forces loyal to President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi - backed by an Arab coalition assembled by Saudi Arabia - drove the Houthi fighters out of Aden in July last year. Since then, the government and the Arab coalition have struggled to enforce their control as ISIL and al-Qaeda use the security vacuum to carry out attacks. Sunday's violence comes a day after Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a loud explosion in Riyadh, saying they fired a long-range ballistic missile that travelled more than 800km over the border with Saudi Arabia . The war in Yemen , the Middle East's poorest country, started in 2014 after Houthi rebels seized control of the capital Sanaa and began pushing south towards the country's third-biggest city, Aden. The Yemen government has been based in Aden and Saudi Arabia since 2014. Concerned by the rise of the Houthi rebels, believed to be backed by regional rival Iran , Saudi Arabia and a coalition of Sunni Arab states launched an intervention in 2015 in the form of a massive air campaign aimed at reinstalling President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi 's government. Since then, more than 10,000 people have been killed and at least 40,000 wounded, mostly from Saudi-led air raids. SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Yemen Middle East
The Bahrain-Qatar border dispute began in the mid-1900s, mainly over the Hawar Islands and the town of Zubara. Bahrain has claimed the right to take Qatari territory, as tensions between the two Gulf countries heighten amid political deadlock . A press release published on the country's state news agency on Saturday said that Bahrain has "every right to claim what was cut off forcibly from its land and to dispute the legitimacy of the Qatari rule". The statement, which references a historic border dispute that was solved by an international court in 2001, did not specify whether Bahrain intends to take any action. It comes in the context of a broader crisis in the Gulf, in which Bahrain, the UAE , Saudi Arabia and Egypt have cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a sea, land and air blockade. The blockading countries have accused Qatar of supporting "terrorist" groups and have issued a list of demands, including the closure of the Doha-based Al Jazeera network. Qatar has vehemently denied the accusations and rejected the demands. {articleGUID} In recent weeks, Bahrain has stepped up threats against Qatar, vowing last week that it would not attend the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit, which usually takes place in December, if Qatar attended. Last week, the country imposed visa requirements on Qatari nationals and residents, in a move that Qatar called "unprecedented". Border dispute The Bahrain-Qatar border dispute began in the mid-1900s, mainly over the Hawar Islands and the town of Zubara. In 1991, Qatar referred the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), after decades of failed Saudi mediation and a narrowly avoided armed confrontation between the two countries. The issue was resolved in 2001 when the ICJ, the principal judicial branch of the United Nations, decided that Bahrain had claim over the Hawar Islands, while Qatar was awarded Zubara and the Janan Islands. Despite the issue being resolved 16 years ago, the Bahraini government said in its statement on Saturday that it had "endured the intolerable and conceded many of its internationally documented historic rights" for the benefit of the Gulf countries. {articleGUID} Alluding to the creation in 1981 of the GCC - a political and economic alliance of Gulf countries - the statement said that Bahrain had "agreed to postpone the claim of its rights, accepted the losses and gave up what is rightfully hers in order to ensure the unity of the Gulf". Jocelyn Sage Mitchell, a political science professor at Northwestern University in Qatar, said that Bahrain was merely "throwing out complaints that are long-standing and are still simmering". "If they decided that they wanted to re-pursue their territorial claims over this, that would be in contravention of the international community," Mitchell told Al Jazeera. "That would be something that would be very surprising and an ill-advised move on Bahrain's part." SOURCE: Al Jazeera News Bahrain Qatar GCC Middle East

Alt-right protesters gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia, on August 12 [File: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images/AFP] Last year, the alt-right, a hardline faction of the US far right, rallied behind Donald Trump 's campaign and celebrated his electoral victory. In turn, Trump's rhetoric - often described by watchdog groups as "dog-whistling" racists - energised the alt-right , which has grown into a loosely-knit coalition of white supremacists, white nationalist and neo-Nazis. Nine months into Trump's presidency, however, the alt-right's future is dotted with uncertainty as the movement remains embroiled in internal strife, and as it breaks from its enthusiastic support of the president and the policies it now views as a betrayal. Shane Burley, author of Fascism Today: What It Is and How to End It, explained that the alt-right's ideological contradictions with comparably mainstream Trump supporters have been heightened by recent events. "It would be really hard to see how they [the alt-right] could continue those relationships at this point," Burley told Al Jazeera. In September, the latest phase of complications between comparably mainstream Trump supporters and the hardliners in the alt-right erupted when the president decided to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in March 2018. Created by former President Barack Obama in 2012, DACA is a federal government programme that allows children who entered the US without documents to temporarily remain, work and study in the country. As part of a deal with the Democratic Party opposition, Trump said that his administration is searching for a way to allow DACA recipients - known as Dreamers - to stay in the country without giving them citizenship or amnesty. Trump stopped short of immediately repealing the programme, giving Congress six months to come up with a political solution before DACA officially ends next year. In late September, Richard Spencer , the white supremacist who coined the term "alt-right" in 2008, led a march outside the White House, where he and his supporters decried Trump's DACA decision as not strict enough. For them, anything less than a full repeal and deportation falls short. {articleGUID} Spencer, who heads the Virginia-based National Policy Institute, was joined by members of Identity Evropa, a white supremacist organisation that was established in March 2016. "Donald Trump, we are ready to dream again, but you need to become who you are," Spencer bellowed through a loudspeaker, flanked on both sides by supporters holding up a banner. "You need to be the nationalist populist that you presented [yourself to] the world as," Spencer said. Accusing Trump of becoming a mainstream Republican, Spencer continued, "We cannot support you if you are going to support DACA. We will not support you if you are going to support DACA." Spencer's anger was a far cry from the jubilance he displayed at a conference following Trump's election when he proclaimed to an audience of some 200 people: "Hail Trump! Hail victory! Hail our people!" Several attendees rose to their feet and performed Nazi-like salutes. Yet, even before Trump's backroom deals on DACA, much of the alt-right had found ample reason to criticise the president, from US intervention in the Middle East to the appointment of establishment conservatives in his administration. What did they expect? "The more ideological, career-oriented ones, such as Richard Spencer, will really be pushing against Trump in a lot of ways," Burley said. They did always see it for what it is, and they never expected [Trump] to push through a white nationalist agenda. He's not going to, and I don't think they were blind to that. According to Burley, the alt-right's support for the president was always belied by a glaring contradiction between Trump's "civic nationalism" and the movement's white nationalism. "I think that the alt-rightists who are more honest will say Trump was basically just holding the door open and that they were hoping that [Trump's policies and their politics] would line up enough," he explained. Despite this, the alt-right has continued to be a vocal proponent of Trump's anti-immigration policies, including the president's revised travel ban which is set to take effect this week. Anti-Semitism as 'the backbone' Yet, the relationship has endured ups and downs, with many on the alt-right decrying Trump's appointment of Jews in his administration. Among the Jewish officials Trump has installed are his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who serves as a senior adviser and Gary Cohn, an investment banker, who is director of the National Economic Council. Daryl Lamont Jenkins, an anti-fascist researcher and founder of the Philadelphia-based One People's Project, explained that "anti-Semitism is the backbone of their movement". In April, alt-rightists, many of whom describe themselves as anti-interventionists, expressed outrage over the US bombing of a Syrian airbase. Spencer and others held an "anti-war" demonstration in Washington, DC, after that military operation, announcing their support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. For many in the alt-right, that raid symbolised Trump's merger with neoconservative wings of the Republican Party and the supposed takeover of his administration by the "Jewish establishment". More recently, segments of the alt-right have vocally opposed Trump's threats to carry out a military attack against North Korea. Cas Mudde, author of The Far Right in America, explained that the alt-right "has never truly embraced Trump but sees him as the best available vehicle to promote their racist and white nationalist agenda". {articleGUID} Mudde, who is an associate professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia, added: "That won't change because of these policy changes, although they will be even more cautious and partial in their support." Meanwhile, as the divide grew, the alt-right, which had at one point been largely confined to online outlets and social media, has made a concerted effort to build a more formidable presence in the streets. In April, alt-rightists flocked to Berkeley, California, to join brawls between Trump supporters and anti-fascists, known colloquially as "Antifa". Identity Evropa leader Nathan Damigo was caught on tape sucker-punching a female anti-fascist during those rallies. The video, which went viral on social media, was celebrated by alt-rightists. At the time, it appeared that the alt-right was becoming increasingly capable of exerting influence on more mainstream grassroots pro-Trump protests, and it rallied at the same events as the alt-light, a comparably moderate movement that rejects the alt-right's openly white supremacist politics but shared many of its sentiments. How did Charlottesville change things? A turning point came in August, however, when hundreds of white supremacists and neo-Nazis from across the US descended on Charlottesville, Virginia, seeking to outdo a previous demonstration against the city's decision to remove a Confederate statue in May. In the run-up to that event - dubbed Unite the Right - it became clear that the hard core of the alt-right would set the tone. Groups like the National Socialist Movement and Vanguard America, a neo-Nazi organisation, had announced their plans to attend. The neo-Confederate League of the South and the Traditionalist Worker Party, headed by self-professed fascist Matthew Heimbach, urged their supporters to make the trek to Charlottesville. Many alt-light groups issued public disavowals of the alt-right before that rally. Gavin McInnes, a media personality who founded the Proud Boys, an ultra-nationalist men's fraternity, said he wouldn't attend. Alt-light social media figures such as Jack Prosebiec and Mike Cernovich denounced Unite the Right and publicly distanced themselves from the participants. On August 11, the night before the rally, a large mob of white supremacists carrying torches marched on the University of Virginia campus chanting "blood and soil" and "Jews will not replace us". Confronted by a small group of anti-racist students, the marchers attacked them with their torches until police eventually intervened. The next day, after the protest's permit was pulled and Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency, the alt-right rally participants swarmed the streets and clashed with community members, anti-racists and anti-fascists. {articleGUID} That afternoon, 20-year-old James Alex Fields, who had been photographed marching with Vanguard America earlier in the day, allegedly ploughed his car into an anti-racist march, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring 19 others. Following Heyer's killing, Republicans and Democrats both roundly condemned the alt-right. Web hosting services booted alt-right websites offline, and social media outlets cancelled accounts belonging to several of the movement's groups and prominent figures. In Florida, Texas and elsewhere, cities and universities refused to provide permits for alt-right events. The backlash from groups that once claimed to be part of the alt-right was also widespread. McInnes, who had previously said the Proud Boys were part of the alt-right, lashed out at Unite the Right organiser Jason Kessler, who described himself as both a member of the Proud Boys and an advocate of the alt-right. "We disavow the alt-right; Proud Boys are not alt-right," he said at the time during an episode of his Rebel Media YouTube show, which has since been discontinued. McInnes went on to describe Fields as a "terrorist" and murderer. McInnes deemed Kessler as a "spy" who is "disingenuous", claiming that the former journalist had attempted to infiltrate the Proud Boys and undermine the group's legitimacy. Disagreements were also rife among the solid core of the alt-right. When Kessler took to Twitter to describe the late Heyer as a "fat, disgusting communist" and insinuated she was to blame for her own killing, Spencer called on alt-rightists to no longer associate with him. "Heyer's death was deeply saddening," Spencer wrote on Twitter. "'Payback' is a morally reprehensible idea." Meanwhile, some alt-rightists celebrated Trump's weak condemnation of their movement, which he said included some "very fine people". In Trump's comments, anti-racists saw something more insidious: the president had reserved the bulk of his ire for anti-fascists, who he described as the "alt-left". David Duke, former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, and Andrew Anglin, an author at the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer blog, said the president had essentially declared his support for the alt-right and its allies. Writing on Twitter, Duke thanked Trump for condemning the "leftist terrorists" that make up the Black Lives Matter civil rights movement and Antifa. Anglin wrote: "People saying he cucked are shills and k*kes . He did the opposite of cuck. He refused to even mention anything to do with us. When reporters were screaming at him about white nationalism, he just walked out of the room." Yet, the massive outcry over the president's comments demonstrated that, in a matter of months, the alt-right went from being viewed as having played a pivotal role in Trump's election to the most marginalised it had been in the last two years. Can the alt-right bounce back? According to Mudde, Charlottesville "was an exception", alluding to the "pathetic turnout at successor rallies". Trump has given them the most momentum that they've seen in a generation, so they are not going to abandon him just yet. Daryl Lamonte Jenkins, founder of One People's Project He pointed to the participation of more traditional neo-Confederate and neo-Nazi groups at Unite the Right, who he says "aren't really part of the so-called alt-right". Their participation has intensified public anger, especially in the wake of Heyer's killing. More difficult still, several participants have since been doxxed - a term used to describe posting one's personal information, such as name, address and employer online - and several lost their jobs. Others became maligned in their communities. "Many new so-called alt-right supporters will not come again after having been doxxed or out of fear of being doxxed," Mudde concluded. Earlier this month, Spencer and around 40 of his supporters returned to Charlottesville to hold a "flash rally" that lasted around 10 minutes. Elsewhere, far-right protests have been massively outnumbered by their anti-fascist counterparts. A week after Charlottesville, an estimated 15,000 counter-demonstrators drowned out the chants of some 200 far-right protesters in Boston, Massachusetts. Against this backdrop, it remains unclear whether this public backlash against the alt-right, the infighting among its ranks and the intense marginalisation, are obstacles the movement can overcome. Factions of the far right who distanced themselves from the chaos of Charlottesville have tried to remake their movement under the banner of "the new right". Vanguard America, one of the groups that played a prominent role in the violence, renamed itself as "Patriot Front". One People's Project's Daryl Lamont Jenkins expects that the exercise in rebranding is bound to fail. The alt-right may raise its voice against decisions Trump has implemented, but it has few options, Jenkins said. "[Trump] is still for them the best hope. They knew he wasn't going to be 100 percent on board, and they have been happy with him going as far as he did," he concluded. "They have nowhere else to go. Trump has given them the most momentum that they've seen in a generation, so they are not going to abandon him just yet."

A gaggle of petty Canadian pundits and television hosts is busy trying to define Singh by the turban he wears, not the passport he carries, writes Mitrovica [Reuters] Jagmeet Singh is the Jackie Robinson of Canadian politics. Like Jackie Robinson, Singh has broken a stubborn colour barrier. Robinson famously did it in 1947 after becoming the first black man to play major league baseball in the modern era for the then Brooklyn Dodgers. (Robinson spent much of 1946 as an outfielder for the long defunct Montreal Royals.) Singh did it 70 years later, becoming the first visible minority member to lead a Canadian federal political party - the moribund, quasi-socialist New Democratic Party (NDP). So, consider this: Almost three quarters of a century after American professional baseball began the achingly slow but inevitable move towards integration, one party in Canada - that polite, strutting bastion of progressiveness - finally and belatedly followed suit, electing the first non-white male or female politician as leader of a national party, with designs, of course, to ultimately become the first non-white male or female prime minister. Canada's largely monochromatic, male-dominated establishment media noted Singh's history-making with a perfunctory nod of approval and praise. Then, it reverted with laser-like speed to parochial form, and has, since Singh's persuasive first-ballot victory on October 1, launched a collective, sustained and hyperbolic assault on his character, religious affiliation and allegiance to Canada. The unmistakable, unspoken intent of this barrage of smears masquerading as journalism is to stain and indeed shame Singh - and I'm not exaggerating here - as a terrorist sympathizer and conspiracy theorist who is not-so-secretly supportive of the break-up of Canada. {articleGUID} Singh is tasting, once more, the kind of bitter, unhinged vitriol that was hurled at Robinson from the peanut gallery when he stepped into a sports arena decades ago. And like Robinson - who wore a padded baseball cap to shield himself from racist pitchers who threw at his head - Singh has, no doubt, fashioned a means to steel himself against the slur-slinging slanderers yesterday, today and for the foreseeable future. In the meantime, a gaggle of petty Canadian pundits and television hosts is busy trying to define Singh by the turban he wears, not the passport he carries. The instantaneous "othering" of Singh began with a now notorious interview with a semi-retired CBC personality turned would-be prosecutor, who demanded to know if the newly elected leader would publicly denounce Sikhs who post "martyr" posters of the murderous architect of the 1985 Air India bombing, Talwinder Singh Parmar - yes or no. Why Singh was obliged to answer, and by implication, atone for the sins of others, is a question his CBC interrogator did not address. Still, Singh responded to the host's prosecutorial query by denouncing as a Canadian - without reservation or qualification - all forms of "heinous" terrorism against Canadians. Alas, Singh's unequivocal response was not nearly enough for sanctimonious pundits who have suddenly taken an intense interest in a terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 268 Canadians they rarely, if ever, were preoccupied with in the past. Cue the predictably melodramatic columns excoriating Singh for his phantom "failure" to condemn the poster-sized "veneration" of Parmar. Like Jackie Robinson, Singh, it seems to me, is made of sterner stuff than his pedestrian and forgettable detractors. Again, this hysterical pile-on is intended to paint a simplistic caricature of Singh as first and foremost a Sikh, not a Canadian, born and raised in Canada. As such, "the Sikh" must be treated with suspicion since he remains an outsider whose faith, not citizenship, is paramount to who he is and what he believes. Usually, these self-righteous pundits and reporters save their loaded, loyalty-laced questions exclusively for Muslim Canadians who are habitually called upon not only to distance themselves from, but instantly rebuke, fanatics who kill innocents. Yet, despite ample opportunity, these same pundits and reporters have repeatedly failed to hold other prominent Canadian politicians of other prominent faiths to even a semblance of the same measure of "account" for the easily apparent, well-documented acts of state-sanctioned terrorism visited upon so many other innocents at home and abroad. Their silence and hypocrisy on this score are as galling as they are instructive. {articleGUID} I cannot recall, for example, former Liberal cabinet minister, supposed human rights "activist" and ubiquitous corporate media darling, Irwin Cotler , ever being challenged by Canada's accountability-demanding public broadcaster to denounce the indiscriminate killing of more than 500 Palestinian children by the Israeli military - yes or no? Clearly, the "bravery" of these crowing journalists who applaud each other for daring to ask the "hard, tough" questions has its convenient and career-preserving limits. But Singh, the Sikh, is easy game. Not content to tar Singh as a closet terrorist sympathiser, a scribe at Canada's self-proclaimed "national" newspaper, The Globe and Mail - that, by the way, has ceased publishing in parts of Canada - suggested in a recent column that Singh may be a closet separatist as well. The amnesiac columnist, Konrad Yakabuski, who once dismissed charges that former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper used racially-tinged dog-whistle politics during the 2015 election as the by-product of "Harper derangement syndrome" , is accusing Singh of pursuing "dog-whistle politics" to curry favour with Quebecers. My goodness. "Mr. Singh has been upbeat in seducing separatists…[with] wink-wink encouragement," he wrote. What apparently constitutes the NDP leader's sly "seduction" of separatists? Singh has simply acknowledged the broad, established understanding that Quebecers have the right to self-determination. My goodness II. Arguably, the nadir of nastiness was reached earlier this week when a marquee, but transparently thin-skinned polemicist who threatens to sue anyone on Twitter who offends his rather fragile sensibilities, took to Twitter to malign Singh as an "apparent Air India conspiracy theorist". Please note: "conspiracy theorist" is a hack's insipid, stale code for "Singh, the Sikh, is cuckoo." Like Jackie Robinson, Singh, it seems to me, is made of sterner stuff than his pedestrian and forgettable detractors. Like Robinson, Singh has not only confronted, but vanquished his detractors with grace, eloquence and fierce determination. By his telling, Singh has done this since he was a boy growing up in rough and tumble Windsor, Ontario, where he faced and trounced much more formidable foes. Puffing punks wielding keyboards do not, I suspect, frighten Jagmeet Singh one bit.

The traditional Washing of the Feet at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem during Holy Week is a yearly Easter ritual [Reuters] Jerusalem - Palestinian Christians said they would not tolerate a repetition of the Israeli restrictions and violence which have in past years marred Holy Week festivities - culminating on Easter Sunday - and have vowed to pursue "other means" if no marked changes are made. Speaking to journalists on Tuesday, community leaders expressed concerns that Israeli restrictions will prevent them from celebrating Easter this week, beginning with the Good Friday procession in Jerusalem, where thousands flock to walk along Via Dolorosa - the path believed to have been walked by Jesus before his crucifixion. "There is one major change this year, and this is April 1, which is the day Palestine officially becomes a member of the International Criminal Court," said Bassem Khoury, a Christian from Jerusalem, and former Palestinian minister of economy. "Denial of freedom of religion is ... an issue we will pursue if we are denied [access to our holy sites]." For almost a decade, the Easter celebrations have been marked with clashes between local Christians and Israeli troops, who regularly prevent worshippers from accessing the religious sites. "Since 2005, Israel has closed the Old City of Jerusalem for us," said Hind Khoury, former Palestinian minister of Jerusalem affairs. "We arrive to celebrate Palm Sunday and Holy Friday only to find the access doors closed and many Israeli military checkpoints along the way." This Friday, pilgrims and visitors will walk down the cobbled Via Dolorosa through the walled Old City, many bearing wooden crosses, to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where tradition has it Jesus was buried before rising again three days later. Restrictions This year, Easter festivities are coinciding with the Jewish holiday of Passover. Israeli authorities impose severe restrictions on Palestinians' movement during that time, affecting both Muslims and Christians' access to Jerusalem holy sites. "Israeli authorities give some permits to Christians during religious holidays," said Fr Jamal Khader, the rector of the Latin Patriarchate Seminary, who described himself as one of the "lucky ones" to have received permission to enter Jerusalem this Easter time. "But at the same time, the access to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is restricted and during Pesach [Passover] there are even more restrictions," he said. "Permits are a means of control and this is a violation of our freedom of worship." Khader said that families from his parish often complain that permits are not given to the entire household, which often means having to drop plans to attend the Jerusalem festivities. Even those with permits cannot always take part in the processions because the Old City is "practically closed", he said. "Every year when we get here for the procession, we notice that the whole area is empty except for hundreds of soldiers and policemen," he said. "This is a real problem for regular people; it dissuades them from participating." Dwindling numbers Difficulties in reaching holy sites come at a time when Christian leaders concede that the community's numbers are in decline. In 1944, there were some 30,000 Christians living in Jerusalem's Old City, according to official figures. Today that number does not exceed 11,000. Many Palestinian Christians have complained in the past that they were beaten, shoved and prevented by Israeli forces from entering the Old City during religious holidays. Israeli authorities said they were merely using "crowd-control measures" because of the large number of visitors. This year, the Israeli tourism ministry said it is expecting about 130,000 over the period of Holy Week and Passover. "We are not happy with the measures by [the Israeli municipality of Jerusalem]," said Archbishop Fouad Twal, the Latin patriarch. "We are afraid of a repetition of last year['s events]. Sometimes I wonder whether the [Israeli] policemen know why they are there - to help or to make our lives more difficult." Last year, the UN's peace envoy to the Middle East at the time and other high-ranking diplomats were prevented from going through a barricade to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre for the "Holy Fire" procession - a traditional ceremony that takes place a day before Orthodox Easter. Israel 'blocks' UN envoy from Easter service Robert Serry said Israeli police forbade him and Italian, Norwegian and Dutch diplomats from getting to the church as he was being crushed by a waiting crowd at a barricade. They also ignored his requests to speak to a superior, he said. At the time, Serry called their behaviour "unacceptable" and demanded in a statement that all parties "respect the right of religious freedom". Israeli authorities denied Serry's charges , saying he had displayed "a serious problem of judgement". Last year, Palestinian Christian communities turned to Israel's Supreme Court, which agreed that Palestinians' rights were being violated, and that checkpoints and other restrictions were hindering access to places of worship. 'Unhindered access' This year, they received official Israeli assurances of unhindered access to the church. "I'm not 100 percent optimistic that things will go fine even though we have assurances from Israeli security, even the president himself," Bassem Khoury said. But some Christians fear that it's not only access to their holy sites that's being lost in these festivities: participating in celebrations that extend beyond the religious. Ra'ed Sa'adeh, who owns and manages the Jerusalem Hotel, said he grew up in the Old City and took part in Holy Week celebrations yearly. "Many of the activities have both religious and cultural [significance]," Sa'adeh said. "And as Christians, we are being deprived from exercising our culture. Now it's impossible to be part of the popular celebrations, which are the natural cultural expression that people have been a part of for hundreds of years."

Pope Francis exchanges gifts with Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, the Grand Mufti of Al Azhar Mosque, at the Vatican in May 2016 [Max Rossi/Reuters] In 1219, a poor Italian friar called Francis of Assisi set off on a long and perilous journey to meet the Sultan of Egypt, Malik al-Kamil. The two shores of the Mediterranean had been at war for more than a century, during which the Latin Church had tried to recover the Holy Land from Islamic rule. The Fifth Crusade was in full swing, but Francis, who would later become one of the most venerated religious figures of Christianity , was determined to meet with the Sultan and possibly stop the violence ravaging the Eastern Mediterranean, which he had strongly condemned. Historians say the meeting between the Muslim ruler and the Christian friar in Damietta was cordial, with the two men discussing the need for dialogue and peace between the two faiths. Francis could not prevent the wars that followed, but the encounter set a cornerstone in the relations between the two religions that Medieval iconography has immortalised in many paintings. Away from ideological and institutional barriers, Francis had crossed the sea to meet first and foremost "other men", whose ideas and beliefs he was eager to understand. OPINION: The legacy of the Crusades in contemporary Muslim world Eight centuries later, another Francis, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, is set to pay a two-day visit to Cairo that bears a striking similarity to the one his predecessor made. Pope Jorge Bergoglio, who chose to be named after the friar of Assisi, will visit Egypt under the motto "The Pope of Peace in the Egypt of Peace". "The motto Pope Francis has chosen is emblematic. His call for peace and the need for dialogue between East and West is as true today as it was 800 years ago at the time of Francis of Assisi," said Orazio la Rocca, an author and veteran analyst who has covered the Vatican and its Popes for more than three decades. "Violence in the name of religion was the issue then; it is still the issue today. Muslim and Christian spiritual leaders are coming together in Cairo to say that nobody can legitimately draw on religions to feed wars and terrorism." The visit of the Pope, who will arrive in Cairo on Friday, comes three weeks after two separate bombings killed 49 Egyptian Copts and injured another 120 during the Palm Sunday celebrations in churches across Egypt. The head of Egypt's Coptic Church, Pope Tawadros II, was leading prayers in the Cathedral of Alexandria before a suicide bomber blew himself up at the gate of the church. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attacks. Considering the expansion of the circle of wars and violence and the rise in terrorism and sectarianism, the voice of reason calls us to seek the means of cooperation rather than seeking conflicts. Al Azhar statement But if the bombings aimed to cast a shadow on the Papal journey, they had the opposite reaction: the Pope is even more determined to fulfil the visit, sources close to the Vatican said. "The tragic events that hit the Coptic Church make the gesture of the Pope and his meetings in Cairo even more significant. It's the bravery of peacemakers and the goodwill of all the spiritual leaders involved to make the visit possible, despite the security risks involved," said Marco Tarquinio, the director of Avvenire, a Catholic newspaper. Pope Francis will meet with Sheikh Muhammad Ahmed al-Tayeb, Grand Mufti of Al Azhar University, the most prestigious centre of learning in the Sunni Muslim world. He will also meet with Pope Tawadros II and pay a courtesy visit to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi . Sheikh Tayeb and the Roman Pontiff will deliver a speech at an international peace conference convened by the theological university. The event, with 300 delegates from all over the world, is meant to call for peace between religious leaders, societies and countries of the world, Al Azhar said in a statement. "Considering the expansion of the circle of wars and violence and the rise in terrorism and sectarianism, the voice of reason calls us to seek the means of cooperation rather than seeking conflicts … To respect instead of rejecting each other, to live in peace instead of fighting and to tolerate instead of being fanatical," said Al Azhar.

PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The Grand Mufti has also invited to Al Azhar the Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople, a long-time champion of interfaith dialogue. Tayeb will thus bring together Christian leaders from the East and West, as Cairo goes into lockdown following the announcement of a three-month state of emergency after the Easter bombings. The Pope and the Patriarch will find a battered Coptic community, exhausted by the continuous threats and persecutions that are causing the exodus of hundreds of families from the Sinai Peninsula and Upper Egypt towards the northern cities of the country. In areas controlled by Salafists, such as the Minya region, reports have emerged of continuous physical and psychological harassment of Copts, ranging from the beatings of women in the streets to stone-throwing. Incidents have been reported of Coptic homes and places of worship being set on fire, while people have reportedly been asked to restrain their religious services or the display of religious symbols. Egyptian Copts number about eight million and represent about 10 percent of the total Egyptian population. They are the biggest Christian community in the Middle East, and their survival may become the testbed for the rising interfaith dialogue that the Grand Mufti of Al Azhar wishes to champion. "Acquitting religions of terrorism is no longer enough," Tayeb said in a significant speech delivered in February. "We need to take a step forward by bringing the principles and ethics of religions into this tumultuous reality." With the conference in Cairo, the Grand Mufti, who also chairs the Muslim Council of Sages, hopes to champion a new course that he said should stem primarily from spiritual leaders. "Tensions between religious leaders have no reason to exist today … There needs to be peace between those who preach religion … Those who do not possess something cannot transmit it to others," Tayeb said. OPINION: Holy Week for Egypt's Copts will never be the same Imam Yahia Pallavicini, president of the Islamic Religious Community of Italy, said interfaith dialogue should be supported by a coordinated effort to translate humanitarian and universal messages into tangible working programmes. "We need to share a common vision and a common work to defend religious plurality, where no space should be left to ambiguity. We need to build a common front against the brainwashing and manipulation of religions without hesitation, separating good from bad apples," Pallavicini said, noting that religious plurality "is part of our society". "The time when faith, nation and colour of one's skin were one thing, is over," the imam said. "As theologians, we should guide Muslims to find a balance between citizenship and religious coherence, away from bigotry and useless formalisms." In this context, the visit of Pope Bergoglio also holds political meaning. While politicians both in the East and the West are busy building barriers and fanning the flames of a religious war, the Pope is flying to Cairo to send out exactly the opposite message, Tarquinio said. "The Pope fills a political void. Spiritual leaders in Egypt will show the efficacy of simple gestures in building bridges between communities, in stark contrast to the ineptitude of those politicians who dangerously manipulate the religious discourse for other gains," he said.

In 2016, there was an average of 10 attacks a day targeting refugees and their housing in Germany [Sorin Furcoi/Al Jazeera] Berlin, Germany - On a brisk Wednesday evening in early March, a group of people walk towards a small building attached to the Immanuelkirche, an Evangelical church in eastern Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg neighbourhood. Propped on the wall beside the door is a chalkboard. Scrawled across it and flanked by a pair of fuchsia hearts is a greeting: "Welcome to Meet 'n Eat. Come in!" Meet 'n Eat was started to bring together newly arrived asylum seekers and locals [Sorin Furcoi/Al Jazeera] PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Inside, children chase each other around. From the cafeteria-style benches comes laughter and the clanking of cutlery against plates. Dozens of people - Germans, Syrians, Iraqis, Afghans and emigres from across Europe - meet here each Wednesday for Meet 'n Eat, a project that brings them together to cook and eat with the aim of fostering a sense of community between newly arrived asylum seekers and other residents of the neighbourhood. WATCH: The New Germans - the Arabs making Germany home (47:39) "We thought it's very important that people - refugees and Germans - just meet, for political reasons and just for the neighbourhood," says Juliane Wolf, one of the project's founders. Administered by Wolf and her fellow volunteers, Meet 'n Eat was made possible when the church decided to lend them the space more than a year and a half ago. Jens Henke, a 34-year-old member of the church's council, says that contributing a space to Meet 'n Eat and other projects, such as the establishment of an interfaith preschool, are part of the Christian community's efforts to prevent the rise of the anti-refugee sentiment that has taken root in some parts of German society. Henke stands on a second-floor gallery that overlooks rows of pews. Behind him, the vast brass tubes of a pipe organ climb the church's stone wall. Jens Henke, 34, is a member of the church's council [Sorin Furcoi/Al Jazeera] "The middle of society doesn't have answers to all the questions, so it's important that the church creates platforms for a dialogue toward a better understanding between citizens, immigrants and refugees," he explains. "We especially invite people who have no relation to refugees and who have questions [to participate in such dialogue]," he continues, adding that Meet 'n Eat has been so successful that its weekly participation of around 60 to 80 people is "more people than the church has on some Sundays". READ MORE: The time a mob awaited refugees in the German town of Clausnitz Hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers have made it to the country since 2015, sparking a sharp rise in far-right populism that has sent shivers through German society. And for people like Henke, the struggle for solidarity with refugees and migrants is part of the churches' - both Catholic and Evangelical - more than seven-decade struggle for atonement over their complicity in the crimes of the Nazi regime (1933-1945). Historical responsibilities Some 56 percent of Germany's population of 82 million identify as Christian. They are split almost evenly between Catholicism and Evangelical Protestantism, according to a 2015 study conducted by the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD). Silke Radosh-Hinder, a 46-year-old pastor, wears thin-rimmed rectangular glasses and a heavy black coat that nearly touches the floor when she takes a seat on the edge of a pew. At the far end of the church hall is a painting of angels perched at the feet of Jesus, who is draped in a pearl-coloured robe and gazing reverently towards the heavens. Silke Radosh-Hinder is head of a 22-congregation alliance of churches in Berlin-Brandenburg [Sorin Furcoi/Al Jazeera] Radosh-Hinder, who is also head of a 22-congregation alliance of churches in Berlin-Brandenburg, says that Christians have a historical and moral responsibility to fight against far-right sentiment. "The advantage of faith communities and the church is our mission: That every human was created in the image of God. Everybody is equal and has equal rights, so we stand up for diversity." Gesticulating, and pointing the occasional accusatory finger, she decries far-right groups like Alternative for Germany (AfD), an anti-refugee political party expected to enter the German Bundestag later this year. For Radosh-Hinder, the AfD, which claims to fight for "traditional" Christian values, doesn't believe "that people are equal, [and is] denying the truest values of our faith and Biblical scriptures". READ MORE: Meet the Syrian refugee giving back to Germany But for decades, German churches, like many across Europe, have grappled with their complicity in the genocide inflicted on European Jews during the second world war. During the Holocaust (1933-1945), more than six million Jews were systematically exterminated, and the Nazi regime carried out the mass killing of millions of ethnic and political minorities, among them Roma, Poles, Slavs, communists and anarchists. Immanuelkirsche, an Evangelical church in east Berlin, was built in the 19th century [Sorin Furcoi/Al Jazeera] With anti-Semitism deeply ingrained throughout Europe, and Germany growing increasingly polarised due to a depressed economy and rising violence between nationalists and communists, most German Christians accepted Adolf Hitler's rise to power. Historians may debate the extent of the two churches' complicity, but the complicity itself is rarely questioned. The Nazi Party appealed to Christians with nationalism and open anti-Semitism. Article 24 of the party's platform, published in 1920, described "positive Christianity" as a force against "the Jewish-materialistic spirit" at home and abroad. It claimed to respect the freedom of all religious groups that "do not endanger" the state or the "Germanic race". IN PICTURES: Refugees and Germans come together for 'Meet 'n Eat' And within both the Catholic and Protestant churches, many prominent officials and thinkers pledged their support for the Nazi regime. Dissent was rarer and often confined to individuals and small groups who spoke and acted against Nazism. Jutta Weduwen, director of Action Reconciliation Service for Peace (ARSP), a German organisation established to challenge the legacy of Nazism, says that "the churches - not just the society as a whole - didn't resist enough against Hitler and Nazism". Jutta Weduwen says that 'Hitler was also supported by the churches' [Sorin Furcoi/Al Jazeera] ARSP was established in 1959 by the council of the Evangelical Church of Germany and Lothar Kreyssig, a judge who, during the Third Reich, had been a member of the Confessing Church, a movement within Protestantism that opposed the Nazi regime's efforts to consolidate all Protestant churches into a single body with allegiance to the government. Weduwen explains that the group's founding was not just inspired by a hope to foster dialogue between different segments of society but also for historical reconciliation: "It was to admit that Hitler was also supported by the churches." The rise of far right 'alternatives' The AfD has earned a reputation as the country's most influential and aggressive anti-refugee force, making it the topic of much debate within Christian communities. Some wonder how to reconcile Christian values with, for instance, former AfD leader Frauke Petry's call for border guards to open fire on refugees attempting to enter the country. "No policeman wants to fire on a refugee, and I don't want that either," she told the Mannheimer Morgen regional paper in January 2015, but "police must stop refugees [from] entering German soil" nonetheless. READ MORE: Remembering one of the most disturbing resurgences of right-wing violence in Germany since Nazism In February, the AfD's popularity in the polls peaked at around 15 percent. Although it has since declined, the party is still expected to surpass the five-percent threshold to enter the national parliament for the first time in elections later this year. Anette Schultner is the national spokesperson for Christians in the far-right Alternative for Germany party [Sorin Furcoi/Al Jazeera] In 2013, Anette Schultner decided to leave the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of Germany, the ruling party headed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel , for reasons related to her faith. Sitting in a meeting room in Berlin, she recalls later joining the far-right populists and becoming the national spokesperson for the party's group Christians in the AfD. "I recognised that it was a conservative political force in Germany's future," she says, citing her fierce opposition to same-sex marriage, reproductive rights and challenges to traditional gender roles. "Conservatism is an important part of democracy, and the AfD is the party that can move these ideas forward." READ MORE: How the murder of a four-year-old boy exposed the dangers awaiting refugees in Germany Since the eruption of the refugee crisis in mid-2015, Schultner, who claims Muslims aim to establish Islamic law in Europe, has become a vocal proponent of the AfD's anti-migration proposals. "It's highly questionable whether they're really refugees from war-torn countries," she says, evoking an oft-employed far-right claim that most asylum seekers are simply hoping to find work. She claims they will "effectively rob" Germany of its national identity. In May, Schultner participated in a debate in Berlin about the AfD and Christianity. Although a petition opposing her appearance gained more than 1,600 signatures, she showed up nonetheless. Her calls for mass deportations and harsh restrictions on abortions elicited jeers from the audience. Near the end of the event, a 16-year-old boy ascended the pulpit and unfurled a t-shirt that read: "No human is illegal". Schultner's particular brands of Islamophobia and xenophobia are not unique in the AfD, which has called for a ban on mosque minarets, the full face veil and the Muslim call to prayer. The mass influx of refugees has led to a rise in anti-Muslim violence and anti-migration protests [Sorin Furcoi/Al Jazeera] In April 2016, leading party member Alexander Gauland proclaimed that Germany must remain "a Christian country" and "Islam is a foreign entity". He was recently put forward as a candidate in the upcoming elections. At the party's conference a month earlier, delegates drafted a manifesto that stated, "Islam is not part of Germany". Critics and political opponents say the AfD is partly to blame for inciting the wave of anti-refugee violence that has gripped Germany. Last year, the interior ministry documented 3,533 attacks on refugees and their accommodations - nearly 10 a day. 'One or two miracles' Despite a surge in far-right sentiment since the refugee crisis started, overall public opinion has changed little throughout those two years, with nearly 37 percent of Germans believing that the country can overcome the challenges of mass migration. And while it is unclear if there exists a correlation between religiosity and support for the AfD, many of Germany's religious leaders have taken a firm stance against the party. READ MORE: Confronting the colonial roots of racism in Germany In February 2016, Bishop Ulrich Neymeyr shone a spotlight on the AfD when he promised to switch off the lights of Erfurt Cathedral during weekly AfD rallies led by Bjorn Hoecke, former party leader in the German state of Thuringia. Speaking to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper at the time, Neymeyr argued that because the AfD's principles were incompatible with Christianity, he planned to deny them an illuminated and "magnificent backdrop" for their rallies. A year later, Hoecke sparked a fierce battle within the party when he called for a "180-degree turn" and urged Germans to abandon feelings of "national guilt" over the Holocaust. Henning Flad argues that people of faith have a 'duty to speak out against far-right populism' [Sorin Furcoi/Al Jazeera] Henning Flad is project director of the Federal Working Group on the Church and Right-wing Extremism, an umbrella group that includes several Christian organisations (among them ARSP). The group was founded in 2010, on the eve of a massive neo-Nazi protest in the eastern city of Dresden, to provide a peaceful alternative to far-right populism. It operates through outreach and counselling and by organising educational seminars and distributing literature that provides guidance for identifying far-right sentiment among congregations and stresses theological grounds for combating racism , homophobia and Islamophobia. READ MORE: Dresden's welcome cafes for refugees "The best way to prevent this is by not waiting until people already have really extremist ideas, but rather to talk to people about their insecurities and fears before that can happen," Flad says. "We have a duty to speak out against the far right," he adds, "and the main people who profit from polarisation … are on the far right. The more heated [the public discussion] gets, the more those with simple, black-and-white answers benefit." Back in the Immanuelkirsche church, Pastor Radosh-Hinder says she hopes for "one or two miracles" to stem the tide of racism and anti-refugee violence. "If you decide to vote for the far-right populists, you take the whole package," she warns. "And this package is very violent. You cannot just choose one topic … That is a very frightening package for society and certainly for democracy."

Pope Francis encouraged the bishops in the synod to speak openly, writes Walsh [AP] The headline on the front cover of the latest issue of the London-based Catholic weekly The Tablet reads "Seismic shifts in Rome". The paper was in print before the final gathering of the Catholic Church's synod of Bishops, so the editors hedged their bets by adding a question mark. A wise move. In the end, the synod did not bring about seismic shifts in Catholic doctrine and practice, not even a small earthquake, only the mildest of tremors. Pope Francis, who had at the beginning urged the bishops to be bold, was frequently photographed with his face hidden in his hands. The devout may have thought he was praying: in a more realistic assessment he was burying his head in despair at the intransigence of a number of the Church's senior prelates. There were gathered 189 of them with voting rights, drawn from episcopal conferences around the world, together with some added by the Pope himself. Such synods, the creation in 1965 of Pope Paul VI who was beatified (a major step on the way to being denominated a saint) the day the synod closed, meet on a regular basis to discuss matters of concern to the global Church. This was an "Extraordinary" synod, so called because it was an addition to the usual sequence.

With the papal veto on artificial means of contraception - largely down to the same Pope Paul - as well as perceived hostility to any form of homosexual activity and especially to same-sex marriage, and a blanket ban on remarriage within the Church for those who have been divorced, the family, or indeed sexual activity in general, is a peculiarly neuralgic topic for Catholics. It was no secret that Pope Francis wanted the Church to adopt a more welcoming stance (the word "welcoming" was used in the first version of the synod's closing statement) towards gays, and to find a way to re-admit to the sacraments those whose first marriages had ended in divorce and who had subsequently remarried. These policies were rejected, not by most of the bishops at the synod, but they were not accepted by the necessary two-thirds majority. If the Vatican had been a secular state with Francis as its president, his government would have fallen. He would be considering resignation. " The Roman Catholic church will never be a democracy ", the Guardian newspaper reminded its readers in an editorial as the synod opened. It was fair comment. The Pope in Rome is the last surviving dictator in the western world. He could have changed the Church's policies with a simple ukase. Catholics are by and large an obedient lot, and though many traditionalists might not have liked the changes he wanted, few would have gone off into schism. Probably. Francis chose to act otherwise, to debate the issues and strive to achieve consensus. Those on the outside may not realise what an enormous change that is. He encouraged the bishops in the synod to speak openly and to speak boldly. No Pope since the death of Pope John XXIII in 1963, and very few before that, would have borne so calmly some of the direct criticism of his stance. Of his two immediate predecessors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, the first would have lost his temper, the second retreated into silence. In both pontificates, debate was quashed: as the Guardian remarked, the Church is not a democracy. But now debate has been reopened, and will go on for a year, at least until the second part of the synod on the family ends next October. There will be time for reflection, theological and pastoral, on the disputed questions at this year's meeting. Pope Francis has ordered that the whole of the final statement be published, including those paragraphs which did not gain the required majority. There will be much discussion about them among theologians and prelates - alas, all too rarely the same people. There will also be changes in personnel. Not all those who came to Rome this year will be back in 2015. Some of those in influential Vatican positions will have been removed from their posts and replaced by clerics more sympathetic to the aims of Pope Francis, the obvious example being that most outspoken critic of the Pope, the American Cardinal Raymond Burke. Burke has already acknowledged his pending demotion despite it not yet being made public. Francis has also changed the membership of the Vatican committee which appoints bishops: it can now be expected to choose those whose theology and pastoral practice mirror that of the Pope. Some of these new men may make it to the 2015 Synod. The "seismic shift" has not yet occurred, but it will. Expect a tsunami.

The Sistine Chapel is one of the greatest masterpieces of European art, writes Walsh [Getty] Is the Pope a Catholic? After the recent synod of the bishops of Pope Francis' church, there would seem to be some prelates around the world who doubt it. Whether the pope is a Roman Catholic is an even more problematic question. "Are you aware that I don't know Rome?" he recently told a journalist from the Italian newspaper Il Messagero . "Just consider that I saw the Sistine Chapel for the first time when I took part in the conclave that elected Benedict XVI." Six million visitors a year jostle their way into the Sistine Chapel to enjoy, if that be possible within such a scrum, a 20-minute glimpse of Michelangelo's masterpiece. So the fact that the former Archbishop of Buenos Aires, despite frequent trips to Rome as a member of the College of Cardinals, had never been one of those millions, is a little surprising.

From 1980 to 1994, the frescoes in the world's most famous chapel were painstakingly restored - not always, it has to be said, with the approval of art historians, some of whom think the paint now to be too garish. Before 1980, there were about 1.5 million visitors annually. By 2011, the number had reached some 5 million plus. Now, with Pope Francis apparently attracting even more visitors to Rome, there are 20,000 per day. On the last Sunday of the month when entrance to the Chapel (and the Vatican's museums) is free, the number rises to 30,000. They are, particularly in the summer months, a sweaty lot. The Sistine Chapel is an airless place, the only entrance being through the Vatican Palace. There is no door, no window, which opens onto the outside world, thus making it the perfect place to isolate the Cardinal electors when they set about, in conditions of greatest secrecy, the business of choosing a new Pope. But if spies (in the past) and journalists (in modern times) cannot find a way in, nor can fresh air. New lighting, the better to display the frescoes, and new controls of temperature and humidity, the better to preserve them against the environmental threat posed by the crowds, have been installed very recently. It was an expensive operation, half the cost being borne by the Vatican and half by the European Union. Rightly so. The Sistine Chapel is one of the greatest masterpieces of European art. Everything is saleable And that is the problem. While Pope Francis urges his followers and the world's governments to take more care of the poor, he presides over the world's most valuable collection of treasures. If sold, the money could lift millions out of destitution. Pope Paul VI, whom Francis has just beatified, was so conscious of this paradox that he sold the papal tiara - the triple-tiered crown used in his coronation - to raise alms for the poor. It was bought by an American cardinal, and there has never been a papal "coronation" since. But not everything is saleable. Certainly not the Sistine Chapel. The next best thing is to allow its use as a money-making enterprise with the profits going to the poor. It has long been possible to secure privileged after-hours access to the Vatican museums: the Canadian singer Justin Bieber was reported to have spent over $30,000 on an exclusive tour - only to be rebuked by Vatican officials for turning up unsuitably dressed (shorts and baseball cap) and kicking a football about in a Vatican courtyard. Money earned this way has gone to support the museums. Now Porsche, or rather its Travel Club, has arranged a $8,000-a-head five-day trip to Rome, complete with an exclusive concert in the Sistine Chapel for its 40 paying customers. In return, Porsche is to make a donation to the Vatican - one hopes a substantial one. The money will go to the poor. As someone who, at the expense of one company or another, has sipped wine among the British Museum's Elgin Marbles and eaten canapes while being gazed upon by portraits by Titian and Rembrandt in London's National Gallery, I am in no position to ask whether nothing is sacred any more. Quite the contrary: As it is impossible for the Pope to sell the Sistine Chapel, then at least it can be used to raise funds for the alleviation of poverty. In any case, I sometimes wonder whether we have the right attitude regarding places of worship. Are we treating them too reverently? The Sistine Chapel is known now as the place cardinals meet to elect a new pope, but when first built, it was one of the gathering places of the papal court, with its flamboyant dress and even more flamboyant intrigues and assignations. Compared to that, or to Mr Bieber, a group of greying German worthies gathered for a concert appears positively reverential.

A crusader is shot by a Muslim warrior during the Crusades, circa 1250 [Hulton Archive/Getty Images] It is always debatable whether the Crusades remain relevant in Arab political rhetoric. Islamists in general believe that the Crusades are relevant because they resemble - in their minds - current Western and Israeli wars in our region. Many Islamists still label Western governments, and even Christians as a whole, as "Crusaders". As offensive as that sounds, it reflects a historical continuity on their part in analysing the "West". Bernard Lewis thought that Muslims are too obsessed with the Crusades; Orientalists often complain that Arabs are too historical-minded.

It has been made relevant by virtue of the consistently anti-Islamic rhetoric of people and governments in the West. When the President-elect of the United States, Donald Trump, calls for an official ban on the entry of all Muslims to the country, when various cities and governments in the West innovate various restrictive and repressive laws tailored against Islam and Muslims, and when a major US minister, Franklin Graham (who gave the inaugural prayers for George W Bush upon taking the oath of office), gains followers as he insults Islam and its Prophet, Muslims see a link. It is not irrational for Muslims to see parallels between the modern forms of Islamophobia and the historical Christian animosities towards Islam and Muslims. Even the last Pope, Benedict XVI, spoke about Islam, in the pseudo-academic Orientalist language of yesteryears, in the same manner that Christian polemicists spoke about Islam in Latin in medieval times. Islamists, and even Muslims and Arabs, see that there is a powerful Western (religious and secular) ideology of hostility stretching from the times of the Crusades to the 21st century. The Crusades were not a passing event in world history. It was an official, divinely argued attempt to eradicate a religion and a civilisation due to religious bigotry - and also for economic reasons that were disguised behind religious rhetoric. They were also an occupation project that intended to subjugate the natives through colonial-settler communities and kingdoms. Westerners rarely took note of the cruelties of the Crusades not only against local Muslims but also against local Christians and Jews. The Crusades - in their various phases and campaigns - stretched over several centuries and it is doubtful that Western governments and people realise the catastrophic impact of those campaigns. Western governments always want Arabs and Muslims to forget and forgive Western wars and military campaigns against Arabs and Muslims, regardless of whether they were from the 11th century or from 2003. It is all too convenient for Western governments and commentators to wish that Arabs would erase their memories.

They reveal to Arabs and Muslims that their very presence in their own lands and countries is subject to Western rejection and forcible eviction. Islamists may exaggerate the role of religion as an impulse for the Crusades - historians often point to other political and economic factors - but what is unmistakable is that the language of Western conquest has not improved. Western bombing and occupation of Arab and Muslim lands still adheres to the bigoted rhetoric of the Crusades; and sovereignty of Arabs in their own countries is of little significance to Western governments. Ironically, the Crusades in Western imagination - in literature and arts - are still romanticised and portrayed heroically. Even Ridley Scott's 2005 movie Kingdom of Heaven missed the mark on many of the facts and presented the Arabs inaccurately and insensitively. Sometimes it seems that the Westerners are more obsessed with the Crusades than the Arabs. But the Arabs notice, and will continue to notice, the resemblance between current Western political rhetoric and vulgar hostility and hatred of Muslims with the papal rhetoric of the Crusades.

It does not revolve around religious issues, although the language of hostility and conflict draws upon religious terms and jargon. The fact that the underlying causes of Arab and Muslim antipathy to Western governments are political in nature refutes the classical Orientalist assumptions about the centrality of religion in Arab political behaviour and thought. The notion that the basis of Arab resentment against the West is purely religious is a deliberate attempt by Western governments to deny responsibility for their wars and actions in the region. Historical events last or vanish depending on their relations to modern realities. No Arabs today hold grudges against the Mongols, for example. The political salience of the Crusades is related to the ability of average Muslims to see resonance from the times of the Crusades in the rhetoric and behaviour of Western governments. To be sure, the notion that all current behaviour in the West is driven by a deep religious factor misses the point. But secular and religious movements in the West often attribute similar hostile tendencies to Islam and Muslims: some Western atheists today are as dedicated to agitating against Islam and Muslims as American evangelical Christians. Ultimately, understanding between people and religions is not settled by changes in words or even by historical apologies - rarely offered in the case of Muslims despite the perfunctory apology by Pope John II for the Crusades. Muslims and Arabs are not holding a grudge against the West for the Crusades but for the current injustices and wars imposed by Western governments on Arabs and Muslims. The fact that the ideology of hostility against Islam and Muslims continues to prevail in Western societies allows Islamists and others to draw - rarely useful and politically unfair - religious analogies between the past and the present. But it is up to Western governments - and not to Islamist demagogues - to make the Crusades a relic of the forgotten past.

The focus in any discussion of Middle Eastern Christians should be on eradicating ISIS and the threat it poses to non-Muslims and Muslims, writes Shebaya [Youssef Boudlal/Reuters] When it started raining during President Donald Trump's inauguration ceremony, Reverend Franklin Graham interpreted it as a sign of God's blessing. A few hours earlier, Trump had heard from Pastor Robert Jeffress that "it is God who removes and establishes leaders". Trump is not an obvious candidate to represent the Jesus-like, enemy-loving, turn-the-other-cheek, self-sacrificial servant-leader of the Christian gospels. But he has made it clear that he understands his role as a defender and protector of Christianity: from statements such as "we are going to say Merry Christmas again!" to his pledge that "We will respect and defend Christian Americans. Christian Americans." His rhetoric tailors to a persecution complex prevalent in some evangelical and other conservative circles. "We are going to protect Christianity," Trump asserts, "Christianity, it's under siege." As one commentator put it , "There is a sickness in American Christianity, and Trump is feeding on it." It is precisely such statements that have made Trump the darling of some Middle Eastern Christians in the midst of what they perceive to be a systematic onslaught on the Christian presence in the region. According to Najwa Najib , (a London-born, Chicago-based Lebanese-Assyrian Christian), Trump is good for, and has the support of, Middle Eastern Christians because "'Protects Christians' is the main, though rudimentary, deciding factor there, given how few options we have and how great the risk to our continued presence in the Middle East is." In a piece she wrote that was cross-published by Richard Spencer on Jihad Watch, Najib claims that "American presidential candidates aren't good for Middle Eastern Christians. That is, they weren't, before Trump ... Middle Eastern Christians have a voice now. We fit." Friends of Donald J Trump in Lebanon 's facebook page proudly posted Trump's tweet on January 29: "Christians in the Middle East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!" - prompting one user to comment, "it's as if Muslims in the region are living in tranquility!" Clash of civilisations? Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5256754304001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5256754304001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: The Christian Quran teacher of Al Minya (1:00) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY Trump has successfully marketed himself as the protector of Middle Eastern Christians just as Vladimir Putin - described by the International Christian Union as the man "to whom Christians resorted to prevent the expansion of ISIS in the East" - has done in relation to some Syrian and Lebanese Christians, in particular. Ostensibly, there is no harm in having a US president champion your cause. Who wouldn't want Donald Trump to protect Middle Eastern Christians if they are indeed being persecuted? Upon closer scrutiny, however, such claims are nothing more than a cheap political exploitation of Middle Eastern Christians as pawns to score points on the domestic front. As Daniel Williams pointed out in the Washington Post, "it is less a show of concern for Christians than a shot at his predecessor … to show that he cares more about them than Obama did, presumably to please some of his American Christian supporters." Furthermore, the far right uses "minorities" in their political discourse and ideologies as examples of how Islam hates anything associated with the West and how Islamic values are inherently incompatible with Western values. As Najib unequivocally expressed: "We can now interject with a pointed 'um, no' when Muslims in the West claim that they pose no danger to America because they live 'side-by-side with Christians' back home … We can warn people about what happens when you give Muslims an inch." The problem with said discourse is not in the fact that Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East (such as the Yazidis and Baha'is, among others) do have valid concerns and legitimate grievances - and these differ from country to country owing to different political and religious contexts. Indeed, Muslim-majority nations should be open to an honest discussion in relation to the treatment of non-Muslims, and to reform laws and practices that violate the freedom of religion and conscience. Nonetheless, the danger in Trump's narrative lies in the conceptualisation of a clash of civilisations between a Muslim and a Western bloc, with Christians residing in the Middle East forming a sort of "external" or "foreign" phenomenon that needs to be saved in isolation of the geographical, political, economic, social, and cultural milieu they have been born into and have been interacting with for generations. Trump's proposals can only save Middle Eastern Christians in the way that the US 'saves' Israelis: by giving them preferential treatment as colonial settlers in need of support and protection. As the Archbishop of Westminster Cardinal Vincent Nichols said about the "Muslim ban", it encourages "the 'false notion' of a conflict between Christians and Muslims while wrongly suggesting Christianity is a 'Western phenomenon'." It is also worth noting briefly that the notion itself of "Middle Eastern Christians" is problematic . Do they form one bloc? Can Christians in any Middle Eastern country be treated as a single entity? Will Trump save Syrian Christians and Palestinian Christians? Or are Palestinian Christians not part of his concern, given the unchallenged supremacy of Israel's interests in US foreign policy? In fact, Trump's proposals can only save Middle Eastern Christians in the way that the US "saves" Israelis: by giving them preferential treatment as colonial settlers in need of support and protection. But a good portion - arguably a majority - of Christians in the region, judging from the statements of the clergy and politicians, do not see themselves as the Israelis do in relation to the US. Louis Raphael Sako , Archbishop of the Chaldean Church in Iraq, described Trump's travel ban that maintained an apparent special provision for Christians as a "trap" for Middle Eastern Christians and as ultimately harmful in the long run. Such notions, he said, feed into extremist ideologies that view Christians in the Middle East as "foreign bodies, and as groups protected and supported by Western powers". Those who need support, according to Sako, should not split up or religiously categorise the region. Sako's statements echoes a vast body of literature and official Church documents, especially since the Second Vatican Council, that lay out the vision for cooperation, coexistence, dialogue, shared lives, solidarity, empathy, and a coming together rather than an isolationist view of a Christian Church that sees Muslims as the "other". Suffice it to mention a relevant point from the 1992 Easter Letter on the Christian presence in the East from the Council of Eastern Catholic Bishops. It states that "it is not enough for some of us to be [living] next to each other, but we ought to be with one another, for the good of the human being in our countries." OPINION: Diversity in disunity in the Middle East One bishop interpreted it as meaning: together (Christians and Muslims), we defend the suffering human being in our Orient, and we defend his rights and dignity. This is not what some would describe as left-leaning politically correct propaganda. It is a representative sample of what the various conservative Eastern Christian Churches preach and seek to practise, especially in times of crisis when their declared mission to be witnesses to the Gospel is put to the test. In this light, the focus in any discussion of Middle Eastern Christians should be on eradicating ISIL and the threat it poses to non-Muslims and Muslims - and to anyone who does not adhere to their ideology, including atheists. The focus should equally be upon the needs for justice and accountability on account of the crimes against humanity and war crimes that have taken place in Syria and Yemen; and on the socioeconomic problems in the region exacerbated by corruption and oppressive regimes - without forgetting the continued oppression of the Palestinian people and any member of a minority who is being persecuted or discriminated against on grounds of religion, belief, race, sexual orientation, political opinion and gender. "It is not enough to be next to each other, but we ought to be with one another." Any individual who preaches otherwise should be considered a false prophet, not a saviour.

In the city of Sao Paulo, Celso Russomanno is vying for the mayor's post, running on his record as a defender of consumer rights. While he emphasises that he is a political and not a religious candidate, the fact that he is a devout Christian and a dedicated family man may appeal to some voters. Taking cinema to the pulpit: Brazil's evangelical film "My party is not owned by any evangelical church. Almost 80 percent of those in the party come from different religions," Russomanno told Al Jazeera. No one church dominates Brazilian politics. But as the evangelical movement grows, its messages of what it calls "traditional values and strong adherence to the Bible" increasingly permeate society. "I believe that over the years, evangelical Christians realised they should get involved in politics in order to set some principles, to offer society those principles we share as a Christian community," Paulo de Carvalho, a pastor, said. The growing influence of evangelicals is causing concern among some Brazilians [Al Jazeera] Carvalho's congregation may interpret those principles differently, but generally agree that with Brazil mired in a scandal that has sucked in politicians and business leaders, the country needs a different direction. "When voting, yes, I take into consideration religion and the values shared by the candidates. They don't need to be Christians but they need to have ethical values," Daniela Cruz, a secretary and member of Carvalho's church, told Al Jazeera. Anti-Rousseff vote Evangelical politicians largely voted to impeach President Dilma Rousseff for mismanagement of funds, but also because her generally secular Workers' Party, in office for 13 years, supported same-sex marriage and discussed abortion. There are many reasons why the evangelical church - and its influence on mainstream politics - is growing in Brazil.

Evangelical followers donate a percentage of their income to churches that have become rich, running television stations that continue to win converts, mostly in poor neighbourhoods. Their growing influence is causing some concern. "The growth in evangelical Christianity is taking place without a deep discussion of the values enshrined in our historical character," Rogerio Baptistini, of Mackenzie Presbyterian University, said. "We are an open and tolerant society, but this sudden growth threatens rationality, the denial of the other, the diverse, the different." Brazil still has more Roman Catholics than any other country in the world, estimated at 135 million and representing about 65 percent of the population But as more and more followers leave and go to a vibrant and increasingly influential evangelical movement, the political character of Brazil continues to change.

RenderPagesVideo('5414699735001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Pope Francis said violence cannot be committed in the name of God, in a speech at a Muslim-Christian conference in Egypt . The 80-year-old touched down at Cairo airport on Friday before he was ushered in a car to meet Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi . Francis is in Egypt on a 27-hour visit to push for dialogue with Muslims and support the country's embattled Christian minority that has suffered a series of attacks. "Peace alone ... is holy and no act of violence can be perpetrated in the name of God, for it would profane his name," the Catholic pontiff said. He also warned against rising populism. "Demagogic forms of populism are on the rise. These certainly do not help to consolidate peace and stability," he told the conference, organised by Al-Azhar, the world's foremost Sunni Islamic centre of learning. "It is essential that we spare no effort in eliminating situations of poverty and exploitation, where extremism more easily takes root, and in blocking the flow of money and weapons destined to those who provoke violence." Acts that do not promote peace are "a gift to the proponents of radicalism and violence", the pope said. Amid high security, the pontiff is meeting with Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, the Imam of the government-run Al-Azhar mosque and an Islamic philosophy professor, before meeting with Sisi and Pope Tawadros II, the head of Egypt's Coptic Church.

(25:20) Egypt has been under a state of emergency since two bombings in Coptic churches earlier this month that killed 45 people. All of the country's churches have been placed under additional protection because of the risk of another assault timed to coincide with Francis being in the country. The most recent attacks have been claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) group, which has warned of further attacks against Egypt's Coptic Christians and on the Vatican . Armoured cars have been stationed in front of the presidential palace and security men have been posted every hundred yards along a 20km stretch between the airport and central Cairo. The pope is also going to meet Coptic Pope Tawadros II. Egypt's Copts, who make up about 10 percent of the country's population of 92 million, are the Middle East's largest Christian minority and one of the oldest. The two men are due to walk together to the Coptic church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in the heart of Cairo, which was hit by a bomb attack in December claimed by ISIL that killed 29 people. The attack was the deadliest targeting the Coptic community since the 2011 suicide bombing that killed 23 people in Alexandria.

Egypt has seen a wave of attacks against Christians since 2013, when the military led by Sisi overthrew President Mohamed Morsi , the country's first democratically elected president. For decades, Christians have complained of discrimination, saying they are denied top jobs in many fields, including academia and the security forces. They have also accused the security forces of failing to do enough to protect them from "religious extremists", a complaint that has persisted under Sisi's rule.

RenderPagesVideo('4099694129001', 0, '100%', 473, 'vdoContainer'); Over the past month my team and I have followed the heroin corridor from colourful poppy fields in the remote mountains of southern Mexico to Martinsburg, West Virginia - one small American town ravaged by addiction and overdoses. What we saw was that on both sides of the border, the trade has resulted in death and misery. In Mexico that death is usually delivered at the end of a gun in regions ruled by drug gangs. More than 100,000 people have been killed or gone missing since Mexico launched its war against drug cartels in 2006. All drug-related violence of course isn’t directly tied to heroin. But according to Antonio Mazzitelli, chief of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Mexico, cartels are growing in strength as a result of a boom in heroin sales in the US. That strength allows them to rule with even more impunity in some parts of Mexico. Poppy farmers we spoke to told us they can’t negotiate with the middlemen who come to buy their raw opium paste. They likened any challenge to those men as suicidal. "That would be like putting a gun to my head," one farmer told us. According to many top US officials Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States [Julia Galiano-Rios/Al Jazeera] Death delivered by needle In the US, death is delivered by needle. According to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control, more than 8,200 people in the US died from heroin overdoses in 2013 - nearly three times as many as in 2010. For several years now, West Virginia has had the highest rate of deadly drug overdoses in the US - that’s all drugs, not just heroin. Heroin addiction took hold after a much larger wave of prescription pill addiction. According to the United Health Foundation, in 2014 about 31 out of every 100,000 people in the state died from drug overdoses. If you were to compare that to Mexico’s homicide rate of 22 murders per 100,000 people, living in West Virginia seems riskier than life south of the border. Berkeley county, which is home to Martinsburg, reported 36 deaths from heroin overdoses between 2007 and 2012, the highest for the whole state. We met several people in Martinsburg who knew people who had died from heroin overdoses, many more who've overdosed repeatedly and been lucky enough so far to survive. The day before we arrived a man died shooting up in a Wendy’s fast food restaurant bathroom. Kathy Stevens-Butts, the mother of a 23-year-old woman who died from a heroin overdose in November told us heroin is a "plague". "I don’t know what else to liken it to. People are just dropping dead left and right," she said. Poppy farmers say they would rather grow avocados and peaches, but the problem is they have no good roads to get their product to market [Julia Galiano-Rios/Al Jazeera] Guerrero State - Mexico’s most violent Farmers in the southwestern state of Guerrero are increasingly seeding fields of poppies to cash in on the boom in heroin consumption in the US. Throughout its history, Guerrero has been one of Mexico’s most violent states. Now it has the highest murder rate in Mexico. And much of that killing can be tied to organised crime and the drug trade. The case of 43 students who disappeared in the arms of local police illustrates just how lawless and violent Guerrero is. According to the government, the students were murdered by the area’s dominant gang, Guerreros Unidos, or Warriors United. Mexico’s attorney general said members of Warriors United killed the students and incinerated their bodies because they thought they were members of a rival gang. Whether you believe the government’s theory or not, the logic is: Protect your highly lucrative turf at any cost. The poppy fields we visited are just a few hours drive from where the students were last seen. Not only is Guerrero one of Mexico’s most violent states, it is also one of its poorest. According to a UN report more than half of Guerrero’s population are affected by extreme poverty. The state relies heavily on tourism. But its former jewel of a resort, Acapulco, is now one of the world’s most violent cities, famous for bridge hangings, beheadings and shootings as well as dazzling beaches. The state’s economy is in ruins, and some of the only decently paid steady work in Guerrero is with organised crime. In the mountains, poppy farmers tell you they would rather grow something else. Avocados, peaches - anything that could rival what they earn from poppies. But the problem is they have no good roads to get their product to market. Heroin paste is compact and portable. It doesn’t bruise going down a bumpy dirt road. But peaches and avocado do. For decades activists have pressured the government for services and roads. But the state remains a backwater. That neglect, they say, is what pushed them into the drug-growing business. Guerrero is not only one of Mexico’s most violent states, but also one of its poorest [Julia Galiano-Rios/Al Jazeera] American public health crisis Many also blame lack of opportunity in West Virginia for its high levels of addiction. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2009 West Virginia residents filled 19 painkiller prescriptions per capita - the highest in the US. Since then the government has cracked down on illegal pill dealing. As pill prices rose, Mexican cartels flooded the US market with cheap, high-grade heroin, to deadly effect. According to The Atlantic , painkiller overdoses have dropped slightly in West Virginia whereas heroin overdose deaths have tripled in the past five years. The problem is so bad in West Virginia and other states that authorities we spoke to all said the problem should be addressed as a public health crisis. One police officer who used to work on drugs and now investigates murders in West Virginia said, "I used to believe locking people up was the answer, but that has completely failed". Heroin dealers told one recovering addict we spoke to that Martinsburg was a "goldmine". He and other former users told us if you go to certain corners in nearby Baltimore, Maryland, with West Virginia plates on your car, dealers swarm you with free samples. The state is clearly known for its desperation and addiction. One image particularly stands out to me from our trip to West Virginia: That of a gleaming new neo-natal intensive care unit complete with several incubators. Helena Brady is the nursing director for the unit. It’s set up to help premature babies and other newborns struggling in their first weeks of life. Brady said usually more than half of the babies in the unit are addicted to heroin - because their mothers were heroin addicts. It can take months to wean the babies off the drug. When we asked Brady if she expects to see more heroin-addicted babies she said, "Yes, a tidal wave is coming."

A young boy harvests opium in Panjwai, Afghanistan [Steve Chao/Al Jazeera] Kabul, Afghanistan - They tell her not to come. They warn her she'll be killed. But Laila Haidari keeps returning to the same dingy, dangerous underpass, day after day. It's a scene of abject misery. The Pol-e-Sokhta bridge in Afghanistan's capital Kabul is home to thousands of heroin addicts. They cram together in this small space, living amid raw sewage and human faeces that covers the ground. Most Afghans watch this horrific scene from the safety of the bridge above, but Haidari ventures beneath. A social activist trying to help addicts get clean, she said she's been attacked twice - once so severely she was hospitalised. But Haidari is determined to reverse the toll illicit drugs is taking on her country. Afghan film-maker Laila Haidari helps heroin addicts and arranges for bodies to be taken away [Steve Chao/Al Jazeera] "They are human beings and I want to fight for them," Haidari said. "For as long as I'm alive… I will work to help people overcome their addiction." Her fight is at times overwhelming. Overdoses are common, and it is Haidari who arranges for the dead to be brought to the nearest street for collection by authorities. Sometimes, the bodies are left there for hours. Most of the heroin produced in Afghanistan is trafficked out of the country, accounting for 90 percent of the world's supply. But increasingly, more Afghans are falling prey to the drug. A new survey funded by the US Department of State, the results of which were provided exclusively to Al Jazeera, estimates there are an estimated 2.9 million drug users in the country - one of the highest per capita in the world. A group of Afghan men get high on heroin under a bridge in Kabul [Steve Chao/Al Jazeera] Ground zero In the southern countryside of Kandahar and Helmand, Afghanistan's poppy fields are thriving. Poppy produces opium, the main ingredient in heroin. Along the roadsides, large, dusty government billboards warn against growing the crop. But deeper into the countryside, authorities have little control - and little say on what farmers grow. Fazel Rehman, a tall, soft-spoken poppy farmer, said he relies on the crop to feed his family of 10. "Poppy guarantees cash in your hands. We make 10 times more with the drug than other crops," Rehman told Al Jazeera. "To be honest, I would prefer to grow something else," he said. "But government officials haven't helped us with alternatives. So what choice do I have?" Farmer Fazel Rehman said growing poppy is the only way to feed his family [Steve Chao/Al Jazeera] He alleged officials also profit from the trade, saying he paid local police hundreds of dollars recently to leave his fields alone. Poor farmers such as Rehman see the current fragile truce between the Afghan government and Taliban in the region as an opportunity to make up for lost time. For more than a decade, NATO troops fought a fierce ground war against the Taliban in these agricultural areas. Markets and crops were destroyed, leaving farmers with few ways to support their families. The US has pumped $7.6bn in counter-narcotics spending in to the country, but the results have been dismal. Since the 2001 US-led invasion, Afghanistan's drug production has exploded. Poppy cultivation hit 224,000 hectares in 2014 - a record high. Police commander Nasrullah Khan inspects a cache of seized opium and heroin [Steve Chao/Al Jazeera] Outmatched and outgunned Just 10km from Rehman's poppy farm, police commander Nasrullah Khan prepared his men for a dangerous raid. For someone given the daunting task of purging the region of opium poppy fields, he seemed resigned to his role. His squad is a ragtag bunch of regular cops, with some re assigned to drug duty just for the day. It's a risky task. Khan said his forces came under fire every time they tried to destroy poppy fields in 2014. "IEDs were exploding around us," Khan said of his last raid. "Many of my officers were injured or killed." Because of increasing attacks, police were only able to destroy nine of out of an estimated 5,000 hectares of poppy in the area last year. Afghan police look on as an angry farmer approaches them during an operation to destroy poppy fields [Steve Chao/Al Jazeera] Back in the capital, federal drug prosecutors face a similar uphill battle, but it's not for a want of funds. The US and the UK have spent billions to create a clandestine drug court aimed at prosecuting high-level drug traffic kers. Al Jazeera gained exclusive access to the court - the first time cameras were allowed inside. The location is secret and its staff are handpicked and often trained by foreigners. All this is supposed to ensure court officials are free from influence and intimidation. But Najla Temori, a prosecutor of eight years, said this is far from the reality. "We face extreme danger every day in our jobs," Temori told Al Jazeera. "Twice thugs working for drug lords showed up at my house." The court has jailed thousands of traffickers, but the real kingpins continue to elude authorities. Members of Afghanistan's counter-narcotics force say they face daily threats to their lives [Steve Chao/Al Jazeera] Pointing fingers In 2014, authorities did capture and jail Lal Jan, a trafficker who controlled much of the drug trade in southern Afghanistan. He was sentenced to 20 years in jail. But insiders say he bought his escape by paying off officials with millions of dollars in drug money. Today, he is nowhere to be found. Haroon Sherzad, the country's acting minister of counter-narcotics, admits corruption in the justice system is still a problem and cases such as Jan's harm Afghanistan's reputation and chances of securing international aid. A billboard warns farmers not to grow poppy [Steve Chao/Al Jazeera] Yet, in explaining why drug production is skyrocketing despite years of efforts and billions of dollars given to the cause, Sherzad pointed the finger back at the international community. "Their focus was only on terrorism and other sector development, but counter-narcotics was an isolated and marginalised agenda in their programme," Sherzad said. Hashim Wahdatyar, a representative for the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, said the Afghan government is equally at fault. After President Ashraf Ghani was elected last September, hopes were high that he would list eradicating drugs as a key government goal in his opening remarks. This was not to be. "Afghanistan has 22 national priorities, but counter-narcotics is none of them," said Wahdatyar. Meanwhile, the criminals are becoming bolder. One smuggle r, who asked to remain anonymous, said his gang makes up to $600,000 a year from the trade. "They'll never stop us," he said . "We've tasted the profits, so we'll never let go."

Ram Advani, seated in his bookshop in 2013, is considered by many to have been one of India's most experienced booksellers [Sonia Paul/Al Jazeera] On March 9, the bookstore on the corner of Lucknow's Art Deco Mayfair building was closed to its usual stream of visitors. Ram Advani, the beloved bookseller who ran the city ' s oldest independent bookshop, had died that morning at the age of 95. Advani, who has been lauded as one of the country ' s most experienced booksellers, established his shop in Lucknow, the capital of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, in 1948. The " Ram Advani Booksellers " founder was widely known for his soft demeanour, erudite knowledge and for embodying the cosmopolitan spirit of the city. He was an icon among both locals and foreigners, particularly scholars of South Asia, many of whom credit him for enabling their research. With news of his death, people in different corners of the world recalled the slight, charming man, his inviting bookstore and the fading history he represented. A family of booksellers Advani was born on October 12, 1920, in Karachi, to a Sindhi family of booksellers who owned shops throughout present-day Pakistan. The eldest of five children, he accompanied his father to Lucknow in 1928 so that his father, having heard that the British had settled in Lucknow, could open a bookshop that catered to their preferences. Advani spent his formative years in the city, studying and earning his master ' s degree from Lucknow University in March 1943. At the encouragement of an uncle, he went to Shimla, a hill station in northern India, where he worked at the Bishop Cotton School as a treasurer, part-time history teacher and coach of the school ' s cricket team. There, Advani was surrounded mostly by foreign teachers and Anglo-Indian students. " They made you feel comfortable, and yet, there was that patronising, or that tone, which sometimes hurt one, " he recalled of those pre-Partition years in a 2007 interview with the University of Leeds . " I was sensitive. I did feel hurt. And I felt, I can ' t stay here. " At the suggestion of another uncle, he visited one of his family ' s bookshops in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, in the summer of 1945, to test the bibliophile career path. His interactions with the booksellers and customers cemented his decision to become a bookseller. "They knew how to be kind without patronising, and that made me feel very much that there is something in bookselling that is worth thinking about," he told the Indian news channel NDTV in 2014. In 1945, his family opened a bookshop in Lahore and Advani was put in charge. But when the riots, tensions, and other distress of Partition erupted, he returned to Shimla by train, bearing witness to the bloodshed along the way. In Shimla, he opened a bookshop, but revenues weren ' t sufficient and so he made his way back to Lucknow in November 1947, just months after India and Pakistan were born as two separate nations. Soon after Independence, Ram Advani's bookstore opens Advani quickly secured property for a bookshop and opened it on February 15, 1948, in the heart of Lucknow - the Hazratganj neighbourhood. This was two weeks after its intended opening date, as the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi on January 30 pushed it back. The shop moved to its present-day location at Hazratganj's Mayfair building in 1951. Advani ' s bookstore became a hub of intellectual and community life in the neighborhood that, at the time, was also known as the place to see and be seen. " Ganjing ", the term for dressing up and ambling along the lanes of Hazratganj, was a hallmark of life in Lucknow, a city with a vivid, storied sense of self. It holds feverishly to its old-world charm of being the land of the Nawabs, the ancient Shia rulers of the region known for their extravagant ways and elegant lifestyles, and for being a place where different religious groups and communities are said to live in peace. Yet Lucknow as a centre of high academic culture didn ' t quite work out as planned, according to Rosie Llewellyn-Jones , a British historian of Lucknow who first met Advani in 1975 and has authored several books on the city. While a university had been established with high hopes in the 1920s, it went through rough patches in the 1970s and 1980s, she said, and so Advani ' s shop became a refuge. " Why Ram ' s shop and his acquaintances were so valuable is that you would meet intellectuals in the shop, and academics, " she says. " There wasn ' t anywhere else for them to go. " A bylane in Hazratganj, one of Lucknow's main shopping districts where Ram Advani's bookstore is located [Deepak Singh/Al Jazeera] A hub for scholars With its rich history as the centre of the former kingdom of Awadh and its political sensitivity within India, Lucknow was primed as a destination for scholars. But the way Advani positioned himself as a bookseller helped create a cascading effect for more people to come. He focused his inventory on English books, especially rare books that might otherwise be difficult to come by, and prided himself on being able to access them for customers. " He was the kind of bookseller who would look at the catalogues with the customers in mind, " says Advani ' s sister Mohini Mangalik, 91, adding that he used to study the way customers interacted with the books to best understand what might interest them. William Dalrymple, a historian, writer and co-founder of India ' s annual Jaipur Literature Festival, says Advani used to email him with book recommendations and about new arrivals. " He had a brilliant sense of what you were doing or wanted, so I ended up buying huge quantities of my books from Ram rather than from Amazon because he was better, " Dalrymple says. " Many scholars did what I did, buy most of our books about India via Ram. " Over the years, " it would have been somewhere between 800 and 1,000 scholars " that Advani was personally in touch with, according to his son, Rukun Advani. Among his most famous patrons was India ' s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru . Old-world charm Visitors could count on an intimate, welcoming experience at the bookshop reminiscent of an old-fashioned salon. Classical music often played in the background, as Advani was a fan. He made it a point to introduce visitors to each other. Well-read on both current affairs and scholarly materials, with a love for cricket, golf and whisky, he was willing to talk at length to anyone about any topic - that is, except for politics, which he felt might create strife in an otherwise tranquil environment. " In Lucknow, what we call tehzeeb , he was a big believer in all of that, " says Rahul Prakash, Advani ' s son-in-law, referring to the city ' s characterisation as mindful of etiquette. David Boyk, an urban historian and lecturer at UC Berkeley, who first met Advani while studying Urdu in Lucknow in 2006 and 2007, says the bookseller seemed nostalgic for times past - for what he considered a " quieter, saner, more dignified and respectful time. " He definitely talked about experiencing humiliations at the hands of the British. But he also, I think, missed the gentility, " Boyk says, referring to the ambiguous relationship many people of Advani ' s generation felt with the British. Advani ' s persona continued to amplify as other remnants of Lucknow ' s colonial past, including its British Council Library and a cinema that screened only English films, shut. The Bara Imambara complex, a shrine for Shia Muslims built in Lucknow, India in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. Many say Advani helped them discover the richness of the city [Sonia Paul/Al Jazeera] Enriching the city Scholars encouraged each other to visit him if they were to ever go to Lucknow, locals honoured him at events, and his bookshop became a Lonely Planet destination as well as a stopping point for different tour groups coming to the city. Books aside, to be in his presence and hear what he had to say was enough for some people. " As a child I was excited about what I could get my parents to buy me; as an adult I wanted to know what Mr Advani would tell me about, " says Vikram Singh Chauhan, a lawyer from Lucknow who received his first book from Advani ' s shop. It is almost universally acclaimed that Advani exemplified the best of Lucknow. It is also thanks to him that people know as much about Lucknow as they do, says Llewellyn-Jones . " People would go there, realise what a rich city it was, and start researching on it, " she says. " But without Ram ' s help, it would just be a provincial city. " That ' s especially true given the current reputation of the city and its state, according to Dalrymple. " I think UP [Uttar Pradesh] is quite a rough and tough place, and Lucknow is quite a different place from the Lucknow of the Nawabi tradition, " he says, referring to the gangs and criminal violence of the region. " To find a magical bookshop in the middle of the crumbling rough town that Lucknow is now is like finding an oasis in the middle of a desert. " Advani ' s death stirred the memories of those who knew him; newspapers and numerous remembrances online paid tribute to him. He was frail following the death of Sudershan, popularly known as Darshi, his wife of more than 60 years, in June last year. " She holds the key to my heart, " he told Outlook Magazine in 2013. After his wife died, his bookshop was the thing he looked forward to, his sister says, but he was no longer able to work after sustaining a hip injury in November. The bookshop closed the day Advani died and opened again for business the following day. His family says they ' d like to continue running it, although both his two children do not live in Lucknow. But the bookshop, synonymous with Advani ' s big personality, won ' t ever quite be the same, they acknowledge. " He was more into helping people, " says Radhika Prakash, Advani ' s daughter. " Matching a title with the type of person whom he thought you were. He was a different kind of bookseller. " SOURCE: Al Jazeera ABOUT THE AUTHOR Sonia Paul Arts & Culture India Asia History
The museum was completed in February 1959, about six years before Le Corbusier's death [Michael Penn/Al Jazeera] Tokyo, Japan - Adjacent to Tokyo's historic Ueno Station is a three-storey square building constructed of reinforced concrete. This grey and somewhat hulking structure might not initially command too much attention among the city's other sights but for the exposed columns on its first floor, propping up the rest of the building. The sign at the gate announces that this is the National Museum of Western Art - and since last July it is the only UNESCO World Heritage Site to be found in the greater Tokyo area, a region hosting a population of more than 35 million people. The crucial significance of this building is that it was built under the auspices of the renowned Swiss-born French architect Charles-Edouard Jeanneret, better known by his professional name Le Corbusier. The museum's initial construction took almost a year and was completed in February 1959, about six years before Le Corbusier's death. It was his only work in Japan , and indeed his only building to be found east of his much more ambitious and groundbreaking designs in Chandigarh, India. Tokyo's National Museum of Western Art was one of 17 Le Corbusier-related sites to receive the World Heritage designation last summer, with the committee justifying the awards by explaining that they "reflect the solutions that the Modern Movement sought to apply during the 20th century to the challenges of inventing new architectural techniques to respond to the needs of society. These masterpieces of creative genius also attest to the internationalisation of architectural practice across the planet". Challenging the Modern Indeed, what most defined Le Corbusier's long and varied career as an architect and urban planner were his attempts to grapple with modern, industrial society. He consistently sought to make a sharp break with the past and to create designs and structures in accordance with the new demands of modernity - or at least his own vision of what a future industrial world should look like. Le Corbusier was a painter as much as he was an architect, and he was often searching for simple, functional designs that could be effectively mass-produced and thus be made available to serve the material and environmental needs of ordinary families. On the other hand, few would argue that he always got it right. While his underlying aim may have been to improve the material lives of the many, he has also been criticised as having unwittingly helped legitimise the brutal, boxy architecture of the high-rise apartment buildings that grow like weeds across the urban landscape. By the time the National Museum of Western Art commission came to him in the mid-1950s, Le Corbusier was in the twilight of his career and among the most renowned living architects in France. However, even then he could still be controversial and full of surprises. The Japanese government was seeking the return from France of the important European art collection of the industrialist Kojiro Matsukata (a son of former Meiji-era Prime Minister Masayoshi Matsukata), which had been trapped there during World War II. France finally agreed to relinquish the Matsukata art collection, but stipulated that a French architect must be selected for the new museum. The museum is the only UNESCO World Heritage Site to be found in the Tokyo area. [Michael Penn/Al Jazeera] The best man for the job Le Corbusier was a natural choice, not only because of his top-level prestige at that time, but also owing to the fact that he had several talented Japanese disciples - Junzo Sakakura, Kunio Maekawa, and Takamasa Yoshizaka - who could translate his broad ideas into a concrete reality with a better knowledge of the local circumstances and building conditions of Tokyo. The basic plan was an elaboration of a concept by Le Corbusier which he called the "Museum of Unlimited Growth". He had first conceived this notion decades earlier, but now he finally had the opportunity to realise a structure that articulated one possible adaption. Shoichiro Sendai, of the Graduate School of Engineering at Hiroshima University, notes: "Le Corbusier only made the basic plans. The execution was the work of the Japanese architects who had experience in Atelier Le Corbusier. In this sense, the National Museum of Western Art was actually a collaboration. "Of course, the original idea itself was by Le Corbusier, but the building contains particular functions designed for the Japanese context," he said. Professor David Stewart of the Department of Architecture and Building Engineering at the Tokyo Institute of Technology additionally notes that Le Corbusier was not even on site for most of the construction period: "He only actually visited Japan when the building was nearly finished." An imperfect representation Beyond this, the building which exists today is an imperfect representation of what Le Corbusier himself had in mind for the completed development. "The entire project was never built. It included a whole area of buildings of which only the painting gallery exists," explains Stewart. Originally the complex was meant to include such elements as an outdoor theatre and a public plaza. The broad vision was that this area would become a "miracle box" at which the public could be treated to a series of wondrous and surprising experiences. Stewart believes that Le Corbusier himself would probably have been somewhat disappointed that the area surrounding the National Museum of Western Art wasn't developed according to his original and considerably more sweeping plans. Moreover, there has also been extensive rebuilding at the museum since it first opened its doors in 1959. The underground floors and the expanded use of artificial lighting may be perfectly well justified by practical considerations, but would not necessarily have met with the original architect's personal approval. Still, the great significance of this commission is that it provided Le Corbusier with the opportunity to work in collaboration with his main Japanese students, benefiting both him and them. With his death in August 1965, the National Museum of Western Art became Le Corbusier's only direct work in Japan, although he did continue to exercise a wider, indirect influence through his Japanese students and admirers. Not least among these was Kenzo Tange, architect of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum and later the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, both of which, in their own ways, exhibit a clear reliance on the French architect's inspiration.

Philip Riteman was just 13 when the Nazis forced him and his family on to a train bound for Auschwitz [Scott Munn/Al Jazeera] Philip Riteman was just 13 when the Nazis shoved him and his family on to a train bound for Auschwitz from the Pruzhany ghetto in Poland . At the time, he and his family had no idea they were being carted to their deaths. "Three o'clock in the morning somebody [yells] and I see the German sitting with a gun and screaming, yelling, 'Out, out you Jews!'" Riteman recalled. They walked to the railroad tracks and Riteman saw freight trains stretching as far as his eyes could see. Riteman, a Polish Jew, said about 100 people were crammed into the trains which measured roughly 8ft by 20ft. The Nazis told them it would be an hour's ride. "Two hours gone, three hours gone - all day on the train. [On] the train we shake. The train slow, slow, you hear rifle shooting, but you can't see it because you look to the boards. And we stay, all glued together. Could you picture this? Can you imagine? I wouldn't do this to animals." As the train clicked along the tracks on the seemingly endless ride, a man soon dropped dead at Riteman's feet - the first casualty of this tragic journey. "A fellow behind me, a tall fellow, he says, 'Maybe you can try shifting, move your feet, maybe one inch, everybody moves an inch, and see if we can put the dead body to the wall.' We did this." The train continued rolling through the countryside. For what felt like days, a young mother's baby began crying. Its screams still torment Riteman to this day. Then, it stopped. "The baby died in the mother's arms," said Riteman bitterly. "She was hysterical." Six or seven days passed. There was no, food, water, or bathrooms. "I peed every day in my pants. Everybody [defecates] in their pants and pees, and everybody screaming, crying - unbelievable they could do this to human beings." Then, one morning, they finally arrived at Auschwitz. Riteman was separated from his family, and it was the last time he would ever see them again. "In the afternoon, my parents already was gassed," he said, with tears in his eyes. "Trains after trains coming in. They gas them. Could you imagine? I couldn't believe it. I was there a month and I didn't believe they'd do this. I thought I was still going to see my parents. I will still see my sisters, my brothers. Then I found out. I see people going to the crematoriums, and they gassed 5,000, 10,000 at one time. It's very, very hard for me to talk about it." Riteman's entire family was exterminated by the Nazis. His father, mother, five brothers, two sisters, his grandparents, and nine uncles and aunts were annihilated in Auschwitz.

After being liberated by the Americans in 1945, he spent time in a displaced persons camp. He weighed just 34kg. Then, in 1946, he landed in Newfoundland, then pre-Confederation Canada . This is just one gruesome snapshot of the Holocaust , which claimed the lives of about six million Jews during World War II. More than a million Jews like Riteman were hauled off to Auschwitz but only a handful made it out alive. At least 960,000 perished there. According to The Blue Card , an international organisation that provides financial assistance and other resources to Holocaust survivors, there are an estimated 100,000 survivors still alive today, many of whom live in poverty. April 23 marked Israel's observance of Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day, a day which hangs heavy on the hearts of many survivors around the world. "I will never forgive, and I will never forget," said Fanny Starr, 95, another Polish Holocaust survivor who endured the terrors of Auschwitz. Starr, who now lives in Denver, Colorado, lost her mother, two of her siblings, and many other family members to the gas chambers of the German concentration camp. She remembers the atrocities well. Ashes of burnt bodies fell like snow from the Auschwitz crematoriums, she said. "That was such a heinous crime against humanity to try to annihilate our race," Starr added. "But thank God, they didn't succeed. Six million people lost. People who committed no crime, they killed nobody, without no reason, we were just slaughtered." Fanny Starr [Photo courtesy of the Starr family] READ MORE: A brief history of war and drugs - From Vikings to Nazis 'Stand up to hatred early on' With the tide of nationalist politics and xenophobia seemingly rising on both sides of the Atlantic, Starr said it's more important today than ever to commemorate the Holocaust so the world can be reminded of what can result when toxic ideologies grip entire countries and continents. "Something like the Holocaust just doesn't happen overnight," said Ken Jacobson , deputy national director of the Anti-Defamation League in New York. "It's related to a long history of anti-Semitism in Europe, over 2,000 years, which became deeply embedded in Western civilisation. That's why we commemorate the Holocaust, to symbolise that it just didn't happen, it took a period of evolution for it to happen, and that one has to stand up against hatred early on." On Tuesday, at the US Capitol in Washington DC, President Donald Trump commemorated Yom HaShoah with a sombre speech. "Those who deny the Holocaust are accomplice to this horrible evil," Trump said. "We will never, ever be silent in the face of evil again," he added. Despite Trump's remorseful speech, during and after his presidential campaign, countless synagogues, playgrounds, and public areas were vandalised with graffiti swastikas and phrases like "Heil Trump" and "Make America White Again". Although Trump has called for hate crimes being carried out in his name to stop, he was slow to denounce support from racist factions across the country, including David Duke , former leader of the Ku Klux Klan , and his populist rhetoric has also coaxed some of the radical right's ideologies to emerge from the shadows. "Some of the populism, [you could] call it nationalism," described Jacobson. "Some of it's coming from the right again, some is coming from the left. [It's] very disturbing because it has an anti-democratic feel, and it emboldens those people who engage in this invasive, discriminatory, Islamophobic, anti-Semitic behaviour." According to the Anti-Defamation League, anti-Semitic hate crimes against Jews, including assaults, vandalism, and harassment, rose by 34 percent in 2016. In the early months of 2017, these incidents are continuing to spike. "We know that 30 million Americans still have anti-Semitic attitudes," Jacobson added. "In the past, because of civil society, because of the mood of the country, very few of them ever would act out those attitudes. Because of the [current] atmosphere, some of it from the campaign, some of it from other kinds of issues as well, a sense of anxiety about the political world, about the economic world, about identity, has come together in a way that's emboldened a certain number of people to now act out their anti-Semitic attitudes in a way that they haven't for quite a while." The current political atmosphere in the US has emboldened Islamophobic and anti-Semitic groups, according to Ken Jacobson at the Anti-Defamation League [Tony Shi/Getty Images] WATCH: UpFront special - The rise of anti-Semitism Nationalist political climate Jews are the most targeted religious group for hate crimes in the US, a phenomenon that was prevalent in American society long before Trump's rise and nationalist politics shifted to the mainstream. In 2015, Jews were targeted twice as much as Muslims for religiously motivated hate crimes in the US. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which compiles an annual report of hate crimes based on data from nearly 15,000 law enforcement agencies, found that of 5,850 registered hate crimes in 2015, 1,354 were motivated by religious bias. Of those, 51.3 percent - or roughly 694 - of these were anti-Jewish hate crimes. "I definitely think [Trump's] rhetoric has emboldened people on the radical right," said Heidi Beirich , an researcher and expert on extremism and nativism at the Southern Poverty Law Centre (SPLC) in Montgomery, Alabama. Beirich told Al Jazeera that the SPLC collected data on about 1,800 hate crime-related incidents in the post-election period. She estimated that about one-fifth of those were carried out in Trump's name. "What happened is in the wake of the election we just saw [hate crimes] across the United States against Jews, but also against immigrants and also against Muslims, that were the major populations that he attacked during his campaign." Beirich added that xenophobic rhetoric targeting immigrants and particularly Muslims, shares "disturbing parallels" with the rise of European anti-Semitism, which often coincided with nationalism, during the 1930s and 1940s. She also noted that Britain , too, saw a skyrocketing of anti-Muslim crimes following Brexit , the country's referendum on leaving the European Union . "So, when Hitler rose to power it started with a wave of violence like this," Beirich added. She also explained that in today's political climate, it's critical to commemorate the Holocaust. "If everything goes completely to hell, you've got genocide, you demonise populations enough, that's where you are heading," Beirich said. "You don't want to start going down that road. And the Holocaust is just this horrific reminder of what can happen. That's when mass slaughter can occur. We shouldn't even be talking about this, that's why it is so tragic, you know, that we have to be keep reminding ourselves of the Holocaust. It's embarrassing." Riteman, 95, and his wife Dorothy [Scott Munn/Al Jazeera] READ MORE: Remembering Britain's other war veterans 'Make sure that doesn't happen again' For Riteman, the Polish Auschwtiz survivor, such reminders plague him daily. The black tattoo ink on Riteman's left arm - the numbers, 98706, his Auschwitz prisoner ID - are for ever etched there. Although the ink on his arm has faded, the horrific memories have not. The pain - and bitterness - from his time in Auschwitz still rings heavily in his voice. "That's got to be told to our children, our grandchildren, great, great, great grandchildren. So long as the world exists, they should make sure that doesn't happen to anybody. Period." Today, Riteman is 95. He's tired, and hard of hearing. Yet, he's still quite spry. At his quaint Canadian home in Halifax, Nova Scotia, which he shares with his 85-year-old wife Dorothy, whom he met in Montreal in 1947, Riteman stares off into the distance. For decades, he didn't speak about the horrors of the Holocaust but it's a subject he now discusses openly - and something he treats as a duty - largely, so history doesn't repeat itself. "You people are lucky," he said. "You're living in heaven. You don't even know it. I want you to wake up and make sure it doesn't happen again. That's the reason I'm speaking in schools, universities. Make sure [you] don't hate nobody, don't do no harm to anyone. Be a good person. Maybe we could make a better world to live for everybody."

UK Prime Minister Theresa May triggered Article 50 earlier today and officially started the process that will lead to Britain leaving the European Union . Now attention turns to what will happen next. Much of the analysis has so far been focused on the forthcoming negotiations with the EU, with the possibility of no EU trade deal seeming increasingly likely. But the real debate has been over what Britain's role in the world will be after Brexit . May has promised a "truly global Britain" outside the EU and some supporters of Brexit have framed the break from Brussels as an opportunity for Britain to strengthen its historical, imperial relationships. This is a deeply problematic and dangerous view. To become "truly global" Britain needs to shake off this imperial hangover. An imperial Brexit Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(4628884626001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_4628884626001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > WATCH: Britain's imperial past goes on display in London (2:09) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY As Twitter branded Wednesday, March 29 " Brexit Day ", historian David Starkey appeared on the BBC's Today Programme to compare Brexit to Henry VIII's historic break from Rome. Crucially, he argued that the Reformation presaged the "expansion of England" and suggested that Brexit may see another age of empire. Since the vote to leave the EU , visions of Britain's future relationship with the rest of the world has repeatedly invoked imperial motifs. From Theresa May's promise of a "red, white, and blue" Brexit to the suggestion that the Royal Yacht Britannia be recommissioned to facilitate trade deals, Britain's future has been presented as an opportunity to return to a glorious past. Most famously, or infamously, the International Trade Secretary Liam Fox's focus on deals with countries that once belonged to the British Empire has been labelled "Empire 2.0" by Whitehall officials. Dealing with an imperial past The specific focus of future trade relationships on Commonwealth nations raises a number of issues. One is the clear preference for the Anglosphere and the implied preference for linguistic and racial homogeneity. Australia has been one of the forerunners for a post-Brexit trade deal and public discussion of the Commonwealth tends to focus on New Zealand or Canada rather than Malawi or Malaysia. As Britain faces the reality of life outside the EU and looks to establish new, prosperous relationships with global partners, it needs to shake off its imperial hangover. While the former settler dominions of Australia, Canada and New Zealand might be more willing participants in a new imperial project, they are not major economic forces. To find trading partners that might realistically replace the EU, Britain will have to deal with nations that have a more critical view of its imperial past. Britain shares this problem of historical baggage with many of its European neighbours. However, the invocation of empire by leading Brexit supporters reflects an unapologetically positive view of imperial history. In recent years Germany has apologised to Namibia and the Netherlands has apologised to Indonesia for the excesses of empire. Similarly, French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron recently described France's colonial past as a "crime against humanity" in an interview with Algerian television. In Britain, there has been no comparable public statement of remorse or reconciliation. Truly global Britain Britain's overly positive view of its imperial history is likely to cause problems in negotiations with new trading partners. For example, the Indian politician Shashi Tharoor has warned that in India "Empire 2.0" would "go down like a lead balloon" and described British rule in India as "200 years of plunder and exploitation". To secure access to the growing Indian economy Britain must acknowledge that a return to its imperial dominance is neither realistic nor desirable. Similarly, the dominant global economic powers, the United States and China , have their own histories of violent encounters with the British Empire. Not only are these major international powers likely to be unimpressed by "Empire 2.0", but the power imbalance between the global leaders and the UK makes a mockery of Britain's imperial pretensions. OPINION: The need for a museum on British colonisation of India The transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong to China in 1997 and the subsequent failure of Britain to provide significant support to the 2014 "Umbrella Protests" is a good demonstration of Britain's inability to replicate its imperial influence in the modern world. Perhaps the most crucial imperial legacy is at home. The British public should not be misled with promises of imperial glory. Instead, it should be made clear that Britain will be making deals with equal partners rather than relying on old colonial possessions. As Britain faces the reality of life outside of the EU and looks to establish new, prosperous relationships with global partners, it needs to shake off its imperial hangover.

A demonstrator in a 'Make America Great Again' hat listens to speeches as 'white nationalists', white supremacists and 'alt-right' activists gather in Washington in June 2017 [Jim Bourg/Reuters] As the world has by now been made painfully aware, Donald Trump 's preeminent goal as president of the United States is to "make America great again". But for many students - not to mention victims - of international history, the burning question remains: when exactly was America great? Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5315332252001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5315332252001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > FEATURED DOCUMENTARY: The Big Picture - The People vs America (47:33) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY The answer is surely not to be found in the atomic bombs dropped on Japan in 1945, the lethal chemicals used to saturate Vietnam , or the unexploded munitions that continue to maim and kill people in Laos decades after the secret US war on that country. Nor, presumably, would Latin Americans slaughtered by US-backed dictators and death squads be able to provide many clues as to the whereabouts of America's historical "greatness". Ditto for Iraqis, Afghans, Yemenis and other civilian populations consistently over-represented in the US-inflicted "collateral damage" category. On the domestic front, too, the whole concept of greatness has been rather elusive - unless, of course, we take it to mean a centuries-long tradition of crushing Native Americans, blacks, and everyone else whose dignity can be comprehensively violated in the service of elite socioeconomic domination. Competing histories Moreover, America's ongoing prioritisation of the health of the arms industry, a pillar of the current capitalist system, occurs - naturally - at the expense of human wellbeing both at home and abroad. In his seminal work "A People's History of the United States" , the late American historian Howard Zinn noted one particularly gleeful period of Cold War military spending in which a certain Trident submarine - one of various "frightful and superfluous weapons … totally useless except in a nuclear war" - came with a $1.5bn price tag. OPINION: Trump's 'Muslim ban' is not an exception in US history This sum, Zinn reported, was " enough to finance a five-year program of child immunisation around the world against deadly diseases, and prevent five million deaths". But why let dying kids get in the way of US greatness? Alas, few observers are as meticulous as Zinn, who relentlessly connected the dots, exposing the economic foundations and functions of the more than a half-millennium of bloodshed, plunder, displacement, and exploitation that has characterised the American landscape since Christopher Columbus' so-called " discovery " of the place in 1492. In contrast, the official mass-marketed version of US history predictably whitewashes the American trajectory, converting potentially unpleasant memories - the wars on Native Americans and blacks, for example - into stand-alone tragedies and unfortunate episodes that in no way taint the moral integrity of the nation itself, which is instead cast as a pioneer in democracy, equality, human rights , and all that good stuff. One particularly wealthy character is threatening to 'make America great again'. But given that American "greatness" has for so long been tantamount to widespread oppression, we might be forgiven our pessimism. Toeing the line Obviously, it would be far easier to buy into the notion that the US now occupies an enlightened realm of post-nastiness if, you know, American cops didn't continue to murder innocent black people with impunity . It would also help if the American non-elite didn't continue to be generally asphyxiated by the very society decried by Zinn: One that is engineered to ensure that all men are not, in fact, created equal, particularly when it comes to the distribution of wealth. Fortunately for the powers that be, the US education system is essentially rigged to toe the official line. Schoolchildren are bombarded with myths of American exceptionalism aimed to counteract a physical reality of societal decay, while bellicose shenanigans abroad are presented as freedom and democracy promotion and the natural behaviour of great people. My own recollections of attending Catholic primary school in the US - aside from being taught that my dog was not going to heaven and that Saddam Hussein could send a missile to my classroom at any minute - include annual festivities surrounding everyone's favourite whitewash of genocide and land theft: Thanksgiving. Come mid-November, half the class would set about crafting Pilgrim hats, the other half would craft "Indian" headpieces, and then we'd all harmoniously draw turkeys together and consume pumpkin pie. Liberty and justice? Another highlight of the school years was the daily standing recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance to "one Nation under God … with liberty and justice for all". So much for the separation of church and state - or the fact that "liberty and justice" have never been "for all", being as they are totally irreconcilable with the obscene socioeconomic disparity that continues to prevail in the US. READ MORE: Know your history: Understanding racism in the US In August of last year, CNN Money announced that, according to a report by the Congressional Budget Office, "t he rich are still getting richer in the US, with the wealthiest 10 percent controlling three-quarters of all family wealth in the country." The article continued on to note that "the entire bottom half of the population" was left with "just 1 percent of the total pie". Now, of course, one particularly wealthy character is threatening to "make America great again". But given that American "greatness" has for so long been tantamount to widespread oppression, we might be forgiven our pessimism. And while much of America is consumed with the furore over " fake news ", much more of a ruckus could stand to be made over what amounts to America's fake history.

A face of Karl Marx is seen through a hole in a banner as people in Spain march to protest against the conservative government's tough labour reforms in 2012 [Alvaro Barrientos/AP] It is quite amazing that Karl Marx's Capital has survived and been continuously in print for the past century and a half. After all, this big, unwieldy book (more than 2000 pages of small print in three fat volumes) still has sections that are evidently incomplete. Even in the best translations, the writing is dense and difficult, constantly veering off into tangential points and pedantic debates with now unknown writers. The ideas are complex and cannot be understood quickly. In any case, the book aims to describe economic and social reality in 19th-century northwestern Europe - surely a context very different from our own. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5188920584001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5188920584001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > UPFRONT: Does income inequality help or hurt the US? (12:26) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY This is a book that has been pronounced dead or obsolete many times, but it keeps bouncing back, with the latest recovery in interest and sales just after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. So why do so many people all over the world still read (or try to read) Karl Marx's Capital today? Obviously, it must have something going for it - and, in fact, it does indeed still provide a useful framework for understanding the essential features of capitalism, no matter how different its contemporary manifestations may be. Consider only a few of these insights. First is the central point about capital: for Marx, it is not just a resource in itself, a simple factor of production analogous to land and labour, but an expression of very specific social relations of production. The social relation between employer and worker is what enables capitalist production to take place at all. It requires workers to be "free" in a double sense: "free" to sell their own labour power (not bound by other socioeconomic ties and constraints) and "free" of any ownership of the means of production, so that they have no choice but to sell their labour power for their own material survival. Even when matters appear to be more complex because of the emergence of subcontracting and the "gig economy", this underlying social relation is still critical. The concentration of ownership of the means of production in a few hands is effectively what enables capital to play its role in production. But this concentration was necessarily based on expropriation from those who previously possessed it, such as peasants and small artisans who could have produced on their own. This "primitive accumulation" has often been a violent process, but it can also occur - and still continues to occur - in other more complex ways, because of the uneven development of capitalism in different regions and in different sectors. OPINION: Why so many communist philosophers? A central, and still very powerful, concept is that of "commodity fetishism": the situation in which relations between people become mediated by relations between things: commodities and money. Commodities (goods and services produced for exchange) are not simply things or objects, because they possess both use value (meeting human needs or wants) and exchange value (as a thing that can be traded in return for something else). But value then gets seen as intrinsic to commodities rather than being the result of labour, and the exchange of commodities and market-based interaction are seen as the "natural" way of dealing with all objects, rather than as a historically specific set of social relations. Commodity fetishism is the illusion emerging from the centrality of private property in capitalism, which then determines not only how people work and interact, but also how they perceive reality and understand social change. More broadly, commodity fetishism is the illusion emerging from the centrality of private property in capitalism, which then determines not only how people work and interact, but also how they perceive reality and understand social change. The urge to acquisition, the obsession with material gratification of wants and the ordering of human well-being in terms of their ability to command different commodities, could all be described as forms of commodity fetishism. The obsession with GDP growth per se among policymakers and the general public is an extreme, but widespread, example of commodity fetishism today. Marx identified three "cardinal facts" of capitalist production: 1- Concentration of means of production in a few hands, whereby they cease to appear as the property of the immediate labourers and turn into social production capacities; 2- The organisation of labour into social labour: through cooperation, division of labour and the uniting of labour with the natural sciences; 3- The creation of the world market. The third feature is what we now call globalisation, and it is the natural result of the tendency of the system to spread and aggrandise itself - to destroy and incorporate earlier forms of production, and to transfigure and transform technology and institutions constantly. Capitalism is dynamic, constantly generating new types of production organisation and economic institutions: not just the factory system but more recent arrangements, financial institutions and structures, legal systems. The accumulation of capital generates higher productivity and transforms systems, but it is also associated with uneven development. Marx saw capitalism as being in a situation of continuous disequilibrium, because of this tendency of uneven development, which is not confined to a single arena, but characterises all social and economic relations. OPINION: Education or capital in the 21st century? Thus, there is an inherent tension between the expansion of the productive forces and the ability of the economic system to generate sufficient demand for the goods that are produced. There is disproportionality between the expansion of fixed and variable capital, which makes it more difficult to generate profits. There is disproportionality between sectors that emerges in the process of accumulation. There is geographically uneven development that simultaneously creates both "developed" and "underdeveloped" areas. This can be extended to explain imperialism, which can be understood as the struggle for control over economic territories of different kinds. And the imbalance between money as a medium of exchange and money as a measure of value gets amplified by the development of credit and finance, creating a higher tendency for crisis. The system generates many conflicts and contradictions, only some of which culminate in periodic crises. Since the basic dynamics of capital is simultaneously to aggrandise itself and impoverish other classes such as workers and peasants, within and across nations, it obviously generates class conflicts. But the system also generates intra-class conflict, pitting individual capital against other capitals and the individual worker against other workers. There is a Darwinian struggle for survival constantly at work, so individualism, conflict and competition become the driving forces of the system. Video // <![CDATA[ RenderGeneralBCVideo(5290523042001,0,0,330,186, "bcvid_5290523042001");brightcove.createExperiences(); // ]]]] > COUNTING THE COST: Global inequality: Bridging the gap (25:00) PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY But these also create what Marx called the anarchy of the market and the inevitable tendency towards crises. Overproduction in terms of the market (even when human needs of all the people in the society need not be satisfied) is a characteristic feature simply because of the way individual capitals operate in the drive to generate more profit. As a result, the process of accumulation is never smooth. Rather, it is uneven and punctuated by crises. Partly, this is the result of the very success of capitalism in delivering more economic growth and technological advance. These periodic crises are a way of resolving the contradictions inherent in the dynamics of capitalism, albeit in a sharp and possibly violent way. Because the underlying imbalance is typically one of overproduction (relative to demand, not need) such crises usually involve the destruction of a significant proportion of existing products and productive forces. For Marx, crises under capitalism are never purely "financial" or "monetary" - rather they reflect the real imbalances, disproportionalities and uneven development that are fundamental features of capitalist accumulation, even when they are expressed in financial terms. Marx did not talk about the rise to dominance of finance, but it can be anticipated from this progression, and financialisation also can be seen as an extension of capitalist processes into more and more areas of life. OPINION: Marx's last stand: Eastern Ukraine A fundamental feature of the capitalist system that Marx described, and one that has complex social and philosophical underpinnings, is alienation. This does not refer to an isolated experience of an individual person's feeling of estrangement from society or community, but to a generalised state of the broad mass of wage workers. Most simply put, it can be expressed as the loss of control by workers over their own work. This alienation of the workers means that they effectively cease to be autonomous human beings, because they cannot control their workplace, the products they produce, or even the way they relate to each other. Because this fundamentally defines their conditions of existence, this means that workers can never become autonomous and self-realised human and social beings under capitalism. This alienation, combined with commodity fetishism, creates a peculiar kind of unfreedom - which is often not even widely noticed, because individual emancipation appears to result from "universal saleability". So every living creature is effectively transformed into property and all social relations become transactionary. Of course, there is much about capitalism that is not captured in this book: the role of unpaid labour, especially in social reproduction and care work within households; the relationship of the economic system with the natural environment, and so on. Even so, the strong contemporary resonance of many of these concepts means that it is not surprising that people still look to this somewhat forbidding book for insights and understanding.

It was a moonless night in the countryside outside Granada, Spain in 1936. A coded execution order came down: "Give him coffee, lots of coffee!" Antonio Benavides, part of an irregular volunteer firing squad, obliged. "I gave that fat-head a shot in the head," he reportedly boasted later. This is one account of the death of the famed Spanish poet and playwright, Federico Garcia Lorca. There are many others. After all these years, the circumstances surrounding Lorca's death and the whereabouts of his remains continue to be one of the great mysteries of Spain's recent history. But after 81 long years can - will - the truth finally emerge? In response to a request by the Spanish Association for the Recuperation of Historical Memory (ARHM), an Argentinian judge, Maria Servini de Cubria, agreed to investigate the death of Lorca in August 2016. Lorca is the most famous face of a Spanish phenomenon little known in the rest of Europe : "desaparecidos" (disappeared). In 2014, an investigation by the United Nations Working Group for Human Rights revealed that between the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) and the end of Franco 's dictatorship (1939–1975 ), an estimated 114,226 Spaniards "disappeared". In a recent ranking of countries with the greatest number of disappeared, Franco's Spain came second only to Cambodia under Pol Pot. A woman walks past a memorial wall listing the names of Republicans who lost their lives during the Spanish Civil War at Oviedo's San Salvador cemetery [Eloy Alonso/AP] "[The Argentinian court's decision to investigate] is important for Spain, for the Spanish victims, because they have found a court that is listening to them," Lydia Vicente, executive director of Rights International Spain, told me. "Judge Servini de Cubria is applying international law and norms, which are disregarded by Spanish courts." The same Argentinian court has long been trying to help families of the Franco regime's victims to get closure. In 2013, hundreds of Spaniards turned to Cubria's court for help in uncovering crimes committed during the war and the subsequent dictatorship by using an international human rights law. Argentina is pinching holes in the dark closed ball of Spanish impunity. Lydia Vincente, In 2014, Judge Cubria ordered some of General Franco's former ministers to face justice as part of the investigation. She issued arrest and extradition warrants invoking "universal jurisdiction", a legal doctrine that authorises judges to try serious rights abuses committed in other countries. Spanish courts denied the warrants, but activists supporting the victims have nevertheless defined the move as "historic". Last year , thanks to the Argentinian court, the first-ever court order to exhume the bodies of Spanish civil war victims was issued and a mass grave in a cemetery outside Madrid containing 22 bodies was opened. And last month, in an emotional and widely publicised event, Ascension Medienta, a 91-year-old woman who had spent her life and savings searching for her father´s body, was finally able to bury him. "What joy, what joy! Now I can sleep peacefully," she exclaimed after receiving the news from her lawyer. "Argentina is pinching holes in the dark, closed ball of Spanish impunity," says Vincente. 81 years of impunity So why did the Spanish courts fail to prosecute these historic crimes, including Lorca's death, after so many years ? Because, in 1977, Spain passed an "Amnesty Law," ostensibly to protect its fledgling "democracy" after four decades of military dictatorship. This law prohibited individuals from being tried for crimes committed between 1936 and 1975. Of course, laws can be changed, if there is will. But the 39-year silence enforced by the military dictatorship eventually morphed into a collective "el pacto del olvido" (pact of forgetting) in Spain. A mnesty turned in to amnesia. In international law, Spain has come to be known as an example of the "Oblivion model": a memory law model based on the denial of any investigation, prosecution or reparation related to crimes committed during civil wars or other crucial historical events. The Monolith in memoriam of Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca is seen where he is believed to be buried at the village of Viznar, near of Granada, Spain [Sergio Torres/AP] The Argentinian court's investigation into Lorca's death is only the latest effort from outside to force Spain to act. In 2014, Pablo de Greiff, UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice and reparation, urged Mariano Rajoy's Conservative government to repeal the amnesty law and request courts to investigate crimes of Francoism. His call was left unanswered. "The UN said it clearly. Our democracy is robust and stable enough to do this, to heal our wounds. Because we are a democracy, we owe it to the victims, to all of us," says Vicente. Official admission of guilt In 1936, angered by the global interest in the death of Lo r ca, Franco dismissed any involvement in his assassination. "The writer died while mixing with rebels," he declared. Franco's assumption was that bad "rebels" were responsible for the death of the renowned poet. But the "rebels" he was referring to were, in fact, Republicans: supporters of the democratically elected government Franco's fascist forces finally succeeded in overthrowing. And far from being innocent, documents from a 1960's inquiry into Lorca's death, released in 2015, showed that Franco's administration had actually given official orders for his assassination. These documents are now with Servini de Cubria´s court in Argentina, according to Maximo Castex, one of the lawyers working on the case . As Ian Gibson, the prime biographer of Lorca who has seen the documents, recently wrote: "[These documents] demonstrate that it was not a street killing. He was taken out … to be murdered." A member of the Andalusian Geophysics Institute works with GPS equipment in the site where it is believed that the remains of Spanish writer Federico Garcia Lorca are buried, in Alfacar, near Granada [Pepe Marin/Reuters] These documents are the first ever evidence of Franco-era officials' involvement in Lorca's death. And by default, they prove the complicity of the regime in thousands of other disappearances. The importance of these documents and the investigation that is now taking place in Argentina is hard to overestimate. Enforced disappearance is a technique of terror , utilised by oppressive regimes to silence all opposition . And enforced disappearance is one of the most serious crimes that exist in criminal law: It starts with illegal detention accompanied by torture, leads to murder and concludes with the hiding of the body. Spain continues to delay or refuse requests by Argentine courts for documentation and extradition regarding forced disappearances . UN bodies have insisted that Spain must cooperate with Argentinian courts, pointing out that it must either extradite or prosecute - a basic principle under customary international humanitarian law. Yet, the government of Spain has done neither. OPINION: Searching for Garcia Lorca And now, with the change of government in Argentina from leftist Christina Fernandez Kirschner to centre-right Mauricio Macri, Argentinian courts - which once forcefully prosecuted and imprisoned Argentina´s own war criminals - have started to go quiet. A request to extradite Rodolfo Martin Villa, former Minister of the Interior under Franco, for homicide and crimes against humanity committed during the dictatorship - crimes which took place within the framework of a predetermined, systematic plan to eliminate all political opponents - was overturned only a few days ago in Buenos Aires. So, Spain's "desaparecidos" , including Lorca, may not be able to find justice in Argentina either. They were all Lorcas "Forgive me, my country! For my blood is now walking on your asphalt." These lines were written by Omar Hazek, a young Egyptian poet who came to prominence during the Arab uprising. Hazek dedicated this poem to two people: Khaled Saeed, a 28-year-old Egyptian man, whose death in police custody helped incite Egypt 's revolution , and Lorca. Hazek saw a n obvious link between Lorca and Saeed. Born 60 years apart, they were both innocent victims of brutal regimes. As someone who strongly identified with the oppressed of the world, Lorca remains a global icon. The discovery and proper burial of his body would capture the imagination of the world. And it could finally force Spain to confront its past. Lorca's body is believed to be buried somewhere along a road between two small villages near Granada. But along this road, and many other roads all over Spain, thousands of other bodies are buried, too. Nearby on a commemorative stone one can read: "They were all Lor cas. " And they all deserve justice. Gina Benevento is a former UN diplomat based in Jerusalem, now living and working in Madrid as a strategic communications consultant.

The history of British tea does not begin with some silly aristocratic marriage but with slavery, writes Dabashi [Getty] Recently my colleague Ilan Pappe and I were in Mexico City attending a conference on Palestine. In the course of the memorable few days we spent together catching up with the latest atrocities around the globe (in between our respective talks on the habitual shenanigans of the Zionist settler colony in Palestine), perhaps the most memorable phrase I remember is when Ilan cited our mutual friend the eminent Indian Marxist Aijaz Ahmed who had once told him "our singular historical failure as a nation was after 200 years of British colonialism we failed to teach them how to cook!" Soon after that memorable phrase I came across a typically blase BBC report headlined "The true story behind England's tea obsession", celebrating British and other European aristocracies, this time about the culinary calamity the British call "tea". WATCH: The Stream - The real cost of your cup of tea "Imagine the most English-English person you can think of," the piece begins , "Now I'm fairly certain that no matter what picture you just conjured up, that person comes complete with a stiff upper lip and a cup of tea in their hand". Clumsy grammar you might say, but the point is quite clear: the origin of tea might indeed be China , but it was Catherine of Braganza, daughter of Portugal's King John IV, who made tea popular in England. The entire article is a silly piece of British aristocratic memorabilia covering up a much nastier global history of British imperialism surrounding tea. Let's put it bluntly First of all, let's talk tea. The British do not know how to make tea. What they call "tea" is a travesty. There is no polite way of putting it. They just suck at making tea. Yes, they have built a splendid ceremony around what they call "the afternoon tea" but at the centre of the ritual is a nonsensical disaster they make with a beautiful and miraculous herb about which they do not understand the most basic facts. "There are few hours in life more agreeable," says Henry James famously in The Portrait of a Lady "than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea." Perhaps so - though the Japanese Tea Ceremony/The Way of Tea is infinitely more elegant and sublime. Be that as it may, the British mannerism around tea is most certainly not because of the wretchedly abused leaves they kill to nullity but because of the literary aura that Henry James and others have helped build around the ceremony. A proper cup of tea, as any civilised Indian, Iranian, Turk or central Asian can tell you, needs to be poured into a see-through cup, writes Dabashi [Getty images] To be sure, I am not the first person to point out the fact the British are a global embarrassment to the very idea of tea. "Tea is shit." This is not me. I will never say such a thing about any other people's culinary habits - no matter how atrocious. This is coming from writer Joel Golby, a proper Brit who has come out and declared what the British call tea "a national disgrace," confessing for the whole world to know that their "tea is shit." Further elaborating: We don't examine this enough in England. We just putter along, thinking tea is good; but it's not good. It's a lukewarm mug of leaf water, presented as a cure-all for life's ills. "Nice cup of tea," people say, when you've watched a vivid car accident or been given a terminal diagnosis, or gone for a walk and it's started raining. Whether the mafia has kidnapped you and made you kill a man with a gun to win your freedom or if you've done quite badly in an exam, someone will say: "Let me get you a nice cup of tea." But what is the problem, where did the British go wrong with their tasteless abuse of tea? Oh, Brother let me count the ways! Tea, dear friends, is a miraculous potion and if brewed to perfection it is composed on the physiognomy of the human face - and thus made to yield its God-given properties it will entice three of our most precious five senses. Following the order of the human face, a perfectly brewed tea begins with the gift of sight in our eyes on the top of our face designed to see, coming down to the nose in the middle to smell the aroma and concluding with the lips and the mouth where our sense of taste informs the treasure house of our palate. I have known since I was a toddler accompanying my late mother to Hajj Abduh's grocery store in Ahvaz, may they both rest in peace, that no tea on this earthly abode has these three qualities of colour, aroma and taste together and therefore a good tea is a composite tea, judiciously made of at least three different kinds of teas. Towards a post-colonial theory of tea Let me be more specific: imagine a beautiful cup of tea. What is the first thing you notice about that cup of tea: Of course its splendidly ruby colour. That is the first law of tea that the British egregiously violate by drinking their tea in those silly cups that are not see-through. A proper cup of tea, as any civilised Indian, Iranian, Turk or central Asian can tell you, needs to be poured into a see-through cup. You start enjoying your tea by first looking at it, "drinking", as it were, its miraculously crimson colour. Milk rudely destroys the delicately combined comportment of colour, aroma and taste of any decent tea all at the same time, writes Dabashi [Getty] Then as you bring the see-through cup closer to your face to drink it rises the aroma (nose) and finally the taste (mouth) of the tea. Here comes the next calamity of the British, which is flooding their wretched tea with milk! What a total horror! Milk rudely destroys the delicately combined comportment of colour, aroma and taste of any decent tea all at the same time. The few precious words that my generous Al Jazeera editors afford me do not allow me to talk in detail about the most precious of all moments when you actually drink the tea in the company of a small piece of sugar cube you strategically place in the corner of your mouth for what we call dishlameh or ghand-pahlo , the exact antithesis of the criminal atrocity of the British saturating their tea with merciless spoons of sugar, poisoning the wretched tea they drink. The entire joy of drinking tea, as any Turk, Russian, Iranian, or Central Asian teahouse master will tell you is the exquisite delicacy of negotiating a peaceful, cooperative, and delightful coexistence between the bitterness of tea and the sweetness of sugar, diplomatically negotiated inside your mouth. Can you even imagine Donald Trump , Benjamin Netanyahu , or Theresa May trying to grasp that sublime sense of peaceful coexistence between tea and a sugar cube conversing in your mouth? Of course not. Ask them what is dishlameh - it's Greek to them. The colonial colouring of tea But "what went wrong" - as the notorious Zionist Orientalist Bernard Lewis would say. How did the British end up with their miserable cup of tea? The history of British tea does not begin with some silly aristocratic marriage but with slavery. "How did tea emerge as Britain's hot beverage of choice" an acute observer has asked recently on NPR , to which she has offered the apt observation: "Tea met sugar, forming a power couple that altered the course of history. It was a marriage shaped by fashion, health fads and global economics. And the growing taste for sweetened tea also helped fuel one of the worst blights on human history: the slave trade." When American colonies began their revolt against the British, they called their initial uprising the "Tea Party", for disguised as Native Americans, they threw an entire shipment of tea sent to American colonies by the notorious East India Company into Boston Harbor. But this very American revolution would itself degenerate into the genocide of those very Native Americans and an even more murderous chapter in African slavery. I am not the first person to point out the fact the British are a global embarrassment to the very idea of tea, writes Dabashi [Getty] The selfsame East India Company whose tea was thrown into Boston harbour used to buy tea from China for import with the money they made by their illegal trading in opium they grew in India . The British thus aggressively turned the Chinese into drug addicts by the abused labour of their colonies in India. Just imagine the depth of bastardy! What a plague, what a criminal calamity beyond words has British colonialism been to the world. When the Chinese tried to stop these illegal smuggling, Great Britain went to war with China in their so-called "Opium Wars". Historians of tea tell us : "The rise of tea and sugar as a power duo was a boon for British government coffers. By the mid-1700s, tea imports accounted for one-tenth of overall tax income". The same goes for sugar: "According to one analysis ... in the 1760s, the annual duties on sugar imports were 'enough to pay to maintain all ships in the navy ... Those tea-and-sugar monies helped supply the British navy with better foodstuffs ... and that navy was key to spreading British might across the globe. It's this dominance of the British navy that allows Britain to become the major colonial power in the 19th century." What was the cost of this horrid British "cup of tea"? That cost will have to be measured in human misery. "This fad for tea came in just as sugar was under attack and had started to fall out of favour. By creating a new and lasting use for this sweetener, tea helped buoy demand for sugar from the West Indies. And indeed, it continued to support the expansion of slavery there." After all these criminal atrocities around the world - stealing, pillaging, trading in slaves, mass murdering people to rob them of their natural resources - are you surprised at what the British have ended up with? Drinking that tea is an act of redemptive suffering, a just punishment for what the British have done to the world at large. Every time they sip from that accursed cup they are paying penance for the terror they have visited upon this earth.

The two relics found in a Cairo mud pit are thought to represent pharaohs from the 19th dynasty [Khaled Desouki/AFP] Archaeologists have found two Pharaonic statues dating back more than 3,000 years in a muddy pit in a Cairo suburb. The relics were found in Mattarya district, a site of the pharaonic capital of Heliopolis, one of the oldest cities of ancient Egypt . Today, the area is a sprawl of working and middle-class districts in northeastern Cairo. The statues, discovered on Thursday on wasteland between crumbling apartment blocks, are thought to represent pharaohs from the 19th dynasty, which ruled from 1314 to 1200 BCE.

Egyptian officials hope the discoveries will help boost the declining tourism industry [Khaled Desouki/AFP] Egypt has unearthed an ancient burial site replete with at least 17 mostly intact mummies. It is the latest in a string of discoveries that the country's antiquities minister described as a helping hand for its struggling tourism sector. The necropolis, uncovered eight metres below ground in Minya, a province about 250km south of Cairo, contained limestone and clay sarcophagi, animal coffins and papyrus inscribed with Demotic script. The burial chamber was first detected last year by a team of Cairo University students using radar technology. Archaeologists believe there are as many as 32 mummies in the recently discovered necropolis [Mohamed Abd El Ghany/Reuters] The mummies have not yet been dated but are believed from Egypt's Greco-Roman period, a roughly 600-year span that followed the country's conquest by Alexander the Great in 332 BC, according to Mohamed Hamza, dean of archaeology at Cairo University in charge of the excavations. Salah el-Kholi, a Cairo University egyptology professor who led the mission, said as many as 32 mummies may be in the chamber, including mummies of women, children and infants. "The discovery is still at its beginning," Khaled el-Enany, the antiquities minister, told reporters on Saturday. 'Historic year' Egypt is hoping recent discoveries will brighten its image abroad and revive interest among travellers who once flocked to its iconic pharaonic temples and pyramids, but have shunned the country since its 2011 political uprising. "2017 has been a historic year for archaeological discoveries. It's as if it's a message from our ancestors who are lending us a hand to help bring tourists back," el-Enany said. The mummies are believed to be from Egypt's Greco-Roman period that followed the country's conquest by Alexander the Great [Mohamed Abd El Ghany/Reuters] Archaeologists across the country have excavated a slew of relics in recent months. On Wednesday, the Ministry of Antiquities announced it had uncovered what is believed to be the 3,700-year-old burial chamber of a pharaoh's daughter. In March, pharaonic statues, dating back 3,700 years, were discovered in a muddy pit in a suburb of Cairo. Archaeologists have also found 12 cemeteries that are believed to be about 3,500 years old.

Figures from 2016 are not yet available. The tourism sector, a crucial source of hard currency for Egypt, has struggled to regain ground amid a growing number of attacks in recent years.
