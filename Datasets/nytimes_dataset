At Least 6 Reported Dead as Truck Careens Down Bike Path in Manhattan At least six people were killed when a man drove a pickup truck as many as 20 blocks down a bike path next to the Hudson River in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday afternoon before he jumped out with fake guns and was shot by police officers, the authorities said.The police did not immediately call it a terrorist attack. But two law enforcement officials said that after the attacker got out of the truck, he was heard yelling, “Allahu Akbar.” (Arabic for “God is great.”)The motorist, driving south down the path in a Home Depot rental truck, hit numerous people as nearby Stuyvesant High School was letting out for the day, officials said. At least 15 people were injured.“He jumped out of the truck with a pellet gun, yelled, ‘Allahu Akbar,’ and the First Precinct lit him up,” a law enforcement official said.Witnesses described gunshots ringing out, people scrambling for cover and a street strewn with bodies and crumpled bicycles.The driver, who was shot several times, was being treated at a nearby hospital. He had crashed the truck into a school bus. It was unclear if anyone was on the bus. The police said they were not looking for additional suspectsA large section of the West Side Highway was closed for the investigation as hundreds of officers, including the bomb squad, responded to the scene. The truck came to a rest near Chambers Street, facing eastbound.Students at Stuyvesant High School reported that they saw a man shooting from a pickup truck, and then saw the truck turn and strike a school bus.Ramon Cruz, 27, said the driver appeared injured. Then Mr. Cruz said he heard someone yell, “He’s got a gun, run, run!”Several nearby buildings, including Stuyvesant, were placed on lockdown.
Trump Belittles George Papadopoulos as ‘Low Level’ Adviser WASHINGTON — President Trump on Tuesday tried to diminish the significance of a former foreign policy adviser who admitted to lying to the F.B.I. about how, during last year’s presidential campaign, he sought to meet with Russians offering “dirt” on Hillary Clinton based on purloined emails.In his first comment on this aspect of the case being developed by the special counsel investigation, Mr. Trump did not deny that the foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, worked to collaborate with Russia. He simply brushed off his significance and focused on the fact that Mr. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. to cover up the contacts with Russia.“Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.As for the indictment of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, the president repeated that the crimes alleged took place outside the context of the election contest.As he has repeatedly in recent days, Mr. Trump sought to turn attention to Democrats, pointing to the resignation of Tony Podesta, the powerhouse Democratic lobbyist who also faces scrutiny by Mr. Mueller and whose brother, John D. Podesta, was Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman.“The biggest story yesterday, the one that has the Dems in a dither, is Podesta running from his firm,” Mr. Trump wrote. “What he know about Crooked Dems is earth shattering. He and his brother could Drain The Swamp, which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled. Fake News weak!”Mr. Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, were charged in a 12-count indictment with a series of money laundering, tax evasion and foreign lobbying crimes stemming from work for pro-Russian political leaders in Ukraine. While the crimes alleged began years before Mr. Trump’s campaign, the indictment asserted that Mr. Manafort’s scheme to defraud continued through last year until early this year.Mr. Papadopoulos was named by Mr. Trump in March 2016 as one of five foreign policy advisers. While the president and his team now seek to minimize Mr. Papadopoulos’s importance, at the time Mr. Trump described him in flattering terms. “He’s an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy,” he told The Washington Post.According to a statement of offense signed as part of his guilty plea, Mr. Papadopoulos admitted that he spent months last year cultivating contacts in an effort to arrange meetings between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russian government officials.Mr. Papadopoulos said a London-based professor with extensive Russian contacts introduced him to a woman described as “Putin’s niece” and told him the Russians had “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton based on “thousands of emails” of hers. (The woman was not actually related to President Vladimir V. Putin.)The professor, identified on Monday by a Senate aide as Joseph Mifsud, told Mr. Papadopoulos about the emails in April 2016, three months before WikiLeaks released nearly 20,000 hacked Democratic emails. Mr. Papadopoulos kept senior campaign officials informed about his efforts and they encouraged him but made clear they wanted to keep some distance publicly. “It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal,” a top campaign official wrote in an email at the time.Mr. Papadopoulos was not charged with any crime for making those efforts but instead pleaded guilty to lying to F.B.I. agents about the matter. He was arrested secretly in late July and has been cooperating ever since with the team of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.“George was a low-level volunteer who might have attended a meeting of the foreign policy advisory team, the one meeting that took place but he was not a person who was involved with the day-to-day operations of the campaign, or a person who I recall interacting with on a regular basis at all,” Corey Lewandowski, who ran the campaign before Mr. Manafort, said on the “Today” show on NBC on Tuesday.Mr. Lewandowski said he did not learn about the hacked Democratic emails until they became public. “To the best of my knowledge, absolutely not,” he said. “When I found out about that, I found out about it through public press reports.” He added that he has not spoken with the F.B.I. but would be “happy to do that unequivocally.”Mr. Papadopoulos’s efforts are the second known effort by a member of Mr. Trump’s team to obtain damaging information about Mrs. Clinton from the Russians. Several weeks after the meeting where Mr. Papadopoulos learned about the Clinton emails, Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Manafort and Jared Kushner, the future president’s son-in-law, met with a Russian lawyer after being promised incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton from the Russian government.They said later that the meeting did not yield such information, but the president has defended their decision to take the meeting as a routine opposition research. The original statement to The New York Times by Donald Trump Jr. describing the meeting, crafted with the participation of the president, omitted the promise of damaging information. Mr. Mueller is now looking into that statement.In Moscow’s initial reaction to Mr. Mueller’s indictments, Russian state-run news media and government representatives on Tuesday emphasized that the accusations laid out against Mr. Manafort did not mention Russia. Instead, media reports highlighted that he was accused for his actions in Ukraine. But his work in Ukraine was for the pro-Russian party of President Viktor F. Yanukovych, who was driven out of office by street protests in 2014.Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, called all accusations of Russia’s involvement in last year’s election “laughable, unqualified, groundless and unsubstantiated.”“From what we have read in the media and seen in the statements by participants of this process, so far Russia was not mentioned in any way in the accusations, other countries were,” Mr. Peskov said at his regular news briefing.“Moscow has never felt guilty to feel vindicated now,” Mr. Peskov said. “We were always puzzled about these groundless and unsubstantiated accusations of Russia’s alleged involvement in American elections,” he said. “We have resolutely denied them from the beginning and we deny them now.”American social media companies told Congress on Monday that Russia was prolific in its efforts to reach American voters last year to sow discord. Russian agents published inflammatory posts that reached 126 million users on Facebook, published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded over 1,000 videos to Google’s YouTube service, according to prepared remarks obtained by The Times.
Mueller’s First Indictments Send a Message to Trump WASHINGTON — Shortly after his former campaign chairman marched into an F.B.I. office to face criminal charges on Monday, President Trump took to Twitter to dismiss their relevance: “There is NO COLLUSION!”Yet even as his message went out to more than 41 million followers, news emerged that the authorities were unsealing another case that described how a young foreign policy adviser spent months seeking to connect Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russians offering “dirt” on Hillary Clinton.The first charges filed by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, did not implicate Mr. Trump but collectively amounted to a political body blow to a president who has spent months insisting that Mr. Mueller’s investigation was nothing more than a “witch hunt” based on a “hoax” invented by Democrats and the news media.The indictment of Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, suggested that the president’s top lieutenant for part of last year was a highly paid agent for pro-Russian foreign interests. And the guilty plea extracted from George Papadopoulos, the foreign policy adviser, confirmed the second known attempt by Mr. Trump’s team to tap Moscow for damaging information on Mrs. Clinton, coming months before his son Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer for the same purpose.The legal action propelled the special counsel investigation into a new and more dangerous phase for Mr. Trump, who had hoped to spend this week focused on his appointment of a new Federal Reserve chairman, the introduction of his tax-cutting legislation and the start of a 12-day trip to Asia.“It’s obviously a big-deal day. These are big-deal developments,” said John Q. Barrett, who served as associate independent counsel during the Iran-contra investigation.Inside the White House, the mood changed drastically throughout the morning. Although Mr. Manafort was the first president’s former campaign chief indicted since John N. Mitchell during Watergate, aides to Mr. Trump felt momentarily relieved that it had largely tracked their expectations and did not include any surprise allegations involving the campaign.But then, just as Mr. Trump tweeted that the charges involved actions that took place “before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign,” the news about Mr. Papadopoulos stunned and alarmed White House aides.Mr. Trump said nothing more publicly through the day and left it to his advisers to argue that the cases did not impugn him because Mr. Manafort’s actions were unrelated to his campaign service while Mr. Papadopoulos was just a volunteer whose efforts to set up meetings with higher-ranking officials were unrealized and who pleaded guilty to lying to F.B.I. agents, not to illegal campaign activity.“Today’s announcement has nothing to do with the president, has nothing to do with the president’s campaign or campaign activity,” said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. She added, “We’ve been saying from Day 1 there has been no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, and nothing in the indictment today changes that at all.”Jay Sekulow, a private lawyer for Mr. Trump, said the president and his legal team were not worried about the indictments. “No, not concerned,” Mr. Sekulow said on CNN. “I’m completely convinced, as I was from the outset, that not only was there no Russian collusion, there was no obstruction.” He added, “I’m not concerned about this at all, and no one else is either.”But lawyers and former prosecutors said Mr. Papadopoulos’s admissions and the previously reported meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. already undercut such denials.“Collusion is what Papadopoulos did. Collusion is what Trump Jr. and others in that meeting did,” Mr. Barrett said. “It’s meeting and discussing and seeing what common interests they can advance for each other.”Mr. Mueller’s action also made it harder for Mr. Trump to brush off the investigation and blame Democrats. “After Mr. Trump whipped up a tweet storm of suspicion about Mueller this weekend, he really now has no place to go with this attack,” said Robert F. Bauer, a White House counsel under President Barack Obama. “Mueller’s first charge is beyond any potential claim of ‘politics’ or ‘stretching’ that the president might wish to bring against him and his office.”The gravity of the threat may yet tempt Mr. Trump to take action to short-circuit the investigation, such as firing Mr. Mueller or pardoning Mr. Manafort or others. Conservative activists said Monday that Mr. Mueller should be pressed to resign because the charges against Mr. Manafort were not directly related to the campaign and therefore outside his prosecutorial mandate.Roger J. Stone Jr., a sometimes adviser to the president, told The Daily Caller, a conservative website, that the president should not fire Mr. Mueller but could accomplish the same outcome by directing the Justice Department to investigate a deal consummated when Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state giving Russian interests a share of the American uranium market.Because Mr. Mueller was the F.B.I. director at the time, he could come under scrutiny and therefore could no longer conduct the Russia investigation because of a conflict of interest, Mr. Stone argued. That, he said, was Mr. Trump’s “only chance for survival.”Both Ms. Sanders and Mr. Sekulow disputed suggestions that Mr. Trump might seek to fire Mr. Mueller. “There is no intention or plan to make any changes in regards to the special counsel,” Ms. Sanders said.The two also played down the possibility that Mr. Trump might pardon Mr. Manafort or others caught in the investigation. “I haven’t had a conversation with the president about pardons or pardoning individuals,” Mr. Sekulow said. Ms. Sanders likewise said that she had not spoken with the president about the possibility of pardons.In the past, the president has signaled that he might dismiss Mr. Mueller if the special counsel exceeded what Mr. Trump considers the bounds of his investigation. Mr. Trump has also publicly noted that he has the “complete power to pardon” relatives, aides and possibly even himself in response to the special counsel investigation.Democrats warned Mr. Trump on Monday not to impede Mr. Mueller’s investigation.“The president must not, under any circumstances, interfere with the special counsel’s work in any way,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader. “If he does so, Congress must respond swiftly, unequivocally and in a bipartisan way to ensure that the investigation continues.”Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said the indictment showed that Mr. Mueller was “doing his job” and that the process was working. “I’ll continue to support Bob Mueller as he follows the facts — his independence must remain sacrosanct,” she said.With the indictments, Mr. Mueller made clear that he was not to be underestimated. In one court document, his team used two words to describe Mr. Papadopoulos that might send a chill down the spines of some in Mr. Trump’s circle: “proactive cooperator.” Mr. Papadopoulos has been cooperating with prosecutors for three months, and his statement refers to several other campaign advisers he consulted as he reached out to Russian officials.Moreover, former prosecutors said the charges against Mr. Manafort and Rick Gates, Mr. Manafort’s longtime associate and also a Trump campaign adviser, were so serious that they might be an attempt to scare one or both into cooperating. A White House lawyer said last week that the president has nothing to fear if Mr. Manafort does talk with investigators, but Mr. Mueller and his team of prosecutors appear intent on finding that out themselves.“They’ve done phenomenal work, they’ve done it quickly, they’ve done it ruthlessly, and they’ve done it efficiently,” said Solomon L. Wisenberg, who was the deputy independent counsel during the investigation that led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton on charges of lying under oath about his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. “They’re sending a message: ‘We’re here to stay; don’t mess with us.’”
Paul Manafort’s Ambition Set the Stage for His Downfall WASHINGTON — In February 2016, after decades of lucrative paydays from foreign clients, Paul Manafort found himself at an inflection point. He was starting to give up hope of collecting millions of dollars owed to him by a Russian-aligned Ukrainian political party, and was straining to help his son-in-law salvage bad real estate investments. And he was also itching for one last shot on the American political stage.Over coffee at the Montage Beverly Hills hotel with an old friend, Thomas J. Barrack Jr., Mr. Manafort pursued an opportunity that he thought could solve his problems — joining Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign. And Mr. Barrack, one of Mr. Trump’s closest advisers, agreed to help make that happen.By the end of March, Mr. Manafort was on board, and in May, he was promoted to campaign chairman and chief strategist. Under Mr. Manafort’s direction, Mr. Trump secured the nomination, rallied much of the Republican Party establishment behind him and set the strategy that would take him to the White House. But instead of being a crowning achievement, the job that Mr. Manafort thought would turbocharge his consulting business set the stage for his downfall.Although Mr. Manafort was forced out of the Trump campaign less than three months before Election Day, his suddenly high profile set off increased scrutiny of his foreign consulting work by congressional and law enforcement investigators. The investigations have left Mr. Manafort, 68, owing millions of dollars to his lawyers, according to people familiar with his defense, and led some friends and business partners to distance themselves from him.And on Monday, the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, charged Mr. Manafort and his longtime deputy, Rick Gates, with violating lobbying, tax and banking laws in an effort to hide more than $75 million in income from their work in Ukrainian politics. The charges stem from work performed by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates from at least 2006 to 2015 for Russia-aligned Ukrainian politicians and parties, including the one led by the former Ukrainian president Viktor F. Yanukovych.“He could have kept running campaigns for the Yanukovychs of the world, and nobody would have cared,” said Hector T. Hoyos, one of Mr. Manafort’s closest friends and business partners. “But he took on the Trump campaign because he believed that the country was going down the wrong path, and he wanted to make a difference,” Mr. Hoyos said of Mr. Manafort, who is the godfather of Mr. Hoyos’s daughter.Had things not gone south, Mr. Hoyos said, “it would have been a huge business windfall for Paul.”“When you’re a kingmaker,” he said, “everyone wants to get close to you. That wasn’t the main reason that he got involved and decided to run the campaign, but that was in the back of his mind.”Nonetheless, Mr. Manafort “is not regretful of joining the Trump campaign,” said Mr. Hoyos, who spoke with his friend on Saturday. “He is regretful of doing the work he did in Ukraine.”Mr. Manafort first made his name in politics as a swashbuckling young Republican operative on the presidential campaigns of Gerald R. Ford and Ronald Reagan. But his work outside of electoral politics is where he really made his mark — and his fortune.He and two young colleagues from Mr. Reagan’s campaigns — Charles R. Black Jr. and Roger J. Stone Jr. — formed the core of a new breed of consulting and lobbying outfit that parlayed campaign-forged connections into big contracts from American businesses and foreign interests seeking to curry favor with the Reagan administration.In this shadowy world of international political consulting, Mr. Manafort, Mr. Gates and other Americans have earned vast sums working for clients tainted by corruption or authoritarianism or whose interests sometimes do not align with those of the United States, including Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and Mobutu Sese Seko of the Democratic Republic of Congo.For much of the last decade, Mr. Manafort’s work focused on Ukraine. He is credited with resurrecting the career of Mr. Yanukovych, and selling him to the West as a pragmatic leader who could bring the country into the European Union. But Mr. Yanukovych’s government crumbled in 2014 when he fled to Russia after his security forces clamped down violently on street protests over his government’s corruption and pivot toward Moscow.Even after Mr. Yanukovych fled, Mr. Manafort continued consulting for a Russia-friendly party called Opposition Bloc, which emerged from the ashes of Mr. Yanukovych’s government. Around the same time, Mr. Manafort began taking out loans on properties that Monday’s indictment alleges were purchased using money laundered through overseas accounts from his Ukraine work. He appears to have used at least some of the money to try to salvage real estate investments spearheaded by his son-in-law Jeffrey Yohai.“Paul had used the bulk of his cash to bail out the situation that his son-in-law created, so he had to borrow a lot against his properties,” Mr. Hoyos said.Nonetheless, Mr. Manafort seemed eager to return to the bright glare of the American political spotlight — even if it meant working for Mr. Trump for free, as he promised Mr. Trump in a memo delivered to the candidate’s family by Mr. Barrack.In the memo pitching his services to Mr. Trump, Mr. Manafort cited as selling points the fact that he owned an apartment in Trump Tower in Manhattan, where the campaign was headquartered, and his lobbying firm’s work for Mr. Trump in the 1990s, when it pushed to change the flight path of planes flying over Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla.And Mr. Manafort cast his international work as a strength, while spinning his two-decade absence from American politics as proof that he would “not bring any Washington baggage” to a campaign that was channeling anti-establishment fervor.Mr. Trump and Mr. Manafort quickly developed a rapport on the campaign trail. Mr. Trump and his family came to view the veteran operative as a valuable resource on a wide range of subjects on a campaign that had been run to that point by younger, less experienced operatives.For his part, Mr. Manafort relished being back in the white-hot center of American politics, according to his associates. But it was not long before he was engaged in a bitter power struggle with Mr. Trump’s first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Within a month of Mr. Manafort’s arrival, Mr. Trump elevated him above Mr. Lewandowski, who was later fired, giving Mr. Manafort authority to hire his own team and increase the notoriously frugal campaign’s spending on advertising and field organizing.Mr. Manafort brought on a number of his former associates in senior roles. Some — such as Mr. Gates, the operative Michael Caputo and the pollster Tony Fabrizio — also had experience working in Ukraine or other former Soviet states, and have since drawn scrutiny from the news media or from congressional and law enforcement investigators examining Russia connections.But things quickly went south for Mr. Manafort when news outlets began investigating his work and associations in Ukraine.When The New York Times published an exposé revealing that a ledger from Mr. Yanukovych’s party listed $12.7 million in off-books cash payments earmarked for Mr. Manafort’s company, Mr. Manafort argued to others in campaign leadership that the story was ginned up by allies of Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, and would blow over.Some campaign officials wanted to keep Mr. Manafort on board, but Stephen K. Bannon, who had recently been brought on as the campaign’s chief executive officer, told Mr. Manafort “this is bad,” and told Mr. Trump “that guy has to go.”Within days of the article — as well as contemporaneous exposés by other news outlets on Mr. Manafort’s activities and associates in Ukraine — Mr. Manafort was forced off the campaign.Mr. Manafort continued talking strategy with top campaign officials through Election Day, though, according to campaign officials. And, in the days before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, he called Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, to repudiate a dossier of memos written by a former British intelligence officer that mentioned him.The dossier alleged that Mr. Manafort managed “a well-developed conspiracy of cooperation” between the Trump campaign “and the Russian leadership,” and that Mr. Yanukovych had informed President Vladimir V. Putin that he ordered “substantial kickback payments” to Mr. Manafort.Those claims were “garbage,” Mr. Manafort told Mr. Priebus, according to someone familiar with the call.Yet even as the investigations of his activities heated up, Mr. Manafort continued to solicit international business. In recent months, associates say, he traveled to Ecuador; Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates; and Iraqi Kurdistan, among other places, and did little to discourage the perception that clients and potential clients could stand to benefit from his connections to Mr. Trump.Some clients, such as the allies of the leader of Iraq’s Kurdish region who hired Mr. Manafort to help administer and promote a referendum on Kurdish independence from Iraq, were not dissuaded by the investigations and his sudden notoriety.But after it was revealed that Mr. Mueller’s agents had executed a pre-dawn raid on Mr. Manafort’s home in July in Alexandria, Va., he became toxic to prospective business partners, according to Mr. Hoyos.“People were hesitant to be exposed to the fallout that was happening around Paul,” Mr. Hoyos said. “They didn’t want that to tarnish their image in the United States and around the world.”Mr. Hoyos said he had brought Mr. Manafort into a number of business ventures, including with a Chinese construction billionaire and a Chinese government-owned investment fund, but he informed Mr. Manafort in recent weeks that he needed to end their business relationship.“He was really, really sad, but he understood,” Mr. Hoyos said. “He apologized to me, and said, ‘I’m sorry that I created all these problems for you.’”The last months have also strained Mr. Manafort’s family. His older daughter has filed divorce from Mr. Yohai, while his younger daughter was questioned by a potential employer about whether the payments from Ukraine could be traced back to her, though she ultimately was hired.Mr. Hoyos said that Mr. Manafort’s daughters and their mother, Kathleen Manafort, who has been married to Mr. Manafort for nearly 40 years, are rallying behind him.“They want their father to be around when their kids grow up,” Mr. Hoyos said, “and that is very much in doubt.”
Under Mueller Scrutiny, Democratic Donor Tony Podesta Resigns From Lobbying Firm WASHINGTON — Tony Podesta, a prominent lobbyist and Democratic donor who has come under scrutiny from the escalating special counsel investigation, stepped down on Monday from the firm he co-founded, according to people familiar with the firm.The firm, the Podesta Group, has lost clients as it has been increasingly drawn into the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. On Monday, the Podesta Group and another company with which it had worked, Mercury Public Affairs, were referenced — though not by name — in an indictment of two former Trump campaign officials, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates.No charges have been brought against Mr. Podesta or officials from the Podesta Group or Mercury. But both firms have been subpoenaed for records and testimony about their work on behalf of a client referred to them in 2012 by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates, the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, a nonprofit group based in Brussels.The work for the European Center, which ended in 2014, was cited in the indictment on Monday as part of a “scheme” by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates to gain support in Washington for their longtime client, the pro-Russian leader Viktor F. Yanukovych, a former president of Ukraine, while evading disclosure requirements for foreign lobbying.Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates were charged with violating tax, banking and foreign lobbying laws in an effort to hide more than $75 million in income from their work in Ukrainian politics.The indictment was the subject of intense interest on K Street, where the Justice Department’s enforcement of the foreign lobbying requirements under the Foreign Agents Registration Act is widely seen as toothless. The charges against Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates that are related to the act, coming as powerful members of Congress are demanding more enforcement of the law, were seen by some as a shot across the bow of Washington lobbyists.Mr. Podesta announced his departure at a staff meeting on Monday. He is the brother of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign chairman John Podesta, who co-founded the firm. Tony Podesta has become the target of attacks from conservatives looking to shift attention away from Mr. Mueller’s scrutiny of President Trump’s campaign team.A person familiar with Mr. Podesta’s remarks at Monday’s staff meeting said he cited attacks from Fox News and the conservative media as making it “impossible to run a public affairs shop.” That person was not authorized to publicly discuss the internal meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity.A partner at the firm, who also did not want to be identified discussing delicate internal affairs, said that even before Mr. Podesta announced his departure, some senior partners were trying to convince clients to remain with them as they worked to reintroduce the company with branding that would not include Mr. Podesta’s name. The partner added that the effort had been fueled partly by Mr. Podesta’s aggressive efforts to defend himself against coverage by the conservative news media on the special counsel’s scrutiny of the Podesta Group.The firm has been among Washington’s highest grossing lobbying shops for years. Mr. Podesta’s resignation was first reported by Politico on Monday afternoon.Mr. Podesta’s lawyer on Monday sent a cease-and-desist letter to a Fox News host over his  claims on air that Mr. Podesta and his brother, John Podesta, worked closely with Mr. Manafort on behalf of Russia. The host, Tucker Carlson, said that the Podesta brothers and Mr. Manafort were the “central figures” in Mr. Mueller’s investigation.Mr. Podesta’s lawyer, Geoffrey R. Garinther, wrote to Mr. Carlson on Monday that his “false and defamatory statements have caused damage and injury to the reputation of Mr. Podesta and the Podesta Group.”The indictment on Monday did not name the Podesta Group or Mercury, instead referring to them as “two Washington, D.C., firms” that were recruited by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates “to lobby in the United States on behalf of Yanukovych, the Party of Regions, and the government of Ukraine.”Mr. Podesta and a spokesman for his firm did not respond to requests for comment.Michael McKeon, a partner at Mercury, said in a statement that the firm “takes its obligations to follow all laws, rules and regulations very seriously” and “has and will continue to fully cooperate with the Office of the Special Counsel in its investigation.”The companies were paid more than $1.1 million each, according to lobbying filings, to try to rally support among American policymakers and opinion leaders for Mr. Yanukovych, and to quell concerns about his leadership and his government’s jailing of a political rival.Neither firm initially registered with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires firms that lobby or conduct public relations for foreign individuals, companies, governments and political parties to reveal detailed information about their work.The Podesta Group and Mercury said they relied on assurances provided by the nonprofit group that it was neither funded nor controlled by any foreign government or party.But both firms were compelled this year to belatedly — and, in the case of Mercury, begrudgingly — register under the act, after their activities came under scrutiny from the Justice Department.In his statement, Mr. McKeon said Mercury followed the advice of legal counsel in its disclosure of its relationship with the European Center and noted that it registered the relationship under less detailed congressional lobbying disclosure rules. The Podesta Group also reported its relationship with the European Center under those disclosure rules.
Trump Campaign Got Early Word Russia Had Democrats’ Emails WASHINGTON — The guilty plea of a 30-year-old campaign aide — so green that he listed Model United Nations in his qualifications — shifted the narrative on Monday of the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia: Court documents revealed that Russian officials alerted the campaign, through an intermediary in April 2016, that they possessed thousands of Democratic emails and other “dirt” on Hillary Clinton.That was two months before the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee was publicly revealed and the stolen emails began to appear online. The new court filings provided the first clear evidence that Trump campaign aides had early knowledge that Russia had stolen confidential documents on Mrs. Clinton and the committee, a tempting trove in a close presidential contest.By the time of a crucial meeting in June of last year, when Donald Trump Jr. and other senior Trump campaign officials met with a Russian lawyer offering damaging information on Mrs. Clinton, some may have known for weeks that Russia had material likely obtained by illegal hacking, the new documents suggested. The disclosures added to the evidence pointing to attempts at collaboration between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, but they appeared to fall short of proof that they conspired in the hacking or other illegal acts.The improbable figure at the center of the new information was a “foreign policy adviser” to Mr. Trump, George Papadopoulos. It was Mr. Papadopoulos, one of three men whose charges were announced on Monday, who appears to have been the first campaign aide to learn about the Russian hacking of Democratic targets.A crucial detail is still missing: Whether and when Mr. Papadopoulos told senior Trump campaign officials about Russia’s possession of hacked emails. And it appears that the young aide’s quest for a deeper connection with Russian officials, while he aggressively pursued it, led nowhere.Mr. Papadopoulos repeatedly promoted the idea of a “history making” meeting between Mr. Trump and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president. Senior campaign officials, however, said that Mr. Trump should not make the trip and leave it to someone “low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal,’’ according to an email cited in court documents.Mr. Papadopoulos then proposed that he himself, perhaps with another campaign official, travel to Moscow to meet with the Russians.“The trip proposed by defendant PAPADOPOULOS did not take place,” prosecutors wrote.To grasp the significance of Monday’s developments, it helps to recall exactly how the Russian attack unfolded.In September 2015, the F.B.I. made its first call to the Democratic National Committee to report evidence of Russian hackers inside the committee’s network. But for seven months, the word never got beyond an I.T. contractor, and the hackers apparently had the run of confidential emails and other files.During that time, Mr. Trump was pressed to assemble a team of foreign policy advisers, a difficult task because he was shunned by many Republicans who had served in earlier administrations. In early March, Mr. Papadopoulos, who had been helping the beleaguered campaign of Dr. Ben Carson, offered his services to the Trump campaign.Around March 6, documents say, a campaign supervisor – identified by a former Trump adviser as Sam Clovis – told Mr. Papadopoulos, then living in London, that “a principal foreign policy focus of the campaign was an improved relationship with Russia.”A week later, traveling in Italy, Mr. Papadopoulos encountered a London-based professor of international relations, Joseph Mifsud, who claimed to have “substantial connections with Russian government officials.” (The court documents do not name Mr. Mifsud, but a Senate aide briefed on the case identified him as the professor in question.)Unimpressed by Mr. Papadopoulos at first, Mr. Mifsud became far more interested when he learned that the young traveler was working for the Trump campaign. The two men met again in London on March 24, when the professor introduced Mr. Papadopoulos to a Russian woman he said was a relative of Mr. Putin with close ties to senior Russian officials.The same week, Mr. Trump, visiting The Washington Post, was pressed to name his foreign policy team. He read out five names, most of them with modest or nonexistent public profiles – including Mr. Papadopoulos. Mr. Papadopoulos began emailing campaign officials about his new contacts with his “good friend” Mr. Mifsud and the Russian woman, whom he incorrectly believed was Mr. Putin’s niece, and the possibility of a Trump-Putin meeting.On March 31, back in Washington, Mr. Papadopoulos met Mr. Trump for the first time at a gathering of his new foreign policy team at the candidate’s Washington hotel. According to the former Trump adviser who was there, and who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid offending former colleagues, Mr. Papadopoulos spoke for a few minutes about his Russian contacts and the prospects for a meeting with the Russian president.But several people in the room began to raise questions about the wisdom of a meeting with Mr. Putin, noting that Russia was under sanctions from the United States. Jeff Sessions, now attorney general and then a senator from Alabama who was counseling Mr. Trump on national security, “shut George down,” the adviser said. “He said, ‘We’re not going to do it’ and he added, ‘I’d prefer that nobody speak about this again.’”But Mr. Papadopoulos was not deterred, the documents say, and he continued to communicate with Mr. Mifsud and the Russian woman about more contacts. The Russian woman wrote on April 11, “we are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump.” Mr. Mifsud introduced Mr. Papadopoulos over email to a Moscow contact who said he had connections to the Russian foreign ministry. They spoke repeatedly over Skype about a possible Moscow trip, the documents say.On April 26 came a crucial meeting. At breakfast at a London hotel, Mr. Mifsud told Mr. Papadopoulos that he had just returned from Moscow, where he had “learned that the Russians had obtained ‘dirt’ on then-candidate Clinton.” Mr. Mifsud said he had been told the Russians had “thousands of emails.”On May 4, the Russian contact with ties to the foreign ministry wrote to Mr. Papadopoulos and Mr. Mifsud, saying ministry officials were “open for cooperation.” Mr. Papadopoulos forwarded the message to a senior campaign official, asking whether the contacts were “something we want to move forward with.”The court documents describe in detail how Mr. Papadopoulos continued to report to senior campaign officials on his efforts to arrange meetings with Russian officials, which The Washington Post reported on in August. But the documents do not say explicitly whether, and to whom, he passed on his most explosive discovery – that the Russians had what they considered compromising emails on Mr. Trump’s opponent.J.D. Gordon, a former Pentagon official who worked for the Trump campaign as a national security adviser and helped arrange the March 31 foreign policy meeting, said he had known nothing about Mr. Papadopoulos’ discovery that Russia had obtained Democratic emails or of his prolonged pursuit of meetings with Russians.“I was surprised to learn what George Papadopoulos was up to during the campaign,” Mr. Gordon said in a text message. “He obviously went to great lengths to go around me and Senator Sessions.”Mr. Gordon said that such end-runs around normal channels are common in presidential campaigns. “It’s very hard to know what every single person is doing, especially since some folks deliberately go around the chain of command,” he said. “But George Papadopoulos obviously represents an extreme case.”Prosecutors may have deliberately left salient details out of the documents filed in court to protect the continuing investigation. But what they did say portrays Mr. Papadopoulos as continuing for months to arrange meetings with Russian officials. As late as August 2016, Mr. Papadopoulos was advised by a campaign official, apparently Mr. Clovis, to travel to Moscow “if it is feasible.”Instead of opening a new era in relations with Russia, Mr. Papadopoulos found himself caught up in the investigation of the Russian interference in the American election. The documents accuse him of lying to F.B.I. agents in two interviews, first on Jan. 27 and then on Feb. 16, when he “reiterated his purported willingness to cooperate with the F.B.I.’s investigation,” according to an affidavit filed by Robert M. Gibbs, an F.B.I. agent investigating the case.On Feb. 17, the agent wrote, Mr. Papadopoulos shut down the Facebook account he had used since 2005, including to exchange messages with the intermediaries for Russia. Prosecutors considered that to be obstruction of justice, and it became part of the case that concluded Oct. 5 when Mr. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to make a false statement to the F.B.I., which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.
Five Key Points From the Indictment of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates WASHINGTON — President Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, and Mr. Manafort’s former business associate Rick Gates were indicted on Monday. The men were charged with 12 counts related to money laundering, tax evasion and foreign lobbying.We read through the 31-page indictment. Here are the highlights:According to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates worked as unregistered agents providing political consulting and lobbying work in Ukraine between at least 2006 and 2015. The men worked in various capacities with Viktor F. Yanukovych, the onetime Ukrainian president and a pro-Russia politician.The job was lucrative, generating tens of millions of dollars that the men attempted to hide from American tax collectors and the public in a series of foreign companies and bank accounts, the indictment said.Mr. Mueller’s team found that more than $75 million passed through offshore accounts, and that Mr. Manafort laundered more than $18 million to pay for real estate, luxury goods and other services in the United States. Mr. Gates transferred more than $3 million from offshore accounts, court documents show.Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates were legally required to report their work for and payment from the Ukrainians to the United States. They did not, the documents show.After their work was disclosed in news reports in August 2016, when Mr. Manafort was still working for the Trump campaign, he and Mr. Gates “developed a false and misleading cover story” to distance themselves from Ukraine, according to federal prosecutors.The reports prompted the Justice Department to ask the men if they had ever worked as agents of a foreign power. They repeatedly said no, lying to federal agents, according to the indictment.Conspicuously absent from the charging documents against Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates: any mention of campaign-related interaction between the two men and Russia or between the Trump campaign and Russia. American spy agencies have concluded that Russia acted to help Mr. Trump’s candidacy during the election, and part of Mr. Mueller’s task is to investigate whether the campaign coordinated with them.However, in a separate case on Monday, a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trump’s campaign, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about a contact with a professor with ties to Kremlin officials. The plea represents the most explicit evidence connecting the Trump campaign to the Russian election efforts.Mr. Manafort in particular appears not to have been shy about using the money, wiring payments for clothing, cars, real estate and other luxury items directly from the foreign accounts to vendors, prosecutors wrote.Between 2008 and 2014, Mr. Manafort spent $849,215 at a men’s clothing store in New York and between 2008 and 2012, an additional $520,440 at a clothing store in Beverly Hills. He spent $934,350 at an antique rugs store in Alexandria, Va., where Mr. Manafort owns a home, between 2008 and 2010.In 2012 alone, Mr. Manafort spent about $225,000 on three Range Rovers and a Mercedes-Benz.And between 2008 and 2014, he poured money into a home in the Hamptons. Documents show Mr. Manafort paid a home improvement company on the Long Island enclave $5.4 million during that time and paid two landscaping firms $800,000.Mr. Mueller’s team appears to have carefully examined Mr. Manafort’s financial transactions — and no dealing was too small.In one case, in 2012, they found Mr. Manafort, through an LLC, paid $3 million in cash for a Brooklyn brownstone. Mr. Manafort then took out a $5 million loan for construction to convert the property into a single-family home. Instead of using the loan only for construction, though, documents show Mr. Manafort used the funds to pay off the mortgage on another apartment and make a down payment on another property in California.
A Lot Happened in the Russia Investigation on Monday. Here’s a Wrap-Up. WASHINGTON — Monday brought a dizzying series of developments in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 elections. Here’s a look at the day’s news, and what it might mean.• Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, was indicted on charges that he funneled millions of dollars through overseas shell companies and used the money to buy luxury cars, real estate, antiques and expensive suits.• Also indicted was a longtime associate of Mr. Manafort’s, Rick Gates.• Both men appeared in federal court in Washington and pleaded not guilty.• Documents were unsealed revealing that a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trump during the campaign, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I.• According to those documents, a professor with close ties to the Russian government told Mr. Papadopoulos in April 2016 that Moscow had thousands of emails that contained “dirt” on Hillary Clinton.• Google, Facebook and Twitter revealed new information that underlines the breadth of the Kremlin’s efforts to sow political discord using American technology platforms.• Tony Podesta — a major Democratic donor, lobbyist and brother of Mrs. Clinton’s 2016 campaign chairman, John D. Podesta — stepped down from his firm as he came under scrutiny for past work with Mr. Manafort.Without mentioning Mr. Trump or his campaign, the indictment focuses on Mr. Manafort’s lobbying work between 2006 and 2015 for Viktor F. Yanukovych, the onetime president of Ukraine and pro-Russia politician. Prosecutors said Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates schemed to hide money received for that work from tax collectors and the public. Mr. Manafort is also facing investigations by state and local authorities in New York.Here are some of the key points in the indictment, or you can read the 31-page document yourself.Mr. Manafort got his start in politics on the presidential campaigns of Gerald R. Ford and Ronald Reagan and made his fortune outside of electoral politics in lobbying. His work on the Trump campaign, rather than being a crowning achievement, instead commenced a series of events that would set the stage for his downfall. And  Mr. Gates, a longtime protégé of Mr. Manafort’s who was also charged, found himself deeply entangled in the Russia inquiry.The plea of Mr. Papadopoulos, a young foreign policy consultant whom Mr. Trump once praised as an “excellent guy,” shifted the narrative of the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia, revealing that Russian officials alerted the campaign, through an intermediary in April 2016, that they possessed thousands of Democratic emails and other “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton.According to the plea documents, Mr. Papadopoulos repeatedly tried to set up a meeting between campaign officials and the Russian government.The White House said that the indictments had nothing to do with Mr. Trump or his election campaign and instead sought to refocus attention on Democrats and their actions during the race. Shortly after the charges were announced, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter: “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????” In a second tweet, minutes later, he added, “....Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”But despite a White House response at times peppered with misleading and obfuscating claims, Monday’s developments propelled the investigation into a new and more dangerous phase for Mr. Trump and amounted to a political body blow to a president who has spent months insisting that the investigation was nothing more than a “witch hunt” based on a “hoax.”The special counsel leading the investigation, Robert S. Mueller III, was assigned in May to look into whether anyone close to Mr. Trump participated in a Russian government effort to influence last year’s presidential election. Monday’s indictments indicate that Mr. Mueller has taken an expansive view of his mandate.Here’s a closer look at several current and former associates of the president who have been linked to Russia.In our roundup of opinions from around the web, conservative writers mostly seemed to focus on the fact that the charges against Mr. Manafort didn’t implicate Mr. Trump, while liberal writers zeroed in on Mr. Papadopoulos’s plea.And our coverage of the indictment drew a flurry of reaction from New York Times readers, with more than 2,200 comments in the first three hours after it was published. Read what some of them had to say.
Tech Executives Are Testifying on Capitol Hill About Russian Election Interference • Facebook, Google and Twitter arrived on Capitol Hill for two days of marathon hearings that started on Tuesday afternoon with the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on crime and terrorism.• Top executives for the social media giants are being grilled by lawmakers investigating Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election, including how the online platforms were used to spread misinformation and propaganda.• Ahead of the hearings, all three companies announced on Monday that the number of Russian-linked accounts on their sites were higher than previously disclosed. Facebook said agents using those accounts disseminated information that reached 126 million users.Here is the latest:“How did Facebook, which prides itself on being able to process billions of data points and instantly transform them in the personal connections with its user, somehow not make the connection that electoral ads, paid for in rubles, were coming from Russia?” Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, demanded of Facebook’s general counsel.—Nicholas FandosIn a heated exchange, Mr. Franken asked Facebook to reject political ad purchases in foreign currencies.But Colin Stretch, Facebook’s general counsel, hemmed, saying the rejection of a foreign currency for political ad placements wouldn’t solve the problem of foreign interference.“The reason I’m hesitating on foreign currency is it’s relatively easy for bad actors to switch currencies,” Mr. Stretch said. “So it’s a signal but not enough.”That response didn’t satisfy Mr. Franken, who interrupted with exasperation.“My goal is for you to think through this stuff a little bit better,” Mr. Franken said, raising his voice.— Cecilia KangWhen his turn came for questioning, Senator Ted Cruz, a staunch conservative from Texas, pushed the conversation toward a very different concern: Tech companies putting a “thumb on the scale” in the country’s political debate.Mr. Cruz ticked through studies and examples suggesting a left-leaning bias on the platforms, but he began with one that was personal. A study of how Google served stories about political candidates, he said, showed that users searching for Democrats were more likely to see positive stories than those searching for Republicans, including Mr. Cruz.“The prospect of Silicon Valley companies actively censoring speech, or the news content, is troubling to anyone who cares about a democratic process with a robust first amendment,” Mr. Cruz said.The executives assured Mr. Cruz that they were taking steps to train employees to counteract any distortion of the political discourse online.“Free expression and free speech are at the core of the Twitter mission and we do everything we can do enable that,” Mr. Edgett said.—Nicholas FandosRepublicans lawmakers stressed that Russian agents did not favor a particular presidential candidate in last year’s election.“Russia does not have loyalty to a political party in the United States,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee. “Their goal is to divide us and discredit our democracy.”But American intelligence agencies have concluded that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia tried to sway the election in favor of President Trump, beyond just posting disruptive content on social media. Russian operatives also hacked Democratic email accounts and released messages embarrassing to Hillary Clinton’s campaign.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and chairman of the subcommittee, asked Facebook to confirm a narrower point — that the pattern of activity it saw from Russia was more focused on sowing chaos in the United States than in bolstering Mr. Trump’s candidacy.“During the election, they were trying to create discord between Americans, most of it directed against Clinton,” Mr. Graham said, addressing Facebook’s general counsel, Colin Stretch. “After the election, you saw Russian-tied groups and organizations trying to undermine President Trump’s legitimacy. Is that what you saw on Facebook?”Mr. Stretch agreed.— Cecilia KangIn his opening remarks, Richard Salgado, Google’s senior counsel of law enforcement and information security, walked a tightrope. He said that the company was taking the threat of government-backed interference seriously, but noted that Google’s array of services functioned differently than its social media peers, Facebook and Twitter.He said while Russian agents used YouTube, owned by Google, to upload political videos, it gained momentum because of social media platforms.“We did observe that links to these videos were frequently posted to other social media platforms,” he said. “We believe that the relatively limited amount of activity we found is a result of the safeguards we had in place in advance of the election.” He added, “Google’s products also don’t lend themselves to the kind of targeting or viral dissemination these actors seem to prefer.”The distinction is one that Google has made privately, and it is more an accident of history — because Google’s social media efforts have largely failed — than an intentional strategy by the company.— Daisuke WakabayashiAfter some prodding from Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, Mr. Stretch shed more light on some of the ways the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency used Facebook to target Americans.For one, Mr. Stretch said about 75 percent of the 80,000 ads were targeted broadly at Americans as a whole. The goal, he noted, was largely to “sow discord and divisiveness” among Americans.But importantly, some 25 percent of the ads were targeted specifically to certain states and parts of the country. What is unclear — and what Facebook has yet to detail — is how many of those ads were targeted specifically to swing states in the run-up to the election.The tech company representatives talked at length about what they were doing to change how advertising worked on their sites. Facebook is testing a new type of transparency tool and database that will allow people to see who bought the ads they’re seeing. Facebook also said it was doubling its team that worked to remove objectionable content, to 20,000 employees from 10,000. Twitter banned RT, the Russian media arm, and is investing heavily in its Trust and Safety team.— Mike IsaacFacebook, Twitter and Google have been slow to acknowledge their significance in the Russian influence campaign. Right after the election, Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, scoffed at the idea that fake news on the site could have swayed public opinion before the election.It took months for the companies to begin their own investigations. In late September, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that information provided by Twitter and Facebook seemed to greatly underplay their problems.On Monday, the companies acknowledged the problem was much bigger.In prepared remarks, Facebook said inflammatory posts by Russian agents intending to sow discord among Americans reached 126 million users. Google said that the same agents, from the Internet Research Agency, uploaded over 1,000 videos on YouTube. Twitter said they published more 131,000 messages on Twitter.And the companies also acknowledged they were wading into new territory.“The abuse of our platform by sophisticated foreign actors to attempt state-sponsored manipulation of elections is a new challenge for us — and one that we are determined to meet,” Twitter’s acting general counsel, Sean Edgett, said in written testimony.Mr. Stretch said in written testimony, “The foreign interference we saw is reprehensible and outrageous and opened a new battleground for our company, our industry, and our society.”The companies stressed that over all, content connected to the Russian company was a sliver of all that they publish each day.But the new information will only raise more questions: How long did they know of the activity? How far back have they investigated the activity of these accounts? Beyond the Internet Research Agency, were there similar efforts by other foreign-linked companies?— Cecilia KangThe political winds have shifted for Silicon Valley, with a growing number of legislators sounding alarms in recent months over the power that Facebook, Google and Twitter have over public opinion.Some lawmakers are now proposing to rein them in by regulating political ads on their digital platforms. After Facebook disclosed in September that it had identified more than $100,000 in advertisements paid for by the Internet Research Agency, lawmakers proposed legislation that would ask websites to submit to the same sort of disclosures rules imposed on broadcast television.Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, called for the companies to explain what efforts they were making to ensure the same mistakes were not repeated.“Can you come to us and say, ‘We have accomplished X, and therefore you, as a Congress, don’t need to worry about legislating in this space or creating regulations or holding more hearings, because we have now got America’s back?’ Can you do that for me?” he asked.Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, was also expected to make a strong push for a bill that required sites like Facebook and YouTube to disclose the sources of funding for political ads. She recently introduced the legislation with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Mr. Warner.Ahead of the hearing, Facebook and Twitter announced they would voluntarily disclose the sources of funding behind political ads. Twitter went further to ban ads from two Kremlin-backed news outlets as well as vowing to disclose the source of funding for all ads.But lawmakers say self-regulations won’t cut it.“If their policies comply with our bill, they should support our bill and maybe can use their policy as a standard when we pass our bill,” Ms. Klobuchar said in a recent interview.— Cecilia KangPolitical ads are just part of the problem. Russian agents also spread nonpaid content through the creation of pages on Facebook dedicated to hot-button issues like race. On Twitter, the Internet Research Agency used automatic messaging tools known as bots that could quickly spread tweets through multiple accounts.Lawmakers are pressing the companies on what they’ve done to to fight misinformation on “organic posts” and bots.“They’re using our own social networks, our friendships, families and biases and viewpoints against us,” Mr. Whitehouse said.Another problem is issues-oriented ads that are not defined as political ads because they do not directly promote a political candidate. Such ads would include an environmental group publishing an ad attacking environmental deregulation or anti-immigration groups calling for stricter border policies.“I have a particular concern about issue advertisements, sock puppets, and the dissemination of made-up stories, tactics we know Russia and other actors have used extensively,” Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said in a statement before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Wednesday with the same executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter. The House Intelligence Committee also has a hearing scheduled.— Cecilia KangRepublican lawmakers are also beginning to criticize the Silicon Valley companies. This is important because any call for regulations by Republican lawmakers, who tend to be free-market-oriented, make the long-shot risk of tech legislation more plausible.In one contentious exchange, Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, pressed Mr. Stretch on whether Facebook could possibly have oversight of all of its advertisers.“I’m trying to get us down from la la land here,” Mr. Kennedy said. “The truth of the matter is, you have five million advertisers that change every month. Every minute. Probably every second. You don’t have the ability to know who every one of those advertisers is, do you?”Mr. Stretch acknowledged Mr. Kennedy’s point.— Cecilia Kang
Russian Influence Reached 126 Million Through Facebook Alone WASHINGTON — Russian agents intending to sow discord among American citizens disseminated inflammatory posts that reached 126 million users on Facebook, published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded over 1,000 videos to Google’s YouTube service, according to copies of prepared remarks from the companies that were obtained by The New York Times.The detailed disclosures, sent to Congress on Monday by companies whose products are among the most widely used on the internet, came before a series of congressional hearings this week into how third parties used social networks and online services to influence millions of Americans before the 2016 presidential election.The new information goes far beyond what the companies have revealed in the past and underline the breadth of the Kremlin’s efforts to lever open divisions in the United States using American technology platforms, especially Facebook. Multiple investigations of Russian meddling have loomed over the first 10 months of the Trump presidency, with one leading to the indictments of Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chief, and others on Monday.In its prepared remarks sent to Congress, Facebook said the Internet Research Agency, a shadowy Russian company linked to the Kremlin, had posted roughly 80,000 pieces of divisive content that was shown to about 29 million people between January 2015 and August 2017. Those posts were then liked, shared and followed by others, spreading the messages to tens of millions more people. Facebook also said it had found and deleted more than 170 accounts on its photo-sharing app Instagram; those accounts had posted about 120,000 pieces of Russia-linked content.Previously, Facebook had said it identified more than $100,000 in advertisements paid for by the Internet Research Agency.The Russia-linked posts were “an insidious attempt to drive people apart,” Colin Stretch, the general counsel for Facebook who will appear at the hearings, said in his prepared remarks. He called the posts “deeply disturbing,” and noted they focused on race, religion, gun rights, and gay and transgender issues.Facebook, Mr. Stretch said, was “determined to prevent it from happening again.”The new information also illuminated when Facebook knew there had been Russian interference on its platform. Several times before the election last Nov. 8, Facebook said its security team discovered threats targeted at employees of the major American political parties from a group called APT28, an agency that United States law enforcement officials have previously linked to Russian military intelligence operations.Facebook cautioned that the Russia-linked posts represented a minuscule amount of content compared with the billions of posts that flow through users’ News Feeds everyday. Between 2015 and 2017, people in the United States saw more than 11 trillion posts from Pages on Facebook.Twitter, in its prepared remarks, said it had discovered more than 2,700 accounts on its service that were linked to the Internet Research Agency between September 2016 and November 2016. Those accounts, which Twitter has suspended, posted roughly 131,000 tweets over that period.Outside of the activity of the Internet Research Agency, Twitter identified more than 36,000 automated accounts that posted 1.4 million election-related tweets linked to Russia over that three-month period. The tweets received approximately 288 million views, according to the company’s remarks.Twitter noted that the 1.4 million Russia-linked election tweets represented less than three-quarters of one percent of all election-related tweets during that period.Google, in its prepared statement, said it had also found evidence that the Internet Research Agency bought ads on its services and created YouTube channels to upload short videos about divisive social issues including law enforcement, race relations or Syria.Google said it had found 18 channels that were “likely associated” with the Russian agents that posted political videos to YouTube. All told, those accounts — now suspended — uploaded more than 1,100 videos totaling 43 hours of content from 2015 through the summer of 2017. Google said, in general, those videos had very low view counts that added up to 309,000 views between the middle of 2015 and late 2016. Only three percent of the videos had more than 5,000 views and there was no evidence that the accounts had targeted American viewers, the company said.The internet search giant also confirmed earlier reports that the Internet Research Agency had purchased search and display ads from it. Google said the group had bought $4,700 in ads but none of them had targeted users by their political leanings, which was a targeting tool that Google added before the election.Google had been investigating a separate $53,000 in ad purchases with political material from Russian internet or building addresses, but discovered that those were not related to the Kremlin.“While we found only limited activity on our services, we will continue to work to prevent all of it, because no amount of interference is acceptable,” wrote Richard Salgado, Google’s director of law enforcement and information security, and Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel. The two men were scheduled to testify at separate congressional committees on Tuesday and Wednesday.For Facebook, Google and Twitter, the discovery of Russian influence by way of their sites has been a rude awakening. The companies had long positioned themselves as spreading information and connecting people for positive ends. Now the companies must grapple with how Russian agents used their technologies exactly as they were meant to be used — but for malevolent purposes.That has led to thorny debates inside the companies. For Facebook, the problem is less straightforward than finding Russia-linked pages and taking down content. Executives worry about how stifling speech from non-American entities could set a precedent on the social network — and how it could potentially be used against other groups in the future.So Facebook has focused on the issue of authenticity — or the fact that the Russian agencies did not identify themselves as such — as a reason for taking down the accounts.“Many of these ads did not violate our content policies,” Elliot Schrage, vice president of policy and communications at Facebook, said in a company blog post earlier this month. “That means that for most of them, if they had been run by authentic individuals, anywhere, they could have remained on the platform.”Earlier this month, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner introduced a bipartisan bill to require internet companies to identify those who paid for political ads on the tech companies’ platforms.Facebook has been promoting its strengthened advertising disclosure policies as an attempt to pre-empt the bipartisan bill. Last week, Facebook began rolling out new features that provide insight into who is paying for ads, and it will maintain a publicly viewable database of ads purchased on the network.The company is also stepping up its counterintelligence and security measures. Facebook has said it is working with Twitter, Google and other companies to spot sophisticated threats earlier, and will continue to coordinate with law enforcement when appropriate. The company said it shuttered 5.8 million fake accounts in October 2016, and removed 30,000 accounts attempting to influence the French elections this year.Google also said it plans to increase its transparency for political ads. The company is working to issue an annual report about who is buying political ads and how much they are spending.The company also said it planned to create a publicly accessible database into what election ads ran on Google’s AdWords — for example, web search ads — and YouTube. Google said it will identify the advertisers paying for political ads within a link accessible from the ad.But Google said it did not intend to take any further action against state-backed Russian news channel RT, which has built a massive online audience through YouTube. The American intelligence community has described RT as the Kremlin’s “principal international propaganda outlet”, but Google said the organization had not violated any of its policies or misused the service.Last week, by contrast, Twitter said it would ban RT and Sputnik, another Kremlin-backed news organization, from advertising on its service.
How to Fix Facebook? We Asked 9 Experts Colin Stretch, the general counsel of Facebook, will appear on Tuesday before senators who are investigating how Russia spread misinformation online during the 2016 presidential campaign. Along with Google and Twitter, Facebook has been blamed for helping Russian agents influence the outcome of the election.But the cloud over Facebook extends far beyond Russia. Critics say the company’s central role in modern communication has undermined the news business, split Americans into partisan echo chambers and “hijacked” our minds with a product designed to keep us addicted to the social network.Of course, criticism of Facebook and its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, is easy to come by; solutions aren’t as clear. We asked nine technologists, academics, politicians and journalists to propose the steps they would take to improve Facebook — as a product, a company or both.Their responses, edited slightly for length and clarity, are below.Research director at Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism. With a recent Facebook change that algorithmically prioritizes “reactions” in the news feed over the standard “like,” the company appears to be pushing further into the realm of emotion-centered engagement. As they stand, and especially with algorithmic reinforcement, “reactions” and “likes” are like megaphones for echo chambers and news outrage.The single most important step Facebook — and its subsidiary Instagram, which I view as equally important in terms of countering misinformation, hate speech and propaganda — can take is to abandon the focus on emotional signaling-as-engagement.This is a tough proposition, of course, as billions of users have been trained to do exactly this: “react.”What if there were a “trust emoji”? Or respect-based emojis? If a palette of six emoji-faced angry-love-sad-haha emotional buttons continues to be the way we engage with one another — and how we respond to the news — then it’s going to be an uphill battle.Negative emotion, click bait and viral outrage are how the platform is “being used to divide.” Given this problem, Facebook needs to help us unite by building new sharing tools based on trust and respect.Co-founder of Wired magazine.Facebook should reduce anonymity by requiring real verification of real names for real people, with the aim of having 100 percent of individuals verified.Companies would need additional levels of verification, and should have a label and scrutiny different from those of people. (Whistle-blowers and dissidents might need to use a different platform.)Facebook could also offer an optional filter that would keep any post (or share) of an unverified account from showing up. I’d use that filter.Democrat representing California’s 17th Congressional District, which includes sections of Silicon Valley. Ultimately, whether from tech companies or Congress, what people want is more transparency.Facebook should expand on its Hard Questions blog to explain how its news feed algorithms work, how it uses data in targeting and how it makes decisions about third-party verification and removing offensive content. It should make it simple for users to provide feedback and be responsive to their concerns.The company also should make its executives readily available to the press, and they should spend time on Capitol Hill to explain their decision-making.Everyone understands that new technology platforms are not perfect, and that bad actors find ways to abuse them. The key is for Facebook to be upfront about technical challenges, open about its mistakes and willing to answer the tough questions honestly. If it does that, it will continue to earn the public’s trust.Chief executive of Upworthy and author of “The Filter Bubble.”Facebook should open itself up for independent research. Right now, Facebook is a black box: It’s very difficult, and in many cases impossible, for researchers to independently look at behavior on the platform. While opening private data to research creates risks, there’s a ton of explicitly public data on the platform that Facebook makes difficult to query at scale. Facebook could also open up many of the tools advertisers currently use for free use by research scientists. It would be a bold move for transparency, and one that would help us understand much better what’s happening on the world’s most important social platform. And it’d be wise to do this before regulators forced them to.The company should also optimize for “time well spent.” Facebook’s greatest superpower is figuring out how to eat as much of our attention as possible. But as Tristan Harris and others have pointed out, that attention often doesn’t yield much — leaving us poorly informed and feeling worse about ourselves. Instead of measuring clicks and likes, what if Facebook optimized for how much value an article or video or game gave us weeks or months afterward? The company could survey the kinds of content we’ve spent the most time on, and ask us which gave us the most and least value, as a way to balance our impulsive present selves with our greater aspirations.Early Facebook employee who recounted her time at the company in her book, “The Boy Kings: A Journey Into the Heart of the Social Network.”It would be interesting if Facebook offered a “vintage Facebook” setting that users could toggle to, without News Feed ads and “like” buttons. (Before “likes,” users wrote comments, which made interactions more unique and memorable.)A “vintage Facebook” setting not only would be less cluttered, it would refocus the experience of using Facebook on the people using it, and their intentions for communication and interaction.Somehow, no matter how “smart” the Facebook algorithms and behind-the-scenes data processing get, the site felt more engaging as a tool for human communication when interaction was primarily driven by what users wanted to do and say, rather than where the algorithms want people to look.Assistant professor of communication at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Facebook should allow users to sort their news feed chronologically by default on all platforms, rather than rely on an algorithmically sorted News Feed. This would increase the diversity of items in the News Feed, and would make it more likely that users were exposed to people and information that didn’t support their own confirmation bias.It should also greatly increase the human oversight of ad targeting systems — specifically, oversee algorithmically generated categories (rather than basing them solely on user-inputted interests). Political and interest-based advertising should be under much stricter scrutiny than, say, the advertising of T-shirts or hair products.Chief diversity and inclusion officer at the Kapor Center for Social Impact and a former chief executive of Reddit.Facebook needs to replace its focus on engagement quantity with interaction quality. To really do that means replacing at least half of the leadership team and board with underrepresented people of color who are informed and value diversity and inclusion — and, as my colleague Freada Kapor Klein suggested, have journalistic principles. At Reddit, I was able to effect positive, lasting change (at least according to this research) to content quality and interaction quality by building a diverse executive team.Adviser and former news executive at NPR, NBC News and Twitter.The single most important thing Facebook must do is come clean. Tell us what you know. Tell us what you know but can’t share. Tell us what you don’t know. And tell us what you don’t know that you don’t know. Stop hiding behind bromides like “we are not a media company.” That makes us think you don’t understand you have a serious set of problems that need fixing. Coming clean may not be the only thing, and may not be the main thing, but it’s the first thing.Professor at Columbia Law School and author of “The Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to Get Inside Our Heads.”Facebook should become a public benefit corporation. These companies must aim to do something that would aid the public, and board members must also take that public benefit into account when making decisions. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Facebook’s goals are “bringing us closer together” and “building a global community.” Worthy, beautiful goals, but easier said than done when Facebook is also stuck delivering ever-increasing profits and making its platform serve the needs of advertisers.What if Facebook were actually free to do what it says it wants to? What if it didn’t need to devote so much energy to the evil sides of the business, whether catering to filter bubbles, addicting and manipulating users, seizing data, bending over backward for advertisers and destroying competitors? As a nonprofit or public benefit corporation (like Kickstarter), Facebook could be a much better institution. It could shed its “two masters” dilemma, truly pursue its lofty goals and become a firm of which its users and the world could actually be proud.
Dartmouth College Professors Investigated for Alleged Sexual Misconduct HANOVER, N.H. — Three Dartmouth College professors whose research had included studies of sexual desire and attractiveness have been put on paid leave while a criminal investigation of alleged sexual misconduct is carried out, the authorities said Tuesday.Attorney General Gordon J. MacDonald of New Hampshire said his office was part of a joint criminal investigation by five law enforcement agencies into allegations of “serious misconduct” by the professors, all tenured faculty members of the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. The professors’ access to the Dartmouth campus here has been restricted.Details of the allegations were not released, but Mr. MacDonald’s statement said the criminal investigation arose after an inquiry to college officials by the college newspaper, The Dartmouth, which reported last week that the professors had disappeared from their campus posts and fliers had been posted around campus inquiring as to their whereabouts.At that time, the college announced that it was conducting its own investigation.News of a criminal investigation with no additional explanation to the 4,300 undergraduate and 2,000 graduate students left them some of them bewildered.Several students hanging out at the Collis student center on Tuesday said they were surprised by the allegations because all three professors were established and respected intellectuals in their fields. They were also popular with students.Maggie Pizzo, a junior math major, said she was concerned that the professors had been put on paid leave as opposed to suspended without pay.“By paying them, it seems to be condoning the acts,” whatever they were, she said, as well as being “disrespectful” toward whoever brought the allegation of harassment.“It seems to minimize the whole thing,” Ms. Pizzo said.One female student, a junior, said she felt “pretty uncomfortable” that the administration had apparently known about the allegations for some time and was only addressing it publicly now.“It’s creepy, even though we don’t really know what it is,” the junior, who declined to give her name, said. “People have been pretty weirded out by this.”She said that graduate students were filling in for the banned professors and that some students felt short-changed by not being taught by the scholars they had signed up for.In a separate statement on Tuesday, the president of Dartmouth, Philip J. Hanlon, said the university was cooperating with the criminal investigations of the three professors, identified by the newspaper as Todd F. Heatherton, William M. Kelley and Paul J. Whalen.Dr. Heatherton leads a center for social brain sciences and, according to the college’s website, conducts research in social behavior focusing on self-regulation, self-esteem and self-referential processing. Dr. Kelley’s work focuses on memory and self-regulation, according to the website.The two were among authors in 2012 on research on how images of food and sex affect the brain. As part of the research, 58 female college freshmen underwent brain scans shortly after arrival on campus while viewing 80 images each of animals, environmental scenes, food items and people — some involved in sexual scenes or consuming alcohol. Six months later, they were called back to the lab, weighed and questioned on their sexual behavior.The study, published in the Journal Neuroscience, concluded that the students whose brains reacted to food and sexual stimuli gained more weight and reported greater sexual desire in the follow-up questioning. The study was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Dr. Whalen was listed as having assisted in that study.Dr. Whalen, a popular professor on campus who delivered a TedXDartmouth talk, runs the Whalen Lab, which conducts research on a part of the brain known as the amygdala. Among his published research papers was a collaboration with Drs. Kelley and Heatherton and others on the question of whether the brains of men and women react differently to attractive facial features in members of the opposite sex. That paper was published in 2008 in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience.None of the professors could be reached immediately for comment.“I want to say in the most emphatic way possible that sexual misconduct and harassment are unacceptable and have no place at Dartmouth,” Mr. Hanlon said. “Such acts harm us as individuals and as members of the community.”Mr. Hanlon’s statement referred the campus community to Dartmouth’s “sexual respect” website.
In a Superstar Economy, a Bull Market in Superstar Harassers In the recent wave of reports of workplace sexual harassment, a recurring theme stands out: the willingness of companies’ supposed overseers to ignore credible allegations in order to retain a perceived star.Whether it was Bill O’Reilly at Fox, which reportedly gave Mr. O’Reilly a $100 million contract extension just weeks after he signed a $32 million settlement with an accuser, or Harvey Weinstein, who paid out at least eight settlements to women who had accused him of harassment and unwanted contact, employers and board members appear to have gone to great lengths to avoid jeopardizing the careers of luminaries accused of misbehavior.The pattern is so well established that an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission task force, in a report on sexual harassment last year, gave those who benefit from it a name: “superstar” harassers.“When the superstar misbehaves, employers may perceive themselves in a quandary,” the report said. “They may be tempted to ignore the misconduct because, the thinking goes, losing the superstar would be too costly.”Superstar harassers account for a fraction of the harassment allegations in the workplace, according to Chai R. Feldblum, one of the commissioners who oversaw the report, but these individuals can have considerable impact. Superstars are able to evade the consequences of their actions for years, and they exert outsize influence over their organizations.And because the labor market has created more and more superstars in recent decades, as economists have repeatedly found, the number of harassers in that category is probably growing.“The superstar harassers do cast a long shadow,” Ms. Feldblum said. “If it is well known in a workplace that someone at that level is getting away with bad behavior, that then sends a message down the ranks.”Partly as a result, the costs of retaining a superstar harasser outweigh the benefits, even in narrow economic terms, according to research cited by the commission.Social scientists have long documented the ways that power changes people’s psychology. It increases their sense of entitlement — when inequality is high, the affluent have a strong belief that they deserve their money, one recent study suggested — and diminishes their inhibitions.An experiment published in a psychology journal in 2008 found that men who were given power over women tended to flirt more overtly than men who lacked such power. Another experiment found that those who thought of themselves as powerful underestimated both personal risks, like the chances of developing gum disease, and a more general level of risk, like the number of people who die in plane crashes each year.“They don’t see threats even if they’re right in front of their face,” Cameron Anderson, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and an author of the second study, said in an interview. Alluding to superstar harassers, Professor Anderson added, “They’re so focused on sexual gratification, they don’t see the moral, ethical and legal problems.”Many people in an organization, from the most junior scheduler to the chief executive, have some form of power. The distinctive feature of superstars is that they are more likely to use their power with impunity.Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard University, said in an interview that although he had seen no reliable data on superstars and sexual harassment per se, evidence showed that organizations tended to tolerate a wide range of misbehavior from people they perceived as stars. “They seem to also get away with things,” he said, “in a way they would never be able to do if they were not viewed as superstars.”Professor Katz cited a study by two economists in which corporate chief executives who won high-profile awards, typically those conferred by major business publications, subsequently spent more time away from the job on outside pursuits like writing books. They were also more likely to manipulate the earnings that their companies reported.Such license to misbehave appears to have been common for stars in some of the recent high-profile harassment cases. A former Fox News producer who quit several years ago said that Mr. O’Reilly’s contention that no one had complained about him to the network’s human resources department was basically meaningless because bringing a complaint meant having to be ready to quit.(Fox News brought in a new head of human resources this year who was given responsibility for overhauling and expanding the department and who reports directly to the network’s corporate parent.)In a CNN report, women who worked at ABC News made allegations of inappropriate advances and sexual contact by Mark Halperin, a prominent journalist who was once the division’s political director, but said they feared reporting him to network executives because Mr. Halperin had been a powerful figure there.Mr. Halperin has denied nonconsensual contact with the women; an ABC News representative said the network considered harassment and retaliation unacceptable and encouraged employees to come forward if they encountered such behavior.And Susan Fowler, an engineer who quit her job at Uber after contending with what she said was sexism and sexual harassment, wrote a widely read blog post in which she described complaints she filed against two fellow employees that were never acted on. The reason she said she was given for the inaction was that each of the men was a “high performer.”The irony is that the calculation that persuades employers to ignore bad behavior by stars is frequently wrong, and not just because of the potential damage to an organization’s image if the bad behavior comes to light.A study by two researchers in 2015 found that the benefit to an employer of retaining a “toxic” employee, such as a sexual harasser, who was in the top 1 percent of productivity was outweighed by the cost of keeping that employee — by a ratio of more than two to one, and probably by far more than that.A crucial reason, the study concluded, was that toxic workers tended to drive out other employees, a phenomenon that appeared to have occurred in some recent high-profile cases. Ms. Fowler wrote that when she started working at Uber in November 2015, women made up more than one-quarter of her department. Within 13 months, according to her blog post, the share had fallen below 6 percent, with sexism being a major factor.At Fox News, a prime-time star, Megyn Kelly, left in what was reported to be disillusionment over an atmosphere in which the mistreatment of women — including the behavior of Mr. O’Reilly — was tolerated.(The study on the costs of retaining toxic employees relied on data encompassing thousands of customer-support and other front-line service workers, but the evidence suggested that a similar result would apply in many higher-stakes industries, one of the authors, Dylan Minor of Northwestern University, said in an interview.)The growth of a superstar economy is reflected in a greater concentration of money and power among those at the top. A generation or two ago, a top worker who was slightly better than his or her peers tended to receive a moderate premium in earnings. Today, with companies operating on a more sweeping scale, that premium is much higher. Top performers only slightly better than their peers tend to make vastly more money.“It’s really taken off in the last two decades,” Professor Katz of Harvard said. “You see it in broad measures of income, and even in the raw data — the hedge fund manager, finance people, C.E.O. data, top academics, top lawyers.”In effect, the rest of the economy is becoming more like Hollywood, where a small group of stars of have long reaped a huge portion of the rewards. That means more bosses and boards may soon face decisions about whether to stand up to harassers or to overlook their behavior.“To the extent that technology gives you the power to serve a broader swath of the market, and you’ve got more leverage as a result,” said Robert H. Frank, a Cornell University economist who has written extensively about superstars, “that’s not slowed down one iota.”
Netflix Suspends Production of ‘House of Cards’ Production on the final season of “House of Cards” was suspended Tuesday, two days after its star, Kevin Spacey, was accused of having made an unwanted sexual advance toward a 14-year-old boy in the 1980s.In a statement, Netflix and Media Rights Capital, the studio behind the show, said production was being halted “to give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew.”On Monday, executives from both companies spoke to the cast and crew of “House of Cards” in Baltimore, where production of its sixth season had recently gotten underway. The streaming service announced on Monday that the season would be the show’s last. A spokeswoman for Netflix said that decision had been reached months ago, long before the allegation against Mr. Spacey.On Sunday, BuzzFeed reported an allegation by the actor Anthony Rapp that Mr. Spacey had made an unwanted sexual advance toward him in the 1980s, when he was 14 and Mr. Spacey was in his mid-20s. Mr. Spacey released a statement shortly after the article was published in which he said that he did not recall the episode but attributed it to “deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.”The decision to stop production raises questions about whether it will resume, and, if it does, whether Mr. Spacey will return to the series. Also on Tuesday, Variety reported that the start-up MasterClass had pulled Mr. Spacey’s $90 online acting lesson videos from its site.Over the summer, production for the ABC reality show “Bachelor in Paradise” was shut down after an allegation of sexual misconduct on the show’s set. Production resumed after an investigation turned up no wrongdoing.
In the Heart of ‘The Resistance,’ California Conservatives Are Invigorated LOS ANGELES — California conservatives are feeling a strange sense of invigoration these days. Yes, they are vastly outnumbered, shouted off college campuses and scolded that their way of politics is an anachronism in this bright blue bulwark of the liberal resistance.But California has become, however improbably, a leading exporter of the energy that is animating the conservative movement, and it is giving rise to some of the loudest new voices on the right, from the West Wing to the radical fringe.Some of the most strident conservatives in President Trump’s orbit have honed and hardened their political identities in California. There is Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s ousted but still influential chief strategist, who was showered with standing ovations when he spoke at the state Republican convention in Anaheim last weekend. And there is Stephen Miller, a senior White House adviser from Santa Monica who has helped shape the White House’s restrictive immigration policy.Several of the most aggressively pro-Trump media outlets and personalities, which provide a critical line of support between the president and his base, are based in California, like Mr. Bannon’s nationalist-oriented Breitbart News and Michael Savage, a radio host who has raised the specter of civil war if Mr. Trump is removed from office. Two of the far-right’s best-known pro-Trump conspiracy theory peddlers, Mike Cernovich and Charles C. Johnson, work from California.And California is home to some of the most Trump-friendly academics, who have made the intellectual case for the president’s agenda in scholarly publications like the Claremont Review of Books. Last fall the review published a widely read essay by Michael Anton, a native Californian and national security aide in the Trump administration, who argued that a Hillary Clinton presidency would be like “Russian roulette with a semi-auto.”“It’s almost an inverse proportion: The less powerful we got in California, the more powerful we got nationally,” said Ben Shapiro, a writer and commentator from Southern California. Mr. Shapiro founded the Daily Wire, a right-leaning website that he helps run out of an office in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of the San Fernando Valley.“California’s Republican Party is largely moribund, but a lot of California is the intellectual center for the Republican Party,” Mr. Shapiro added, offering one possible explanation for the disconnect. “When you’re not in governance, that allows you to be a little more creative in the ideas you espouse.”Republicans are shut out of statewide office here, and have been for most of this decade. Twenty-five years ago, they made up almost 40 percent of the state’s registered voters; today, they are barely 25 percent. In many races, they don’t even appear on the ballot any more, because the state’s primary system allows the two top vote-getters to advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation, and they are often both Democrats.And few states have done more to try to thwart President Trump’s agenda on issues like the environment and immigration.Still, some conservatives see a cautionary tale in California, where the Republican Party sank into political irrelevance in recent years as it became defined by an unyielding line on immigration, an enthusiastic embrace of the culture wars and a willingness to exploit racial divisions. It was only 10 years ago that California had a centrist Republican governor in Arnold Schwarzenegger. And even though a larger share of voters than ever are registering with no party affiliation, Republicans remain woefully uncompetitive in the state.“By all accounts, there should be this sort of vibrant center-right movement in California that’s contesting those voters,” said Lanhee Chen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution who advises Republican candidates and grew up in the Los Angeles area. “But you’re really not seeing that.”The issues now stoking the conservative populism that has taken over the Republican Party — political correctness, affirmative action, the flight of blue-collar jobs overseas, illegal immigration and government bloat — simmered in California for decades before Mr. Trump rode them to the White House.The ardently anti-communist, aggressively nationalist John Birch Society developed one of its largest followings in Orange County in the 1960s. The fight over Proposition 13 in the late 1970s, which limited property-tax increases, became a national cause for anti-tax, anti-government conservatives. And in the 1990s, California voters approved ballot initiatives intended to strike blows against the liberalism of the Clinton era by banning affirmative-action policies at state institutions and by preventing undocumented immigrants from having access to public services like schools and hospitals.Because California was at the forefront of the demographic changes reshaping the country’s politics, the questions now dividing the national Republican Party hit California much earlier. That would give Republicans a preview of the debate now raging over the future of their party today: whether to double down on nationalism or take a more accommodating approach to immigration.“That blowback to liberalism and the Republican establishment develops in California,” said Lawrence Rosenthal, director of the Center for Right Wing Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. “And I think it’s not a surprise that it develops in California, because of what happened in California with the arrival of a majority minority.”He added: “California was at once the poster child for changing demography; the poster child for the Republican establishment saying, ‘We have to have an opening on immigration or we’ll become a regional party’; and the poster child for this more extreme nationalist ideology.”In Pete Wilson, a Republican former governor, many people see an early template for Mr. Trump. Mr. Wilson championed Proposition 187, the 1994 measure that would have cut off public services for undocumented immigrants and that became a national rallying cry on both the right and the left. (Though it passed with 59 percent of the vote, Proposition 187 was blocked by a federal court and never went into effect.)Mr. Wilson remains unapologetic, and said he was convinced that Mr. Trump understands what he did back then, and how confronting illegal immigration spoke powerfully to disaffected conservatives.“Trump, however he divined this, was talking about these things, and a lot of people who should have been weren’t,” Mr. Wilson said in an interview from his law office on the 28th floor of a high rise in Century City. Mr. Wilson, who said he voted for Trump enthusiastically — “Hell yes” — regrets only the way Proposition 187 became to be perceived.“It convinced a number of Latino Californians that they were living in a place run by bigots, because that’s the way it was portrayed. And it made a lot of Republican politicians gun-shy.”The reaction to the initiative certainly caused many Republicans to rethink a hard-right position on immigration. But it emboldened others.“There’s a rebellious tone to conservatism in California that doesn’t exist in places where conservatism is actually a governing force,” said Mr. Shapiro, who is a former editor for Breitbart News. Andrew Breitbart, the site’s founder, grew up in Los Angeles, where the community of conservatives is small enough that he eventually found himself in the company of people like Mr. Shapiro, whose writing as a student for the University of California Los Angeles caught his eye. Mr. Breitbart also grew close to Mr. Bannon, who was working in Hollywood as a producer of right-wing documentaries when they became friends.Mr. Breitbart died in 2011, but much of the site and its business operations are still run out of offices on the West Side of the city. Joel Pollak, the editor at large, often writes about California politics — one recent article typical of the site’s coverage bore the headline, “Christopher Columbus Statue Fenced Off on L.A.’s 1st ‘Indigenous Peoples Day’” — and he said he considers his assignment for Breitbart readers to be “like a foreign correspondent, telling them what life is like here.”For conservatives, he said, “liberal California has become a political and cultural crucible.”California has also become a battleground in the resistance to “the resistance,” the informal liberal opposition to Mr. Trump. Right-wing speakers like Ann Coulter, Milo Yiannopoulos and Mr. Shapiro have all chosen the deeply liberal campus of the University of California at Berkeley as a place to speak, despite the threat of violence from leftist demonstrators. And they point to the way they are shunned on campus — both Ms. Coulter and Mr. Yiannopoulos had to cancel their planned speeches, and nine people were arrested outside the hall where Mr. Shapiro spoke last month — as examples of left-wing thought-policing.In August, liberal Angelenos were outraged when the Santa Monica Symphony Orchestra invited Dennis Prager, a conservative writer and radio host based in Los Angeles, to be a guest conductor. Seven symphony members said they would refuse to play under his direction.But the uproar made Mr. Prager, a classical music aficionado who has argued that Mr. Trump’s election “may have saved the country,” into a cause célèbre on the right. The event sold out.
Preserving a Cluster of Fishing Shacks From Hudson’s ‘Forgotten’ Past HUDSON, N.Y. — In the City of Hudson, known to tourists for its antique shops and fine dining, a cluster of century-old fishing shacks from the Hudson River estuary’s once prosperous shad fishery teeters on the waterfront.Some of the shacks were once used as year-round residences by sportsmen and commercial fishermen over the years, said Leo Bower, 63, who grew up in Hudson and now lives in the neighboring town of Greenport. As a resident historian, Mr. Bower has collected binders full of black-and-white photographs of the shacks and shares stories with visitors about the fishermen and hunters he met who used the shacks.For the most part, he said, the shacks were used for getaways and as staging areas for people fishing in the river and hunting on the bay and on a nearby island for duck and deer.When he was a boy, he said, it was also a place where older fishermen told stories and taught practices from an earlier era.Now, an effort to preserve some of the 17 remaining shacks is underway.The shacks sit on city-owned land on the shore of North Bay and have been vacant since the last denizens were evicted in 2012. The site has appeared on maps since the 1880s.In 2015, Hudson’s City Council voted to demolish almost all of the shacks, but before the razing began, the New York State Historic Preservation Office declared the site eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.On Aug. 1, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said the state would award a $10 million grant to the city for waterfront and downtown projects. Listed in the application was $165,000 for stabilizing structures and improving access on the North Bay at the site known by various names, including the Furgary, Shantytown, the North Dock Tin Boat Association and also “the shacks.”“It’s part of Hudson’s really sordid and unique past and I think it should absolutely be preserved,” said Sheena Salvino, head of the Hudson Development Corporation, which helped prepare the city’s grant application. “In what form, I don’t pretend to know. But with a little creativity something cool could happen.”Mr. Bower and another resident, Timothy O’Connor, have begun planning to preserve 10 or so of the shacks. Mr. O’Connor said he envisions a museum showcasing tools and memorabilia from the shad fishery, which closed in 2010.“We would like to see the shacks that are preserved be used in commemoration of the river activities, which were always the focus of successive generations of Shantytown dwellers,” he said.Mr. O’Connor, a bird-watcher who was the personal assistant to the poet John Ashbery for 10 years, said $165,000 would be more than enough to preserve the shacks, especially if volunteers helped.“These are shacks,” he said. “They require annual work after the winter. But it’s not a great deal of work.”Mayor Tiffany Martin Hamilton said an effort to save some shacks needs to begin as soon as possible.Ms. Hamilton, whose grandfather built one of the shacks, said the site was one of the last remnants of “Old Hudson,” which was a closer community than today’s version of the small city.“It’s a forgotten era, a closed chapter in Hudson’s history. It represents generations of people — old Hudson grit in a good way. And it represents all of the things our community struggles with today — economic disparity in the community that drives this divide between people. It all played out here,” she said.Last year, Ms. Hamilton had fencing removed to restore access to the land surrounding the shacks, including the boat launch.Mr. Bower reconnected with his estranged father nearly 50 years ago at the shacks. They netted shad and herring on the river, made turtle soup over a wood-burning stove and prepared fish for a homemade smoker at the site. The younger Mr. Bower held his wedding reception outside of the shacks in 1983. He kept a 13-foot boat docked there that he used to take his wife and two sons on river excursions.In the 2015 report for the state’s historic preservation office, the authors Linda Mackey, a historic preservation specialist for 14 upstate counties, and Daria Merwin, a co-director of the cultural resource survey program at the New York State Museum in Albany, wrote that the site has “the tangible remains of a traditional way of life that is rapidly disappearing,” which “represent a time when sturgeon and shad were abundant in the Hudson River, and people made their livelihoods fishing the river and selling their catch on the shore.”Ms. Merwin said she has since given two presentations about maritime cultural landscapes and featured the North Bay shacks as a case study.“I’d like to see as much of the fabric retained as possible,” she said. “I hope there’s some common ground that everyone can buy into in terms of seeing some of them preserved, seeing some public access and seeing some interpretation of the site so people understand their local history. It really tells a story of the Hudson River in a bigger way.”
Facebook, Paul Manafort, Manus Island: Your Wednesday Briefing Good morning. Here’s what you need to know:• The indictments of President Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his longtime deputy have cast a shroud of foreboding over the White House. Here’s a wrap-up of the dizzying series of events on Monday.Our correspondent writes that it was ambition that brought Mr. Manafort down. Here’s how federal investigators explain one of the charges: laundering $18 million. And this video traces the other scandals in Mr. Manafort’s career.A surprising figure emerged: a young foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, who lied to the F.B.I. about seeking to be a conduit for Russian “dirt” to the Trump campaign. Mr. Trump dismissed him as a “low level volunteer” who has “proven to be a liar,” a few hours before attending a meeting on tax reform at the White House, above._____• More than 600 refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island stockpiled supplies and dug in after Australia cut off access to food, water and electricity to the offshore detention center on Tuesday. Control reverts to Papua New Guinea today.“We are begging for our freedom in a safe nation after more than four years of imprisonment, waiting, feeling lost and drifting in this concentration camp,” said a Rohingya migrant from Myanmar.Photographs posted online showed the detainees barricading the center with wire, in part to secure themselves from locals. The country’s ABC news organization is reporting from inside the camp._____• Our Interpreter columnists re-examine the legacy of Aung San Suu Kyi, the pro-democracy icon now under international fire for her inaction on the Myanmar military’s brutal treatment of Rohingya Muslims.“If Suu Kyi had so far to fall,” one analyst told them, “it is because the international community raised her so high.”_____• Executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google, above, began two days of grilling in Washington by lawmakers investigating Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election, including how the online platforms were used to spread misinformation and propaganda.Prepared remarks obtained by The Times show the reach of the Russian interference: 126 million users on Facebook, 131,000 messages on Twitter and 1,000 videos on Google’s YouTube.We asked technologists, academics, politicians and journalists how to fix Facebook. And our behavioral science reporter recently explained the psychological factors that make us so vulnerable to misinformation on social media._____• Grisly crimes are rare in Japan, which has one of the lowest murder rates in the world.That’s one reason this case has stunned the country: A police search for a missing woman who had sought a suicide partner turned up a self-confessed serial killer.Explaining his possession of mutilated bodies and coolers containing severed heads, he said he had killed nine people since moving into his apartment in the townhouse above in August, and dismembered them in his bathtub._____President Xi Jinping has staked his legacy on an ambitious plan to eradicate rural poverty in China by 2020.The plan targets the more than 43 million people, like Li Chao, above, who still live on less than 95 cents a day, the poverty line set by the Chinese government. Five years ago, about 100 million people lived below that line. Even so, achieving Mr. Xi’s lofty vision will be no easy task.• A rare proxy fight between a Chinese internet company — Sina, which controls the Weibo social media platform — and one of its U.S. investors underscores the corporate governance issues that surround many U.S.-traded Chinese firms.• Samsung appointed three new top executives to bring stability to its rocky leadership. The South Korean tech giant also reported record-high profits for the second consecutive quarter.• Airbus, already embroiled in a European corruption investigation, said that it may have violated U.S. rules on arms exports.• Netflix halted production on the final season of “House of Cards” following an accusation that Kevin Spacey, the show’s star, accosted a 14-year-old boy in the 1980s.• Unitree, a Chinese start-up, made a four-legged robot called Laikago. A video of the doglike machine has gone viral.• U.S. stocks were up. Here’s a snapshot of global markets.• Catalonia’s former leader, Carles Puigdemont, said he was in Brussels to put Spain’s conflict “in the institutional heart of Europe,” not to seek political asylum.

California Today: Kevin de León Confronts a Crisis in the Capital Good morning.(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Please note: A California Today newsletter from June was sent out in error yesterday. Apologies for the confusion.Today’s introduction is written by Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief.Just over two weeks ago, Kevin de León, the Democratic leader of the California state Senate since 2014, announced he was challenging Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, in a primary.Two days later, the Los Angeles Times reported that 140 women — legislative aides, lobbyist and state lawmakers — had signed a letter attesting to an atmosphere of pervasive sexual misconduct in the capital. That has set off a two-week examination not only of the male-dominated culture of Sacramento but also of what is, by every account, a flawed system for reporting sexual harassment in the Senate and the Assembly..Within hours of the letter, Mr. de León put out a statement applauding the “the courage of women working in and around the Capitol who are coming forward.” Later he announced that the Senate had hired outside consultants to look into allegations of sexual misconduct, and to review the policies and procedures now in place for collecting sexual harassment complaints.Would that be enough? Perhaps not. “Major surgery is required, and de León is offering a Band-Aid,” said Nathan Ballard, a Democratic strategist who is supporting Ms. Feinstein. “This will be a big issue that dogs de León at every campaign stop until he does the right thing. A press release isn’t going to make it go away.”The California Democratic Party Women’s Caucus also called for the appointment of an outside independent body, denouncing “secret proceedings” in which women are forced to bring their complaints to superiors and fellow-workers. The Assembly has scheduled open public hearing to spotlight flaws in the system.And on Monday night, Mr. de León issued a statement acknowledging the extent of the problem.“Unfortunately, as we’ve learned in recent days, the system doesn’t work if the employees it’s designed to protect don’t have complete trust and confidence in it,” he said. Mr. de León said he had ordered a re-evaluation of those policies with “the intention of replacing or strengthening our current process with a trauma-informed set of policies that all our employees, and the women who work in and around the Capitol, can be assured will protect them.”(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)• A 17-year-old died from burns suffered during the wine country fires.

[The New York Times]In the early 1990s, River Phoenix was regarded as among the most promising actors of his generation.Standout performances in films like “Stand By Me,” “My Own Private Idaho” and “Running on Empty,” for which he earned an Oscar nomination, made him a darling of the critics — and a heartthrob of American teenagers.Then, at age 23, Mr. Phoenix collapsed and died outside a West Hollywood club on this day in 1993. The cause was drug overdose.Mr. Phoenix was supremely gifted, said Gavin Edwards, author of “Last Night at the Viper Room,” a biography of Mr. Phoenix.“He was right alongside Brad Pitt, Keanu Reeves and that whole generation but just before they started to get huge,” he said. “And there were all these people after he died who said, ‘You know he was the one who had it. He had this spark.’”On the night of his death, he was at The Viper Room, a magnet for young actors and musicians on the Sunset Strip.Johnny Depp, a co-owner of the club, was there. So was Leonardo DiCaprio, Christina Applegate, Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Mr. Phoenix’s siblings Joaquin and Rain.At some point Mr. Phoenix consumed heroin and cocaine and began having seizures on the sidewalk outside the club, Mr. Edwards said. Efforts to revive him failed.The loss of River Phoenix was widely mourned. Yet he never quite attained the folk hero status of other talented figures who died young, such as James Dean.That may have something to do with Mr. Phoenix’s acting credits, which remained thin at his young age.But Mr. Edwards has another theory: His death was overshadowed by that of another young star. Five months after the night at the Viper Room, Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain fatally shot himself.“It sort of strange to think there’s this economy of attention in death,” Mr. Edwards said. “But there is.”California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

After 91 Years, New York Will Let Its People Boogie A nearly century-old law that turned New York bars into no-dancing zones, prevented singers like Billie Holiday and Ray Charles from performing and drew protest from Frank Sinatra, is finally set to be struck down.The Cabaret Law was created during Prohibition to patrol speakeasies, and while its restrictions on musicians came and went, the ban on social dancing has remained — leaving generations of club owners flicking the lights or playing “Eleanor Rigby” to still the crowd, lest they be fined or padlocked by the police in midnight raids. It is an odd and archaic regulation in a city that thinks of itself as a night life capital, but one that has resisted multiple attempts at repeal.That is expected to end on Tuesday, when a bill introduced by Rafael Espinal, a councilman from Brooklyn, comes before the City Council. Mr. Espinal, who embraced an effort by advocates in his district, which includes Bushwick, where bars and D.I.Y. venues have proliferated in recent years, says he has the 26 votes needed to pass it.“It’s over,” he said of the law.In New York City, only 97 out of roughly 25,000 eating and drinking establishments have a cabaret license. Obtaining one is costly and time-consuming, requiring the approval of several agencies, and only businesses in areas zoned for commercial manufacturing are eligible. Though the law has not been aggressively enforced since the Giuliani administration, it keeps bar and club owners “living in fear,” said Mr. Espinal, and pushes dancers from safe, regulated spaces into potentially hazardous underground ones.A spokesman for the mayor, Ben Sarle, said in an email, “The mayor strongly supports repealing the law,” though he emphasized the need to retain some of its security requirements, such as mandatory security cameras and certified security guards at larger venues, which were added to the existing law in the last 15 years.Norman Siegel, the former director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, tried unsuccessfully to strike down the Cabaret Law, filing a lawsuit in state court around a decade ago alongside Paul Chevigny, a civil rights lawyer, arguing it violated dancers’ free speech rights. Mr. Siegel reacted with joy to the possibility that it could be repealed. “Hallelujah to that,” he said. “It was used periodically to be very repressive on free expression.”The Cabaret Law was enacted in 1926. It made it illegal to host “musical entertainment, singing, dancing or other form of amusement” without a license. The law is widely believed to have originally been used to target racially mixed jazz clubs in Harlem, but it was broadly applied. Music was not permitted at unlicensed bars at all until 1936, when the law was amended  to allow radio- and piano-playing. The same year, operators of a ship that had taken men from the Bowery Mission on a day cruise were fined for running an unlicensed cabaret because a tap dancer was on board.From 1940 to 1967, the city required performers and employees of cabarets to be fingerprinted and carry “cabaret cards,” which could be denied if the applicant had a police record. The star-studded list of musicians who were denied cards or had them revoked includes Thelonious Monk and Charlie Parker. “Billie Holiday could not get a club date for many years before her death because she had a narcotics record. Ray Charles the blind blues singer cannot work here for the same reason,” an article in The Times noted in 1966. Frank Sinatra refused to sing in New York for years rather than submit to the indignity of the required fingerprinting.Around the same time, Greenwich Village coffeehouses were fined for operating as unlicensed cabarets after hosting musicians. Clubs were shut down if they violated a so-called three-musician rule, which, until it was challenged by Mr. Chevigny in the late 1980s, permitted unlicensed venues to host no more than three musicians, who, for a long time, were also barred from playing wind and percussion instruments.In the 1990s, under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the city revived the Cabaret Law, using it to shut down dance clubs as part of its quality-of-life initiatives. As rave culture bloomed around the world, New Yorkers learned their city had a no-dancing law, sometimes only when a task force — known as March, for Multi Agency Response to Community Hotspots — swooped in.Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration has issued relatively few citations, but Mr. Espinal said he found a groundswell of support for a repeal in Bushwick this year. At a town-hall meeting about night life initiatives at Market Hotel this spring, advocates immediately steered the conversation toward the Cabaret Law. “We came in sort of as a flash mob,” said John Barclay, who runs Bossa Nova Civic Club in Bushwick, which does not have a cabaret license.Andrew Muchmore, a lawyer and bar owner, filed a still-pending lawsuit against the city after his bar, Muchmore’s, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was slapped with a cabaret violation in 2013 by a police officer who spotted people “swaying” at a rock show while investigating a noise complaint, Mr. Muchmore said. His legal argument focused on how the law limits the type of music venues can feature, infringing freedom of expression, and a decision by the judge early in the case indicated a possibility that the law could be invalidated on First Amendment grounds.“We couldn’t have entire genres — Latin music of any kind, electronic. We had to censor our music to make sure no one danced,” he said.Opponents of the law have also emphasized its ultimate effect. “When we stop people from dancing, they go straight to these warehouses,” Mr. Barclay said, recalling a recent deadly fire in the Ghost Ship warehouse in Oakland, Calif. “People haven’t stopped dancing, they’re just dancing in these extremely unsafe, unregulated environments.”The advocates testified at hearings, lobbied council members and addressed concerns raised by community boards. “If people are concerned that it’s going to turn into Coachella in their neighborhood, there are departments that are already regulating noise, fire, everything. It’s hyper-regulated,” said Mr. Barclay. “The only thing we are asking is to move our bodies rhythmically. That’s it.”On Friday, Councilman Espinal and about a dozen advocates gathered at Muchmore’s for a pub-crawl in advance of Tuesday’s vote. The group included members of NYC Artist Coalition, Dance Liberation Network, Legalize Dance NYC, and the founder of the annual Dance Parade, which started around a decade ago to protest the law. They carried handouts that said “Let NYC Dance” and “Did you know social dancing is illegal in NYC? It’s enforced on the most vulnerable.”At Bossa Nova Civic Club, people swayed in the haze created by a smoke machine. “You can’t dance in New York?” said Janina Butz, a German fashion designer who lives in Brooklyn. “In Germany, you can’t dance on Easter and I thought that was crazy,” she said.At Happyfun Hideaway, a bar owned by one of the advocates, people bopped in Halloween costumes and Koa Pennock handed out shots of whiskey to friends. “It’s just a bully mentality,” he said of the Cabaret Law.“Remember ‘Footloose’?” asked his friend Beau Becerra, referring to the 1984 film starring Kevin Bacon about a fictional town that forbids dancing. “Like Kevin taught us,” he said, holding up his shot glass for a toast, “we should just dance.”
The Messy Family Battle for Starrett City When the sale of Starrett City, the largest federally subsidized housing complex in the country, was announced last month, it looked like a done deal.The buyers of the massive complex, with its 5,581 apartments, schools, shopping center, power plant and even its own ZIP code, pledged to maintain its affordable rents, a key in getting the government approvals the sale will require. They agreed to pay $905 million to its shareholders, who include President Trump.But in recent weeks, a dissident group has emerged to block the sale, putting the Brooklyn development at the center of a bruising grudge match, and leaving its 15,000 residents uncertain about the future of their home, a working-class oasis of 46 towers spread across 145 well-manicured acres on Jamaica Bay.It is a tale worthy of a soap opera, with the widow of the irascible real estate tycoon who built the project locked in a bitter fight with her four estranged stepchildren over the sale.On one side is Carol G. Deane, managing partner of Starrett City Associates and the widow of Disque D. Deane, who put together the partnership that financed the complex and has owned it for more than four decades.Opposing her is a group composed of one of Mr. Deane’s embattled former partners and four of Mr. Deane’s adult children — Marjorie, Walter, Kathryn and Disque Jr. — who collectively own only 4.4 percent of the Starrett City partnership. They are backed by a rival real estate partnership — LIHC Investment Group and Belveron Partners — that wants to grab the complex for itself, and is willing to pay a slightly higher price.Ms. Deane, Mr. Deane’s third wife, noted in an affidavit that this was not the first time she has tangled with Mr. Deane’s children.Mr. Deane was a shrewd investor who had been a partner at the Lazard Freres investment bank before forming a real estate company. In the early 1970s, he put together the partnership that created Starrett City, an investment that Mr. Trump once described as “probably the greatest tax shelter ever.”Even in a business known for its hard-nosed tactics, Mr. Deane stood out. He kept a stuffed timber wolf in his office as “a reminder that you should always keep your organization lean and hungry,” and he could be an emotionally remote father, who, according to the author Vicky Ward in her book “The Liar’s Ball,” “sporadically beat” his children with his belt.Mr. Deane died at 89 in 2010, leaving his estate to Carol and their two children. Marjorie and Walter Deane, whose mother, Marjorie Schlesinger, had been Mr. Deane’s second wife until, after more than 30 years of marriage, he divorced her to marry Carol, contested the will. They argued that their father had always vowed to treat all of his children equally, but that after their father’s health declined, Carol asserted control over his finances and cut them off.To make matters even more emotionally fraught, Carol had been a friend and college classmate of Mr. Deane’s daughter Marjorie, who felt betrayed by their affair.Mr. Deane did, however, establish sizable trusts for each of his children, which contained shares in Starrett City.Patrick Gerschel, another limited partner in Starrett City, is also part of the dissident group. He declined to comment, but he had a longstanding feud with Mr. Deane dating to the 1970s when they were both partners at Lazard. They publicly fought over the fate of another affordable housing complex, Phipps Plaza West, in 2002.In the current battle, the dissidents contend that Ms. Deane is enriching herself while failing to maximize profits for the shareholders. They say she signed a deal with a single bidder — the Brooksville Company and Rockpoint Group — for less than what the Starrett complex, whose name was officially changed several years ago to Spring Creek Towers, is worth, rather than conducting a proper auction.They also make claims of “secret” payments to Ms. Deane and conflicts of interest.LIHC and Belveron, who jointly accumulated a 12 percent stake in Starrett City in recent years, offered $930 million for Starrett City, after Brooksville and Rockpoint had already signed a purchase agreement for the property.They will have a showdown on Wednesday at a hearing in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.“It’s beyond reason for a sale of this magnitude to forgo some sort of competitive bidding process,” said Kelly Magee, a spokeswoman for the plaintiffs. Ms. Magee argued that without an appraisal, it is impossible to know the true market value of the property. “We believe this kind of closed-door dealing is to the detriment of the many partners who have been part of Starrett City for generations.”Ms. Deane and Starrett City Associates have vehemently denied the accusations in court papers and at a recent hearing. They said that nearly three-quarters of the limited partners have already approved the sale to the Brooksville partnership“We believe the purchasers have provided a fair price and have demonstrated a firm commitment to maintaining long-term affordability and quality of life for our 15,000 residents,” said Bob Liff, a spokesman for Starrett City Associates. “We will vigorously oppose the lawsuit brought by Belveron to block the sale and attempt to seize control of Starrett City.”In June, Ms. Deane notified the limited partners that she was exploring a possible sale because of the complex’s need for major capital repairs, a maturing mortgage and for tax reasons. She hired Douglas Harmon of Cushman & Wakefield to market the property.According to court papers, Ms. Deane wanted to avoid the kind of fiasco that occurred in 2007 when she and her husband tried to sell the property to the highest bidder for $1.3 billion. Tenants, state and city officials, as well as Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, angrily opposed the deal, fearing that anyone who paid such a high price would either slash services or oust longtime tenants or both.The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which had to approve any sale, rejected the deal, describing the buyer as unfit.The partnership subsequently remortgaged the property, enabling the partners to reap about $200 million.This time around, Mr. Harmon recommended that the owners skip an auction and instead target prospective buyers who had both the wherewithal to buy the complex and a likelihood of obtaining governmental approval. Ms. Deane was also intent on getting a deal that would preserve Starrett City as an affordable home for low- and moderate-income families.She also wanted to avoid the noisy media coverage that would accompany the sale of a property in which Mr. Trump is a limited partner, fearing it would could scare off prospective buyers. Mr. Trump inherited his 4 percent stake in the development.Mr. Harmon, the broker, met with a limited group of possible buyers.Belveron had also expressed interest in the property, but Ms. Deane said she was wary, knowing that Belveron’s “playbook was to file lawsuits in an effort to wrest control of large properties from management,” according to her affidavit.Ms. Deane, in her affidavit, said she found Brooksville and Rockpoint’s offer “very attractive.” As the managing partner, she then sought approval in September from the 76 limited partners in Starrett City, who would share in the residual proceeds.Ms. Deane notified them that the managing partner was entitled to 20 percent of the residual proceeds, or at least $80 million under the current deal.The dissidents have described this as a “secret” provision, but it was an amendment approved by the limited partners in 2003.Immediately after the deal was announced, Belveron offered to buy the property for $25 million more than Brooksville and Rockpoint offered. It also says it wants to preserve Starrett City as affordable housing, though LIHC has clashed with tenants at some Manhattan developments.Rebuffed, Belveron and their allies went to court to stop the sale, claiming that Ms. Deane had ignored a “superior offer” in breach of her fiduciary duty, after conducting a sale “in a hasty and opaque manner that is rived with conflicts of interest.”The dissidents’ law firm commissioned their own appraisal earlier this month that pegged the value of the property at almost $1.2 billion, although the assessment was conducted without an “interior inspection of any of the buildings.”The pending sale has sent a current of anxiety through Starrett City, where residents worry about the possible effect on the quality of life and long-term affordability of the complex. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat, and other elected officials have assured tenants that their concerns will be addressed.Mr. Jeffries said that Brooksville had done a good job so far in communicating with residents. But, he said, any argument that a buyer had not paid enough money would raise suspicions about gentrification and luxury development at some time in the future.“That’s obviously of great concern,” he said.
The War of Independence, Seen Through Six Sets of Eyes REVOLUTION SONG A Story of American Freedom By Russell Shorto 512 pp. W.W. Norton & Company. $28.95.“There is properly no history, only biography,” Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. Russell Shorto, in his new book “Revolution Song,” seems to be of similar mind. He writes about six people, all of whom lived in the Revolutionary era, but he does not roll them up into a single narrative or use their lives to bolster an overarching thesis. Instead, he artfully weaves their stories together and leaves it to the reader to draw conclusions. “I have tried not to preach or even teach,” Shorto writes in the preface — and it proves a decidedly refreshing approach.Shorto has an eye for intriguing subjects (his previous books include “Amsterdam,” “Descartes’ Bones” and “The Island at the Center of the World”), and this book is no exception. The Seneca chief Cornplanter (or Kayethwahkeh in Seneca) was a fine looking, philosophically minded man who was also, in Shorto’s words, “something of a killing machine.” Allied with England during the Revolution, Cornplanter and his warriors slaughtered patriot soldiers and civilians, even children. In retaliation, George Washington sent an invasion force that destroyed crops and leveled village upon village, killing and scalping along the way.The war devastated the Senecas, and afterward Cornplanter counseled accommodation, urging his people to learn English and know something of white ways. But as the Senecas lost more territory, they grew increasingly hostile to white culture. A message came to Cornplanter from the Creator, telling him to “remove from his house and sight every article of the workmanship or invention of the white man.” He destroyed mementos, including a sword that had been a gift from Washington, and gradually withdrew from the wider world.Shorto concludes with the optimistic side of the Creator’s message, describing ancestral lands and ancient ways that Cornplanter, having thrown off white culture, could dream of once more. But the conclusion to Cornplanter’s story is actually very sad. Although the United States government guaranteed in 1794 that the Seneca grant where Cornplanter was buried would never be taken, in 1964 it was. The Army Corps of Engineers moved his remains and those of hundreds of Senecas buried near him in order to construct a dam on the Allegheny River.Another of Shorto’s subjects is Margaret Moncrieffe Coghlan, a dark-haired beauty who wrote a delightfully scandalous memoir. Some scholars have thought it a forgery, but Shorto argues that it is not, and without doubt it is a good read. Coghlan’s father, a British officer assigned to the United States during the Revolution, forced her at age 14 to marry the British lieutenant John Coghlan, probably to put an end to her dalliance with Aaron Burr. She detested her husband, ran away and availed herself of an English lord, whereupon her father sent her to a nunnery. After she escaped, he disowned her.A string of lovers supported her passion for fine things, but one had gambling debts that mounted until he could not afford to pay her bills. Debtors’ prison was looming when her false death notice appeared in the newspapers. But soon she reappeared in Paris, and the pattern of lovers and debtors’ prison resumed. Then she disappeared from the historical record, leaving behind a mystery: Did she die in prison? Or did she get away with faking her own death once more?Both Cornplanter and Margaret Coghlan met George Washington. It was otherwise for Venture Smith (whose Western African name was Broteer Furro). Brought to New England as a slave when he was a boy, he grew into a formidable man, over six feet tall, 300 pounds, and amazingly strong. He was of steady temper, though he could be pushed too far. When one master and his brother beat him, Smith stacked them on top of each other and stomped both at the same time.Smith’s son Cuff marched with George Washington, but Smith himself was too absorbed in making a life for his wife and children to participate in the Revolution. By persuading one of his masters to hire him out, he earned the money to buy freedom for himself and his family and to invest in land, including a parcel in Connecticut where he built a three-level home, a barn and a forge. Although he never learned to write, he was adept at complex financial transactions and willingly used his skill to help other free blacks establish themselves.In old age, stooped and blind, Smith was proud of his achievements but bitter about the obstacles he had faced because he was black. Still, he found reason for gratitude. “My freedom,” he said, “is a privilege which nothing else can equal.”Closer to the Revolution was Abraham Yates, a shoemaker of deceptively meek appearance who educated himself in the law and, with help from the future New Jersey governor William Livingston, broke through New York’s ruling clans to become an influential politician. During the war he served in New York’s Provincial Congress, helped write New York’s Constitution and corresponded with Washington. Afterward, convinced that the United States Constitution was written for the privileged few, he threw himself into defeating its ratification. Losing the battle did little to deter him, and in the last years of his life, he was still defending the rights of the common man.In a portrait painted by George Romney, Lord George Germain, another of Shorto’s subjects, wears a silver wig and red jacket. England’s secretary of state for the American colonies has a hint of hauteur about him, but also a sense of doubt.He may be wondering whether England will defeat the American rebels. Should that fail to happen, Germain would never recover the reputation he’d lost some 20 years before when he had been court-martialed for purportedly refusing a direct order.As it turned out, Germain’s anxiety was justified. In 1781, it was his duty to deliver news of the American victory at Yorktown to the prime minister, Lord North, who cried out, “Oh God, it is all over!”George Washington is the hub of Shorto’s book, the figure with whom almost everyone else directly connects. Cornplanter sought his help for the Senecas. Coghlan attended a dinner at which he was present and got his attention when she saucily refused to toast the American cause. Yates exchanged letters with him. Germain was his opponent, and, like Washington, a tall, imposing man who hid vast ambition behind a usually unreadable visage. Shorto captures this resemblance, as well as the noble demeanor that separated Washington from nearly everyone else.But like many who have written about Washington, Shorto has difficulty describing the president’s inner life. As his soldiers became more professional, Shorto writes, Washington “found himself overcome with emotion, thrilling in his heart at the feeling that he was becoming one with them.” Such a description deserves an example — or at least a footnote. The same is true when Shorto writes that while living in New York as the new president, Washington felt like a “bumpkin.” Perhaps, but where is the proof?Still, Shorto’s achievement is a remarkable one. The intertwined stories of “Revolution Song” give a sense of how far-reaching a phenomenon the War of Independence was. It leaves to readers the pleasure of judging what each of the figures in the book — or perhaps the combination of them all — contributed to an event that changed the world.
Loss of Federal Protections May Imperil Pacific Reefs, Scientists Warn HONOLULU — Terry Kerby has been piloting deep-sea submarines for four decades, but nothing prepared him for the devastation he observed recently on several underwater mountains called seamounts in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.“It was a biological desert,” he said. Where normally fish and crabs dart about forests of coral and sponges, “all we could can see was a parking lot full of nets and lines, with no life at all.”Mr. Kerby and Brendan Roark, a geographer at Texas A&M University, are comparing seamounts that have been fished to those in pristine, protected areas. This month, they surveyed the upper reaches of four seamounts, one of which, Hancock, lies inside Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, which includes the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.They knew that the seamounts had been fished by trawlers and coral harvesters at some point. “But the extent of the devastation and the huge amount of gear that was abandoned on the bottom were shocking for both of us,” he said.Among the casualties littering the seabed were 10-foot-tall black corals that can live over 4,000 years, among the oldest forms of life on earth.“Allowing fishing in the few protected seamounts left would be a huge mistake,” said Dr. Roark.It’s a sentiment widely shared among marine ecologists.The Trump administration is considering rolling back federal protections for 10 national monuments, including two in the central Pacific. The Pacific Remote Islands National Marine Monument and the Rose Atoll National Marine Monument protect the waters around a handful of islands, most uninhabited, to the south of the Hawaiian Islands.The shore reefs of the islands have long been protected from commercial fishing; the monument designations extended that protection to 50 miles from shore in some cases and 200 miles in others.According to a memo obtained by The Washington Post in September, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has recommended that the designations of the Pacific Remote Islands and the Rose Atoll be amended “to allow commercial fishing.” (A similar recommendation was made for another marine monument, the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts, off the coast of New England.)The memo did not mention the largest marine reserve: Papahānaumokuākea, a string of mostly uninhabited atolls and reefs that have been largely undisturbed since World War II. At about 583,000 square miles, it is the largest protected area on the planet. (Industry officials in Hawaii are pressing for commercial fishing to be allowed there, too.)Many scientists see these marine reserves as among the last rich, untouched ecosystems where they can study the effects of climate change in isolation from the impacts of overfishing or pollution.The fishing industry here in Hawaii sees it differently. A driving force behind the administration’s reconsideration is an obscure but powerful quasi-governmental organization called the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council, or Wespac, based in Honolulu. The council has jurisdiction over the waters where 140 long-line vessels based in Hawaii — as well as a handful in American Samoa — fish mostly for tuna and billfish.Wespac has argued that limits on catch, gear and fishing seasons are the best tools to regulate fishing and to ensure that the Pacific yields the maximum sustainable harvests. Over the years, the council has strongly opposed the creation and expansions of each of the marine monuments.This year, the council has embraced a new slogan: “Make America Great Again: Return U.S. fishermen to U.S. waters.” In a presentation to members of the other fisheries councils in February, Wespac officials claimed the marine monuments “curtailed economic growth” and “compromised national food security.”Ray Hilborn, a fisheries expert at the University of Washington and a scientific adviser to Wespac, argues that tuna and billfish are highly migratory and travel in and out of the reserves. “The monuments just force the fishermen to go farther and spend more fuel to catch the same fish,” he said in an interview. “It’s a fake protection.”Asked whether Wespac sought to reintroduce fishing only in monument waters or also in near-shore reefs, Kitty Simonds, the longtime executive director, said in an email that the council also would review “the management measures that were in place before the monument designation and may recommend changes.”The fishing industry in Hawaii is hardly in trouble, several experts noted. Indeed, the Hawaii fleet’s bigeye tuna catch has doubled since 2006, even though half of America’s Pacific waters are now off-limits to fishing.Robert Richmond, a marine ecologist at the University of Hawaii, pointed out that the Hawaii fleet filled its yearly quota of bigeye in August this year, “so they obviously don’t need more space to fish. They’re just against all protected areas on principle.”Over 500 million people depend on reefs for protein, Dr. Richmond said, and they already yield far less than they could if they were sustainably fished. Reef ecosystems may become even less productive as the ocean gets warmer and more acidic.Dr. Richmond and other scientists also took issue with Dr. Hilborn’s criticism of marine monuments. They say the reserves serve as havens for species depleted elsewhere and for populations migrating away from the Equator, where warming waters are lowering plankton density.“The fisheries benefits of marine reserves are now beyond doubt,” Callum Roberts, a marine conservation biologist at the University of York, said in an email. “They allow fish populations to grow back and spill fish into surrounding waters, they pour fountains of offspring into ocean currents that seed fisheries, and they provide resilience to environmental shocks.”The tools favored by fisheries officials target a few species to the neglect of others, he added, while “reserve benefits reach entire ecosystems.”One of the islands on Mr. Zinke’s list is Palmyra, an atoll that lies 1,000 miles south of Hawaii and is part of the Pacific Remote Islands National Marine Monument. The Nature Conservancy has been running a marine lab there since 2005, the only site with housing and a runway for small aircraft located in one of the most untouched tropical marine ecosystems in the world.With 170 inches of rain a year — compared with 37 in Seattle — Palmyra also has a dense rain forest where 11 species of seabirds nest. Discoveries made there include a surprising link between fish and seabirds: a study found that nesting birds’ droppings carried onto the reef by the rain stimulated plankton growth that attracted manta rays and other plankton feeders.Other research has shown that the classic picture of a coral reef, with lots of pretty little fish and a few big ones, is entirely artificial. Palmyra’s reefs, like those in the other monuments, are dominated by sharks, snappers, jacks and other top predators, while smaller prey cower in fear in holes in the coral, a study found.So interconnected are the elements of intact reef communities that allowing fishing just beyond 12 miles would disrupt the ecosystem, said Alan Friedlander, a marine ecologist at the University of Hawaii and chief scientist of the National Geographic Society’s Pristine Seas project.“You need to keep the fishing as far away as possible, ideally at 200 miles,” said Dr. Friedlander.Moreover, the remote locations are difficult to police. Many of the denizens of intact tropical reefs, like humphead parrotfish and wrasses, are worth thousands of dollars in Asia, said Dr. Richmond.“Fishing them sustainably, as Wespac proposes, would mean traveling very long distances from Hawaii and taking very few fish,” he said. “It wouldn’t be economical.” Dr. Richmond predicted that fishing vessels “would poach the heck out of those islands.”Daniel Pauly, a prominent fisheries scientist at the University of British Columbia, says that given a chance, the value of the bigger reserves like those around Wake and Johnston atolls and Jarvis Island, which extend to 200 miles offshore, will increase over time.Why? Evolution.Research by Jonathan A. Mee, a fish geneticist at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta, suggests that in any large marine reserve, some “lazy” fish will spend their whole lives inside the boundaries and therefore will not be caught — and the bigger the reserve, the more fish inside it will live longer.This will raise the number of what scientists call B.O.F.F.s (Big Old Fecund Females), which produce more eggs and eggs of better quality, further increasing the density of fish inside the reserve. Dr. Mee believes that evolutionary selection of a putative “lazy” gene would accelerate the population growth inside a reserve.“The bigger the mortality outside the reserve, the faster the population inside will grow,” Dr. Mee said in an interview.This would be particularly helpful for bigeye tuna, which is the mainstay of the sushi market and the principal target of the Hawaii long-line fleet. The population of bigeye in the central and western Pacific is now estimated to be 16 percent of its original size.“Technology and subsidies have allowed industrial fleets to go farther and farther, and deeper and deeper, and to deplete stock after stock,” said Dr. Pauly, who has shown that the global catch is steadily falling.“The only thing standing between these fleets and global depletion are these big no-take reserves, so this is the time to create more, not to open up the existing ones to fishing.”Alex David Rogers, a conservation biologist and seamount expert at Oxford University, estimated that worldwide there were about 16,000 seamounts with summits above 5,000 feet, shallow enough to harbor a rich diversity of fish and corals. Unfortunately, he said, most have already been fished.Still, those seamounts in the Papahānaumokuākea and Pacific Remote Islands marine monuments remain mostly pristine, said Chris Yesson, an expert on ocean floors at the Zoological Society of London.“Saving the ones in the American marine monuments is extremely important, because the NW Pacific is particularly rich in endemic corals and other marine life,” Dr. Rogers wrote in an email.Paul Achitoff, managing attorney for Earthjustice’s mid-Pacific office in Honolulu, said many legal scholars had concluded that the Antiquities Act, which allows presidents to designate and protect monuments without congressional approval, is a one-way street.“It does not allow presidents to remove restrictions or protections from a previously designated monument,” he said in an interview. “Only Congress can do that.”He acknowledged that several presidents had changed monument boundaries and tweaked restrictions without court challenges.That may change soon. “If any of the protections to the Pacific marine monuments are lifted, we will be filing lawsuits, and we expect to win,” Mr. Achitoff said.
In Court and Out, a de Blasio Donor Is Branded a Liar The attacks have come at news conferences and in court, framed as questions or asserted as fact. But no matter their form, the salvos against the credibility of Jona S. Rechnitz, a donor to Mayor Bill de Blasio who says he bought access to the mayor and other city officials, have shared a single premise:“Mr. Rechnitz, you are a liar, correct?”That most recent iteration of the accusation came on Monday from Henry Mazurek, a defense lawyer in a federal corruption trial in which Mr. Rechnitz is a key government witness.Over the past three days of testimony in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Rechnitz has made explosive claims about how he traded gifts and donations for political favors and influence. And over the past few days, Mr. Rechnitz’s credibility has come under vigorous, often vitriolic attack, as both defense lawyers and the mayor have sought to undermine him in the court of law as well as in the court of public opinion.On Sunday, Mr. de Blasio — whom Mr. Rechnitz said he spoke to weekly during the mayor’s 2013 campaign — called his former donor a liar and a felon. The mayor’s comments, at an unrelated announcement about storm protection in the Rockaways, echoed his remarks from the day before, when he called Mr. Rechnitz a “horrible human being.”Mr. Rechnitz’s claims come at an inconvenient time for Mr. de Blasio, with the mayoral election on Nov. 7. But even if the allegations do not harm the mayor’s re-election prospects — Mr. de Blasio holds a commanding lead in the polls — they have brought a political headache back to life, with the mayor’s photo splashed across the city’s tabloids all weekend.Mr. Rechnitz, a wealthy real estate scion, and his friend Jeremy Reichberg were key figures in federal and state inquiries into pay-to-play accusations against Mr. de Blasio. Prosecutors eventually decided not to bring charges — a fact Mr. de Blasio repeatedly highlighted on Sunday.“The federal government looked at this in excruciating detail, but you somehow want to elevate a criminal to the front pages as having equal validity to federal prosecutors,” he told reporters. “If you want to do that, feel free.”In court, defense lawyers were equally aggressive in their efforts to erode Mr. Rechnitz’s credibility.Mr. Rechnitz, who pleaded guilty to a fraud conspiracy charge, is cooperating with the government in its case against Norman Seabrook, the former head of the city’s correction officers’ union, and Murray Huberfeld, a hedge fund financier accused of bribing him. But Mr. Mazurek, Mr. Huberfeld’s lawyer, sought to show that Mr. Rechnitz lied to investigators both before and after he signed his cooperation agreement — and perhaps continued to lie on Monday on the witness stand.When Mr. Mazurek asked Mr. Rechnitz about statements he had made to federal agents claiming not to remember whether he had sex with a prostitute aboard a private jet he chartered for several police officers, Mr. Rechnitz denied ever making those statements. In response, Mr. Mazurek read aloud the agents’ report on the statements.“I never said that,” Mr. Rechnitz said.Mr. Rechnitz made no effort to endear himself to jurors. He was alternately combative, flip and sullen. When asked to confirm answers he had given just days before, he often declined to give a straightforward answer.“If you say so,” he said once, or, “It could be I said those words, sure.”“I had lied to investigators until I came forward and told them the truth,” he said at another point.And there was this bit of verbal acrobatics:“Are you able to tell the difference between the truth and a lie?” Mr. Mazurek asked.“I don’t understand the question,” Mr. Rechnitz replied.Several times, Mr. Rechnitz’s responses elicited audible reactions from audience members, prompting a warning from Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr.Most notably, Mr. Mazurek highlighted a conversation Mr. Rechnitz had with federal agents when he was being questioned about his involvement with city police officers, whom he has admitted showering with gifts in order to secure favors. Mr. Rechnitz had initially told investigators that he had sought relationships with officers because, as the grandson of Holocaust survivors, he was taught to befriend law enforcement officials to “help ensure the mistakes of the past were not repeated,” Mr. Mazurek said.“I was trying to wiggle my way out of the truth,” Mr. Rechnitz said.“And you invoked the memory of the Holocaust to wiggle your way out of the truth?” Mr. Mazurek said.“It sounds that way, yes,” Mr. Rechnitz responded.
Afghan War Data, Once Public, Is Censored in U.S. Military Report WASHINGTON — The American military command in Afghanistan has decided to keep secret key figures related to the growth and progress of local security forces, redacting the numbers at the behest of Afghan officials from the latest report by the government’s watchdog for spending.The move clouds measures of progress for the Afghan security forces, the primary benefactor of the $120 billion that the United States has spent on reconstruction since the start of the war and the linchpin of President Trump’s new strategy in Afghanistan. Backed by the American military and its NATO allies, the Afghans are responsible for turning the tide of the war against the Taliban in the coming years.Among the details being kept private in the report are the number of people in the Afghan army and police force, how many of them have been wounded or killed and the state of their equipment.“The Afghans know what’s going on; the Taliban knows what’s going on; the U.S. military knows what’s going on,” John F. Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan, whose office compiled the quarterly report, said in an interview. “The only people who don’t know what’s going on are the people paying for it.”Capt. Tom Gresback of the Navy, the spokesman for American forces in Afghanistan, defended the decision to classify the information, saying that it was done at the Afghan government’s request.Mr. Sopko said: “The government usually doesn’t classify good news. I don’t want any nameless, faceless Afghan bureaucrat telling the American taxpayer what they ought to know.”The information has been classified only once before, in 2015, as the Obama administration was trying to portray the war in Afghanistan as all but over. At the time, as Taliban militants surged across the country, officials said that the figures, if made public, could endanger Afghan and American lives.While the quarterly reports have had a classified annex since 2015, most of the data categories redacted in the latest release have been available to the public since the inspector general started putting out the reports in 2008.This time, the numbers were kept secret as Mr. Trump ramps up the conflict, authorizing the deployment of thousands more troops and an expanded C.I.A. paramilitary campaign as well as overseeing a volume of airstrikes not seen since 2012.Mr. Sopko’s report includes nine questions — answered publicly in the past — that have now been redacted, including the exact number of Afghan forces serving.The number of combat casualties among the Afghan military and police, the primary forces battling Taliban and Islamic State militants in the country, were also classified.The total is one of the clearest indications of the ferocity of the war. From the beginning of the year through May 8, 2,531 members of the Afghan security forces were killed and 4,238 wounded, Mr. Sopko’s report in July said, adding that the Pentagon said Afghan casualties have “steadily increased.”That compares with more than 6,700 deaths among the Afghan security forces for all last year and around 12,000 wounded.The death tolls could hurt the morale of the troops and police as well as the government’s efforts to recruit for the roughly 330,000-member force. Long a problem for the Afghan army, the average attrition rate dropped from January to March, according to the previous inspector general report.In April, the equipment readiness for the six Afghan Corps — the largest organizational unit in the Afghan military at about 18,000 troops — ranged from 42 to 86 percent.The numbers are important bellwethers for the 16-year war effort, one that has been marked by military setbacks and a Taliban militancy that has held on — and even gained ground — despite the group’s technological disadvantage.It is unclear whether the American military will move to classify more information in future reports, said Mr. Sopko, as some of the redactions in the October report seemed arbitrary.“If they start classifying this stuff now, what are they going to do next month?” Mr. Sopko asked. “It’s a slippery slope.”
As Open Enrollment for Obamacare Begins, Confusion Reigns MACON, Ga. — David Branch knew that his job, helping people sign up for Obamacare, would be harder this year. But Mr. Branch didn’t fully realize the scope of his challenge until a group that he approached with his fliers insisted that the Affordable Care Act had been repealed.“They said: ‘Why are you guys here? Obamacare is done,’ ” Mr. Branch recalled Friday as he finished a training session here.In fact, the Affordable Care Act has survived blow after blow since President Trump took office in January, including repeated attempts by Congress to repeal it. But as the fifth open enrollment period starts Wednesday, the law is reeling from continued attacks by Mr. Trump that have sown confusion and anxiety among the roughly 10 million Americans with coverage through its insurance marketplaces and millions more who remain uninsured.Most recently, Mr. Trump announced plans to cut off subsidies that reimburse insurance companies for assistance they are required to provide to  low-income customers who struggle with co-payments and deductibles. The cuts resulted in a crazy quilt of premiums for 2018 that differs radically from the pattern of the last four years, which will upend expectations of consumers in many states.And the administration’s sharp cuts to advertising for the law’s open enrollment period and to groups that employ enrollment “navigators” like Mr. Branch have almost certainly limited public awareness that now is the time to enroll. Those who have heard Mr. Trump’s message that insurance premiums are way up may not realize that the subsidies that help low- and middle-income Americans pay those premiums will rise as well.The enrollment period for the federal marketplace has been cut in half, to 45 days, with hardly any publicity by federal officials. No one is sure how well government call centers and computer systems will handle the expected surge of applications leading up to the Dec. 15 deadline for people to enroll through HealthCare.gov.In Washington and across the nation, supporters of the law are doing what they can to combat misperceptions.“Consumers are unclear whether the marketplaces still exist, whether they still have an obligation to get coverage, whether the mandate exists, whether they can get financial assistance,” said Kelley Turek, a policy analyst at America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group. “Our message is: Come back. The marketplaces are still here.”Here in Georgia, what had been the largest navigator group, Insure Georgia, lost 86 percent of its $2.3 million federal grant and had to lay off half its staff, leaving Mr. Branch and 10 other counselors to provide enrollment assistance for all 159 counties in the state. Humana is leaving the insurance marketplace here, and while three other insurers will remain, all but 10 counties will have a single company selling coverage for next year. Rates for popular silver-level “benchmark” plans are rising by 47 percent on average here, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, although most customers will qualify for subsidies that will grow by a similar amount. The department found that premiums for benchmark plans are increasing by 37 percent nationwide, compared with 24 percent last year.Other types of plans may be less expensive, because to compensate for the funds they will lose now that Mr. Trump has ended the cost-sharing payments, insurers have generally raised the price of silver plans more than those in the bronze, gold and platinum categories. As a result, some gold plans will now be less expensive than some silver plans, even though gold plans cover more of the costs of a typical consumer.Sorting through these complications will be difficult for many consumers.At a Halloween “safety expo” at Coliseum Medical Centers here on Saturday, several hundred parents and children filed past an Insure Georgia table by the front door, where Amber Higgins, another navigator, asked over and over, “Do y’all have health insurance? You know anyone who’s doing without it?”“My niece who just moved here from Ohio,” said one woman, taking a flier.“My sister in Texas,” said another.“Me,” said yet another woman, scanning the income requirements for receiving subsidies, which Ms. Higgins had placed in a frame.The response was not surprising. Georgia has the nation’s fourth-highest number of uninsured residents, after Texas, California and Florida. In some of the state’s rural counties, enrollment under the Affordable Care Act dropped by as much as 36 percent this year, according to a new report, which pointed to the diminishing choice of insurers in rural areas as a likely reason.Briana Zoellick, 26, told Ms. Higgins she had checked the HealthCare.gov website when it started allowing people to preview their options last week and was astonished to learn that her family’s subsidy would be a lot bigger next year even though their income has risen. Ms. Zoellick, a medical assistant and mother of two, said she and her husband, a graphic designer, canceled their coverage earlier this year because they could not afford their portion of the premium, about $140 a month.Next year, she has learned, their subsidy will rise to more than $800, from $650 — “incredible,” she said — and their share will be less than before.Yet Ms. Zoellick said her husband remained wary of signing up because of everything he had heard about Mr. Trump ending the payments to insurers. Many customers are mistakenly assuming that what he is blocking is premium subsidies, which are separate and not affected by Mr. Trump’s action.“He was like, ‘I don’t know if that’s going to actually happen because of what Trump’s doing,’ ” Ms. Zoellick said, referring to their higher subsidy.The California marketplace, run by an independent state agency, is spending $111 million on advertising, more than 10 times as much as the federal government intends to spend for the entire country. The New York marketplace, run by the state Health Department, is spending $15 million.“Despite attempts at the federal level to take health care from New Yorkers, our marketplace is ready to open Nov. 1 as strong as ever,” said Donna Frescatore, the executive director of the New York insurance marketplace. “For many consumers, prices in 2018 will be the same as this year, or lower for the same level plan.”In some states that run their own insurance exchanges, consumers will have more time to sign up. The deadline is Jan. 14 in Minnesota, Jan. 15 in Washington State and Jan. 31 in California and New York.While many consumers will have fewer choices and will face higher premiums next year, the situation varies greatly from state to state.In Tulsa, Okla., seven health plans will be available, all from one company. For the most popular plans, the average premium for a 35-year-old will be about $560 a month, according to HealthCare.gov. In Phoenix, consumers will have a choice of five plans, all from one company. For the two popular silver plans, premiums for a 35-year-old average $470 a month.Mike Kreidler, the insurance commissioner in Washington State, approved rate increases averaging 36 percent last week, and he attributed 10 percentage points of the increase to Mr. Trump’s decision to cut off the subsidies known as cost-sharing reduction payments.“I fear that many will go uninsured,” Mr. Kreidler said, while noting that some plans would not be affected by the president’s action.In Macon next year, 13 plans will be available, all from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia. A 50-year-old woman with income of $30,000 will be eligible for a subsidy of $597 a month. That subsidy would lower her premium to an average of $236 a month for silver plans and $77 a month for bronze plans, according to HealthCare.gov.But for a 50-year-old woman in Macon with annual income of $50,000, costs would be much higher. She would not be eligible for financial assistance and would have to pay $768 a month — more than 18 percent of her income — for the cheapest silver plan. Prices in rural southwest Georgia and a few other parts of the state will be even higher, although in Atlanta they will be lower.For Pat and John Curry of Augusta, who are both 57 and own a small coffee-roasting business, options will range next year from a bronze plan for $1,526 a month with a $13,500 family deductible to a gold plan for $3,142 a month and a $3,900 family deductible. Blue Cross is the only insurer selling in their county. The couple, who each have chronic conditions and take multiple daily medications, said they would research whether buying a plan directly from Blue Cross would be cheaper.Ms. Curry will also consider buying coverage only for her husband, who is getting follow-up care for cancer.“I don’t know what we’ll be doing for insurance,” Ms. Curry said, looking at rates under the Affordable Care Act, “but it won’t be this.”
Ex-Leader of Catalonia, in Brussels, Lays His Crisis Before a Wary Europe BRUSSELS — The deposed leader of Catalonia said on Tuesday that he had traveled to Brussels to guarantee a fair trial for himself and other separatists who declared independence from Spain last week, but that they were not seeking asylum.Instead, the former leader, Carles Puigdemont, said he had left Catalonia as Madrid took over administration of his region to put Spain’s territorial conflict “in the institutional heart of Europe.”“We are here because Brussels is the capital of Europe, it is not a question of Belgian politics,” Mr. Puigdemont said in his first public remarks since the Spanish authorities called on Monday for him and 19 other separatists to be prosecuted for rebellion.“This is a European issue,” Mr. Puigdemont told a news conference, “and I want Europe to react.”Mr. Puigdemont’s wishes are unlikely to be granted. Brussels is the headquarters of the European Union, but the bloc is a group of sovereign states in a time of increased nationalism on the continent.Some European Union leaders have urged dialogue, but all have fully supported Spanish sovereignty and the Spanish government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and shown no sympathy for Catalan secession.On Friday, Jean-Claude Juncker, the most pro-European of European leaders, said bluntly that the European Union “doesn’t need any more cracks, more splits.”Mr. Juncker, the president of the European Commission and himself from tiny Luxembourg, said that the bloc should not intervene in “an internal debate for Spain, but I wouldn’t want the European Union to consist of 95 member states in the future.”After Catalan separatists declared independence last Friday, Mr. Rajoy dismissed Mr. Puigdemont and his cabinet and dissolved the Catalan Parliament, calling for regional elections on Dec. 21.In Brussels, Mr. Puigdemont welcomed the chance for separatists to win the December elections. He said he would “accept the results” and called on Madrid to make “a clear commitment” to do the same.Mr. Puigdemont emphasized that he was not escaping Spanish justice, but he said he wanted guarantees of a fair trial and would work for now from Brussels, in “freedom and security.”After reading the charges proposed by the Spanish attorney general, Mr. Puigdemont said he felt Catalan politicians would not be treated fairly by the Spanish judiciary.The possible charges, he argued, amounted to “a persecution” of people and their ideas rather than specific crimes. “More than a desire for justice, it is a desire for vengeance,” he said.While he ruled out asking for political asylum from Belgium, he could do so in the future, especially if Spain seeks his arrest and extradition.Hours after Mr. Puigdemont’s criticism of Spain’s judiciary, Carmen Lamela, a judge from the country’s national court, summoned him and the rest of his ousted cabinet to appear before her in Madrid on Thursday.Mr. Puigdemont’s Belgian lawyer, Paul Bekaert, said that “as long as the possibility exists that Spain asks to extradite Puigdemont, it can’t be excluded that he applies for political asylum.”Mr. Bekaert, 68, who specializes in asylum cases, has worked in the past for Basque separatists who sought asylum here to avoid trial on terrorism charges in Spain. He said he didn’t know how long Mr. Puigdemont would stay.“He came here to work in total peace and security,” Mr. Bekaert said. “In the meantime, we are on standby.”Earlier, Mr. Bekaert told Flemish Radio: “As a citizen of the European Union, he can in fact apply for political asylum here. Whether he obtains it is another question.”Mr. Puigdemont’s presence in Brussels was intended to add a European dimension to Spain’s most serious political crisis in decades. He is in effect proposing to lead his ousted Catalan government from a city that is home to the main institutions of the European Union, which has been unsympathetic to the push for secession, and is in a country that has its own separatist tensions.So wary is Belgium of Mr. Puigdemont and his movement that it prevented him from holding his news conference in a government-owned building.More important, however, the European Union is also wary of Mr. Puigdemont, whose appeal to a Europe of “democracy, liberty, free expression and nonviolence,” as he put it, indicated a romantic view of the bloc.The Catalan separatists appear swept up in an earlier concept of a European Union of shared sovereignties, where regional identities can merge with a vague European identity and somehow supersede national ones.That view has become outdated in a bloc under severe nationalist strains stemming from the debt crisis, the migration wave, the fear of terrorism and the populism that all of those anxieties have engendered.Not least, a larger bloc of 28 very different nations has grown more sensitive than in many decades to the sanctity of their borders.The European Union, facing the loss of Britain, has no desire to enlarge further or to create more fissures. Already anxious about Scotland’s previous calls for independence, states like France, Italy and even Belgium have no interest in encouraging regional secessionist movements in places like Corsica, Lombardy, South Tyrol and Flanders.And Spain, with a strongly recovering economy, is considered a model of democratic transformation after the Franco era under the umbrella and tutelage of the European Union. A Spanish failure would be perceived as a European one, just as Brussels feels that the bloc is regaining some of its confidence.Mr. Puigdemont and several members of his ousted cabinet made their way to Brussels on Monday just as the Spanish attorney general, José Manuel Maza, announced in Madrid that Mr. Puigdemont and other separatist leaders should appear “urgently” in court there.Those in Brussels may avoid the Spanish courts, but they will not find much support from any European Union official. And even as Mr. Puigdemont and others sat tight in Brussels, the Spanish Supreme Court summoned a handful of other Catalan lawmakers to appear in Madrid on Thursday, including Carme Forcadell, the president of the Catalan Parliament who read out the declaration of independence last week.Mr. Maza chose not to order the immediate arrest of the separatists, but he wants judges to allow him to pursue charges of rebellion, sedition and the misuse of public funds against those who organized and carried out an illegal independence referendum on Oct. 1.On Tuesday, Mr. Puigdemont said the length of his Brussels stay was dependent “on the circumstances.”“If we could be guaranteed that the trial would be fair,” he said, “without doubt I would return immediately.”Had he and his entire cabinet stayed in Barcelona this week, he said, “with an attitude of resistance, there would have been a very violent reaction by the state,” he argued.Mr. Puigdemont said he had not been negotiating with Belgian politicians. “I don’t ask anything from Belgian politicians, except as part of European politics,” he said.Instead, he repeated his call for the European Union to step into the conflict, a plea that has been rejected by European leaders. “To the international community and especially Europe, I ask them to react,” he said.While he waits, the national government in Madrid took direct administrative control of Catalonia, using emergency constitutional powers invoked by Mr. Rajoy.Mr. Puigdemont called on Catalan citizens to oppose the dismantling of Catalonia’s institutions, while officials in Madrid welcomed the news that Mr. Puigdemont had chosen to leave Spain rather than remain in Barcelona and resist the national government’s decision to oust him.
Airbus Says It Misled State Department on Arms Sales The aircraft manufacturer Airbus said on Tuesday that it may have violated United States rules on arms exports, potentially expanding a corruption investigation that has already shaken the company in Europe.Airbus, Boeing’s main rival in the passenger jet business, said that it had provided false information to the State Department about its compliance with rules on arms sales overseas. Airbus provided few details except to say that the inaccuracies related to American regulations on fees and commissions paid to sales agents.The disclosure raised the prospect that corruption investigations involving the company in Europe, to do with the use of middlemen to pay bribes, could spread to the United States, which typically imposes much higher fines and stiffer court judgments. In an industry that relies heavily on ties with government, Airbus could also be at a disadvantage competing for contracts, or even be frozen out altogether.Airbus, based in Toulouse, France, is under investigation by the British and French authorities for possible use of intermediaries to pay bribes related to the sale of commercial aircraft. In addition, the German and Austrian authorities are investigating bribery allegations tied to the sale of Eurofighter jets to Austria in 2003. Airbus also has a unit in Columbus, Miss., that makes helicopters for civilian and military buyers.In its quarterly financial report on Tuesday, Airbus warned that penalties from the European investigations could have a significant effect on its finances. The company said that net profit from July through September rose sevenfold to 348 million euros, or $405 million, mainly because of favorable currency exchange rates. Sales rose 2 percent to €14.2 billion.The false information sent to the State Department was related to defense products or services, but the company did not say which kind. A company spokesman declined to comment on Tuesday.Airbus said it discovered the false reporting during an internal review and volunteered the information to the State Department.“Following a review of its U.S. regulatory compliance procedures,” the company said in a statement, “Airbus has discovered and subsequently informed relevant U.S. authorities of its findings concerning certain inaccuracies in filings made with the U.S. Department of State.” The company said it was cooperating with the United States authorities.Airbus shares rose as much as 3.7 percent in midday trading in Paris on Tuesday. The French, German and Spanish governments own about 26 percent of the shares and the rest are traded publicly.
Manus Island Refugees, Ordered to Leave Camp, Fear for Their Safety SYDNEY, Australia — Australia moved forward with plans to close its Manus Island detention center in Papua New Guinea on Tuesday, cutting off access to food, water and electricity as more than 600 refugees and asylum seekers resisted relocation to a nearby city, where they said they would be attacked.“We are extremely frightened and anxious at the moment,” said Imran Mohammad, 23, a Rohingya migrant from Myanmar, who was detained on Manus after trying to reach Australia by boat. “We are not safe and not welcomed into the local community. If we stay at the center we are at risk, and if we leave, we will be in danger.”Tensions over the fate of the refugees on Manus have grown since the governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea agreed in April to close the site by Oct. 31.As the camp was set to close, the migrants — some of whom have waited four years to be resettled — said they were safer at the detention center than they would be in Lorengau, a city close by on the island.“We are begging for our freedom in a safe nation after more than four years of imprisonment, waiting, feeling lost and drifting in this concentration camp,” said Mr. Mohammad, one of several English speakers in the group. “The message we are trying to send to Australia and the world is our lives have been used like products for more than four years now in this inhumane environment.”By law, Australia will not resettle any migrants who approach the country by boat, a policy intended to discourage dangerous ocean crossings and human smuggling. Since 2013, Australia has paid Papua New Guinea to house hundreds of migrants caught at sea trying to reach the continent.The latest attempt to shutter the Manus camp, which sits on a local naval base, has revived the controversy over Australia’s offshore detention policy, drawing condemnation from human rights groups and intensifying a political conflict between Australia and its nearest neighbor, Papua New Guinea.Papua New Guinea has said that resettling the migrants, all of whom are men, is the exclusive responsibility of Australia, and that it would not force the detainees to settle on the island. Officials, however, told the men they had to vacate the camp on Tuesday.The Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection, however, disputed that assessment. Australia has financed three alternative facilities in and around Lorengau and has pledged to provide food and other services to the migrants. How the men are moved to the new facilities is Papua New Guinea’s responsibility, the department said.The closure of the camp and “the management of refugees and those found not to be refugees are matters for P.N.G.,” the department said Tuesday in an emailed statement.Photographs posted online on Tuesday showed the detainees barricading the center with wire, in part to secure themselves from locals, who they claim are looting the camp.The men also took legal action on Tuesday, claiming through their lawyer that being denied water, food and electricity violated their human rights.Many of the men at the camp have actually had their asylum claims approved by the United States but are waiting for placement, according to two American officials with knowledge of the process. They said dozens if not hundreds of refugees from Manus and Nauru, the location of a second offshore facility, will be accepted in the coming weeks and months — adding to the about 50 men who have already moved to the United States under a deal brokered by former President Barack Obama.Mr. Mohammad, who has gone through the vetting process, said it was not clear who would go, or when. And neither American nor Australian officials have provided a timeline.Elaine Pearson, the Australia director at Human Rights Watch, said that even with the expected departures, many migrants would remain in Papua New Guinea for the foreseeable future.“We know there is between 167 and 200 who are failed asylum seekers who definitely will not be going — and there are others, too,” she said.Senator Nick McKim, of the Australian Greens party, who visited the island on Tuesday, called the standoff over the migrants a “humanitarian emergency.” He accused the Australian government of shirking its responsibility.Mr. McKim posted photos from the camp online, showing the men sitting peacefully in the hot tropical sun.They are stuck in legal and physical limbo, said David Manne, executive director of Refugee Legal, a group of Australian lawyers providing free legal assistance to asylum seekers.“The future fate of all of these men remains completely uncertain,” he said. “Australia holds the key to this and any solution.”“It is a highly volatile situation,” he added. “It could get dramatically worse very quickly.”This year, a dispute between refugees and the local authorities over a soccer field at the facility resulted in shots being fired. One asylum seeker was injured.Control of the detention facility will officially revert to the Papua New Guinea military on Wednesday.“It looks as though they will remove us from the center at some point,” said Mr. Mohammad, adding that he had seen around 30 military and police vehicles driving around the area. “We are powerless and hopeless.”
Out of Sixth Grade, and Straight to the Factory She Died In TANGERANG, Indonesia — At the age of 14, Surnah was done with school, and a month ago she took a full-time job packaging fireworks at a new factory near her home. On a good day, she could make about $3.80.On Thursday, she died along with 47 other workers when a welder’s spark ignited a fire at the factory, the police say, causing two explosions.“I am feeling very lost,” said her mother, Suti, 29, who, like many Indonesians, goes by one name. “She was my only child.”Surnah was one of at least three underage workers at the factory, their family members said Sunday. All three were 14-year-old girls who stopped attending school after the sixth grade because their families could not afford the costs.The fireworks factory fire left few of the 103 workers there unscathed. And it has again put a spotlight on Indonesia’s conjoined struggles with workplace safety, widespread child labor and keeping children in school.One of the girls, Evih, has been missing since the day of the fire, said her father, Udin, 35. Some bodies recovered from the factory remain unidentified.A third girl, Fatimah, is hospitalized with burns over 80 percent of her body, according to her aunt, Jani, 52.The factory had no rear exit, and many victims were trapped at the back of the building as they tried to escape. Many victims, like Surnah, were burned beyond recognition.The police are continuing to investigate the fire. The factory owner, the welder and the operations director could face criminal charges, said Fredy Yudha, a police official in Tangerang, where the factory was located.On the morning of the fire, Surnah’s uncle, Uncin, 21, said he heard an explosion and rushed to the factory, where he joined the police and neighbors in trying to break through the back wall.They created a hole large enough for three people to escape, he said. But there was no sign of Surnah.Mr. Uncin said they worked for another half-hour trying to break down the wall and could hear people on the other side calling out.“I heard people screaming, ‘Help, help, help!’” he said.Then there was a second explosion.“After that, there were no voices anymore,” he said.The factory, PT Panca Buana Cahaya Sukses, was in a poor neighborhood of Tangerang, a city of about two million just west of Jakarta, the capital.It was built two months ago in an open field near a junior high school, neighbors said.Surnah and Evih were close friends, their parents said. Evih was inspired to apply for a job at the factory after Surnah started working there, her father said.The police were able to identify Surnah relatively quickly because of the braces on her teeth. After a DNA comparison with her mother confirmed her identity, they delivered a sealed coffin to the family.Her funeral was held Saturday. Among the pallbearers was the Tangerang police chief, Harry Kurniawan, whose department is investigating the fire.While school costs are not exorbitant, many poor families in Indonesia cannot afford to send their children beyond sixth grade.Surnah lived with her grandparents, an aunt and uncle and a cousin in a one-bedroom house. Her mother, who has remarried, lives with her new husband.“Surnah said, ‘It is better if I work than if I stay at home and play,’” her mother said. “Surnah said it is better for her to have income herself.”The factory employed mostly women. Surnah worked in a group of five that had a quota of 1,000 packages a day. If they fell short, their pay would be reduced.Like Surnah, her friend Evih wanted to be independent and to contribute to her family, her father said.“I could see she was so happy working there,” he said. “She could have her own money and her own income. She knew our financial problems and she could also help our family. The last time she got money, she gave it to me and my wife.”
Ancient Skull May Be History’s Earliest Known Tsunami Victim In 1929, an Australian geologist named Paul S. Hossfeld was investigating the northern coast of Papua New Guinea for petroleum. He found bone fragments embedded in a creek bank about seven miles inland and about 170 feet above sea level.At first, Dr. Hossfeld believed that the specimen was from the skull of Homo erectus, an extinct relative of modern humans. Later analysis would show it belonged to a modern human who lived about 6,000 years ago.Now recent research suggests the remains — known as the Aitape skull — could be something more: the earliest known victim of a tsunami.The findings, published Wednesday in the journal PLoS One, may offer useful historical context for how ancient humans living along the Pacific Ocean’s coasts faced fierce natural hazards.“Here we start to see human interaction with some nasty earthquakes and tsunamis,” said James Goff, a retired geologist at the University of New South Wales Sydney and author of the study.Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern half of a large, bountiful island just north of Australia (the western side is part of Indonesia). In 1998, after decades of relative geological quiet, a devastating tsunami rocked the country, killing more than 2,000 people.“This huge volume of water struck the coast and swept away everything,” said John Terrell, an anthropologist at the Field Museum in Chicago who has completed research in the country and is a co-author on the paper. “The villages I knew and loved were sheared off.”Following the tsunami, Dr. Goff and some colleagues went to the country to assess the damage. The visit helped spark his interest in investigating whether there was a link between ancient tsunamis and the Aitape skull.After struggling for almost two decades to get funding for the project, he returned to the island in 2014 to explore the rain forests and crystal clear creek where Dr. Hossfeld had discovered the skull 85 years earlier.Dr. Hossfeld had left detailed notes about where he had found the skull, which helped guide Dr. Goff and his team as they collected samples from the same sediment layer at a nearby river-cut cliff. Back at the lab, they performed geochemical analysis to determine whether the sediment level had been deposited by a tsunami 6,000 years ago.Because they had previously analyzed geochemical signals from sediment on the island following the 1998 tsunami, the team knew which clues to look for, like grain size and composition.They found that the sediment collected from the skull site contained fossilized deep sea diatoms. These microscopic organisms were a telltale sign that ocean water had drowned the area at some point.The researchers also found geochemical signals that matched the signatures they collected in 1998, offering additional evidence that a tsunami had struck around 6,000 years ago. “Bang! Right where the diatoms were looking very sexy and you’re getting excited, you have a signal that says, ‘Hi, I’m seawater,’” said Dr. Goff.He said the findings checked all the boxes for a tragic tsunami tale. “Yes, this was a tsunami. And yes, this is most probably a tsunami victim, and he or she is the oldest one we know.”Sue Dawson, a geographer the University of Dundee in Scotland who studies tsunami sedimentation, said that the team’s diatom evidence was similar to what she found examining sediments in Papua New Guinea after the 1998 tsunami and could be suggestive of a tsunami flooding the area.But she added that the findings do not rule out that the skull could have belonged to someone who died before the tsunami occurred and whose grave was disturbed by the event.Ethan Cochrane, an archaeologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand and an author of the paper, questioned that alternative scenario.“Tsunamis do not rip up the ground enough to remove already buried bodies and put them into suspension and transport them,” he said, pointing to findings from rescue efforts with recent tsunamis. “Overwhelmingly, the dead you find were killed by the tsunami.”The geochemistry analysis supported the authors’ conclusions, another scientist not involved in the study said, although he added that it didn’t contribute much to our understanding of the dangers posed by tsunamis.“It is more of an intriguing geological snapshot of an ancient catastrophic event,” said Iain Stewart, a geologist at the University of Plymouth in England.
In a Volatile Climate on Campus, Professors Teach on Tenterhooks “Twelve Steps to a Compassionate Life,” a guide to spreading kindness, is an odd choice for a political science syllabus. But Shannon Mariotti sees the need. Her seminar about race and class alienation invites contention; course readings swing between Tea Party and far-left perspectives.The 13 students represent the stew of political views at Southwestern University, a liberal arts campus in mostly red Georgetown, Tex. Dr. Mariotti pushes buttons, but prudently. She wants reactions, she said, somewhere “between nice and angry.” She hopes the book — from step one (“Learn about compassion”) to 12 (“Love your enemies”) — will teach students “to develop compassion and empathy” for opposing, even distasteful stances.It is not her only Zen move: As students settle at a long conference table, Dr. Mariotti taps the timer on her iPhone. Classes start with silent meditation. “All you are supposed to be doing right now is to breathe in and breathe out. Every time you think of something,” she said, “just let it go.”Dr. Mariotti designed this upper-level course in response to political divisions at Southwestern, divisions that have fractured friendships. “The only way that kind of polarization in politics will get better is if we can find a way to talk to each other in a way that is sympathetic, but not wishy-washy.”These are fitful times on college campuses. Tumultuous current events — the revocation of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA; the Charlottesville attacks; the Black Lives Matter protests — have brought both relevance and volatility to academic debate. Inside classrooms, professors feel newly exposed. They want strategies to manage testy exchanges and challenges they don’t see coming.At Reed College this semester, instructors abandoned the stage during the first meeting of Humanities 110, a required freshman course on early Greek and Mediterranean civilization. “We cannot have our class if we have students interrupting the teaching,” Prof. Elizabeth Drumm announced as a student grabbed a microphone and talked over her. Others joined onstage. One protester held a sign: “Don’t teach us white supremacy.”At George Mason University, “a fervent Trump supporter” last summer in Jeremy D. Mayer’s course on the presidency sparred at the start of each class. One session, he dismissed an article Dr. Mayer had cited as fake news, with: “The Washington Post hates Trump!” It was “very frustrating,” Dr. Mayer said. “How can you have a class that touches on current events when you don’t have an accepted, fairly standard source of information?”Even content in fact-heavy courses like biology looks less neutral with hot-button issues like reproduction and genetic testing. It’s why Scott McLean, kinesiology professor at Southwestern, is careful when teaching a unit on health insurance. “I really try to present two different sides,” he said. The class movie night showing “McFarland, USA,” about children of migrant workers who excel at cross country, no longer looks like “a free dinner and getaway from the books.” And so a professor who specializes in the mechanics of body movement must now prep for queries about immigration and DACA.Today’s students bring a multiplicity of personal identities to campus — their sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, religion, political leanings — and they want to see that reflected in course content. The values in readings, lectures and even conversations are open to questioning. All good — that’s what college is supposed to be about — except that now the safety screen around the examination of ideas has been pulled away. Higher education is increasingly partisan, and professors must manage these disconnected ideologies, which are sometimes between themselves and their students.With so many professors identifying as liberal or far left (60 percent, according to a U.C.L.A. poll last year), it’s not surprising that the right distrusts the profession. In a Pew Research Center survey released in September, respondents indicated on a thermometer scale how they felt about professors. Democrats rated them a warm 71 degrees, Republicans a chilly 46 degrees.It’s a charged climate and professors know it. The culture wars playing out in the classroom have made them fearful of being targeted. That has been a particular issue at Northern Arizona University, a politically mixed campus in a red state. Six professors there have received death threats or harassing emails or calls, some after being the subject of posts on conservative media sites, amplified by Facebook and Twitter.“The air is different now because what you do in a classroom can end up on Fox News,” said Luis Fernandez. His fall course at Northern Arizona, “Political Crime,” considers Russia’s use of media tools to meddle in U.S. affairs. This semester, he received threats on his office phone, naming his wife and siblings and citing addresses. The day after, Dr. Fernandez found himself scanning the classroom — messages had alluded to a student in class — trying to guess which of the 36 was responsible. “Then I started thinking, ‘This is really silly. My job is not to identify this person; my job is to educate and teach.’ ” The police are investigating.An English professor at Northern Arizona, Anne Scott, did end up on Fox News. After she deducted one point from a first-year student’s paper last spring for using “mankind” instead of “humankind” — she said she had told the class that “inclusive” vocabulary is required — the student contacted the website Campus Reform. She received more than 400 emails, rude voice mail messages and dropped calls. This semester, when the student’s name appeared on the wait-list for a course she was teaching, Dr. Scott said, “I was terrified.”These clashes are affecting curriculum. After meeting with a professor to plan a spring course on fascism and anti-fascism, “we decided it was probably not worth it,” said Lori Poloni-Staudinger, head of the department of politics and international affairs, who has also received threats. The class won’t be offered. “People are more guarded,” she said. “They are watching what they say.”As campuses grow more racially and economically diverse, navigating strong emotions has become a coveted skill. Anita Davis is in a newly created post of director of diversity and inclusion at the Associated Colleges of the South, a consortium of 16 institutions that helps professors with “hot” conversations. “They are struggling to handle tense, confrontational, challenging moments,” she said.Tools she shares are new to professors focused on conveying content. On the first day, she urges instructors to work with students to create ground rules for class discussions, including what to do when talk gets heated. She shares tricks like asking students, before peers pounce, to rephrase or repeat a provocative utterance (often it’s less harsh). If someone suggests that people who ride busses are poor, instead of calling him “classist,” she said, a teacher could reframe: “Let’s talk about the labels that come up when we talk about social class.”It’s also important to openly discuss cultural identity with students, rather than make assumptions. “You can be from the same background and be very different,” she said. “Or you can be from very different backgrounds and think very similarly.” Digging below the surface is critical because students “are asking for more opportunity to be complicated individuals.”Professors who once skipped pre-semester faculty workshops now want to know “how to model productive disagreement,” said Theresa Braunschneider, associate director of the University of Michigan’s Center for Research on Learning and Teaching. “We are responding to increased demand across the university for programming that helps instructors.” A recent workshop had a wait-list of 50; 10 colleges, including an engineering school, have requested custom sessions.The center also has a theater program in which actors perform classroom scenarios; a facilitator debriefs faculty audiences. Popular sketches hit touchy subjects — a Muslim student accidentally leaves behind a backpack; a student jokes that it contains a bomb. What should the professor do?In “Conflict in the Classroom,” a sketch recently staged at Skidmore College, a statistics “class” discusses correlation and causation. The “professor” posits an example: the link between infant mortality and maternal income. The “students” raise questions that have nothing to do with math. “It becomes a debate about the variables,” said Sara Armstrong, the artistic director: One student wonders why the example doesn’t consider household income, and defines a household as man and woman. Another objects. The first accuses the other of attacking. The instructor interjects, “I don’t think this is appropriate for this class. We really can’t talk about this.” The upset student insists, “This is a problem! We have to talk about this!” A student records on his phone.In the post-performance discussion, the faculty members backtrack: What could the instructor have done ahead of time to prevent problems? What could the instructor do in the moment? And afterward? Approaches involve addressing not just what is taught, but how and why. The professor might explain why he chose the case study, pause the discussion, or email the class, acknowledging the disruption and, perhaps, apologizing.Getting faculty prepared is why Kristie A. Ford, director of the Center for Leadership, Teaching and Learning at Skidmore, invited the Michigan troupe as part of a semester series she calls “Teaching in a Time of Turmoil.” “Regardless of discipline, we cannot shut out the world,” she said. “It is seeping into our classrooms, and we need to hone our skills for how to productively engage with it.”•Classmates in Dr. Mariotti’s seminar gathered in a library lecture room overlooking a sunny quad to share with a reporter what bothers them. At the top of the list: professors who expose their views on current affairs.Conner Joyce, a “moderate Republican” majoring in political science, scratched a double major in philosophy because a professor kept comparing Trump to Hitler. Instead of engaging, he said, “you shrink back: I will just write my paper, take my test and move on.”Sydney Cardenas, a Trump voter, objects to liberal students’ special alliances with liberal professors. “They make those jokes,” she said, and instructors slyly signal approval “under the table” or with a giggle. You expect politics in political science, she said, but she was irritated that her education class “was extremely political for no reason whatsoever.”Camille Martin and Mikaela Manion, left-identifying students who have strong religious backgrounds, face prickly moments, too. “People can be hostile when Christianity and the whole evangelical movement are brought up in class,” Ms. Martin said. “It triggers me.”Ms. Manion felt her anger rise in class when a student dismissed religion as “the opiate of the masses.” “It was very derogatory toward Christianity and that was very hard to deal with,” she said. Later, she wrote “liberation theology,” a term that marries religion and social justice, in large pink uppercase letters in her notebook.In the seminar, silent meditation over, Dr. Mariotti dove into the assignment, which was to speak with someone holding an opposing political view. She would use their reactions to help draft ground rules for class discussion. For example, notice your own bias so you can grapple more generously with others.Rachel Arco said she is “a competitive person.” The exercise and the Armstrong reading told her that every conversation “does not need to have a goal or something you can win.” It’s an opening. To which Oscar Barbour offered a useful idea: People should “let go of their personal stake” in a charged conversation.A kind thought, but Ms. Manion wasn’t buying: “I want to challenge Oscar. We are part of the conversation. We can’t distance ourselves from what we care about.”Mr. Joyce jumped in to defend Mr. Barbour: “It can be honoring your own values to open them up to challenge.” But then you risk being “nice” rather than “authentic.”Assuming the best of classmates, Ms. Arco confessed, “is something I’m not very good at.”Agreement may not be the point, or possible. But talking about how to talk proved helpful when a few weeks later the class was faced with “Strangers in Their Own Land,” a book about a Tea Party-leaning community in Louisiana. Some students saw themselves in portrayals they found condescending, or thought the writer was too kind toward those with racist views.In what may prove to be the hidden gift of these provocative times, grappling with dicey subjects may force students to reflect, and not just to react. “They are struggling with how the book makes them feel,” Dr. Mariotti said. “We’ve had a lot of conversations about where the limits of our empathy are.”
Maria Bamford: The First Time Someone Loved Me for Who I Really Am At the age of 43, I had never had a relationship last more than a year. My colleagues in comedy suggested that it was par for the course in our business, and that paired with my psychiatric issues, I might never be eligible for lifelong commitment. But strangely, it was when I was hospitalized in a psych ward that I first found real hope that I could be married one day.Back in 2010, I had been dating a guy for a few months. It was a fast romance, but he broke it off quickly and kindly when he discovered that I was having problems with what I thought was just bad depression.After the breakup, I decided it was the perfect time to try a new medication, a mood stabilizer that my psychiatrist had recommended. Then I signed myself into a facility because I was a little scared of killing myself. “Seventy-two hours on the new med, and I’ll be good as new,” I thought to myself. “Then off to four shows in Chicago!” No matter how bad I felt, work came first.At a hospital in Pasadena, Calif., I was speaking with a fellow jittery patient. He was in his early 50s and said that he had bipolar disorder. I was worried whether I would ever work again, so I asked him what he did. He said he had left a high-stress position in international law and now worked part-time at a used bookstore in the San Bernardino Valley. He had been on disability for several years and needed to enter a mental health facility about once a year for flare-ups of depression or mania.This was horrifying news to me. Disability? I mean, it’s O.K. to take a break, but what if this is actually a full-time chronic illness? Take work away, and I’m a lump. A useless, weighted drag on everyone’s resources.I checked out of the hospital a few days later, hoping to feel better on the new medication. But as I flew to Chicago, I knew something was wrong. I somehow ended up bleeding, hysterical and lost downtown without any identification an hour before showtime. My manager heard me hyperventilating over the phone and canceled all four shows.Thus began a breakdown. Every moment of my life felt unbearable for a year and a half of hospitalizations and outpatient treatment programs. I drooled, I dropped glassware, I passed out face-first into Caesar salads. I could not think, had difficulty speaking and could not — in any way — work.I kept asking other patients the same questions: “Do you still have a job? Do you think you’ll ever be able to work again?” I kept asking my doctors when they thought I’d be well enough to go back to comedy. Of course, none of them could guarantee full recovery. But I did gather some surprising information that I wasn’t particularly interested in at the time: Many patients had partners and wives and husbands.There was the wife and mother of grown children receiving ECT treatments that caused short term memory loss. A young woman who, after a psychotic episode involving the K.G.B. and aliens, spoke of her longtime boyfriend and all the support he provided when she was fired from her sales job. There was the man who came into the ward after a manic, knife-wielding episode in which he might have stabbed someone (I was very out of it and couldn’t get the whole story). He chatted amiably with his wife during visiting hours.Over and over again, I encountered people with debilitating mental illness who were also part of a couple. They weren’t working, they needed care. They were a burden. And yet they were loved.I started to think: That could be me. If I ever got better, maybe I would meet someone who could love me as I am. That maybe, work or no work, I’d no longer have to wait to be “lovable” (translation: “productive”) in order to be loved.And I was right. A year and a half later, when my mood had stabilized (I still had a tremor and memory problems), I met a man named Scott through OkCupid. It was his second internet date; my 97th. It wasn’t particularly magical, just nice. We met for coffee, and he was easy to talk to. I love art, and that’s what he does; he thought I was funny and loves comedy. He really wanted to go out again, despite the fact that he had Googled me and knew about my perceived deal-breaker. On our second date — a hike with my dog in Griffith Park — he was eager to share his own perceived flaws ($52,000 in student loans! Arthritis! An overheating ’92 Saturn! Can’t travel by airplane! )And then, on our fourth date, he said one of the most romantic things I’ve ever heard: “I know they don’t let you have sharp stuff in the psych ward. When my mom was in there, she grew a little beard. If that happens to you, I’ll come in and shave your beard!” His mother, Linda, has passed away, but I think she’d be proud that her son is ready with a Daisy razor. I’ve been stable for the past several years, but I am comforted by that promise of support.Our mutual failure with long-term relationships (Scott had made it to three years) is weirdly what makes us both so committed and connected. As they say in 12-step recovery, it’s weakness, not strength, that binds us to each other. Scott and I have been moody in front of each other many times, most recently when we moved and he saw me scream for the first time. Over a television placement.But we talked about what is now called The Regrettable Incident of the Television Placement with our couples therapist the next day and later laughed about it with friends. And Scott has had his own embarrassing emotional lows, too. It’s no secret who we are and what our flaws are. I think that’s what love is — not having to hide exactly who you are. We got married on April 13, 2015, and have been together for four years, breaking both of our previous records.
Do Americans Need a Prime Minister? THE IMPOSSIBLE PRESIDENCYThe Rise and Fall of America’s Highest OfficeBy Jeremi Suri343 pp. Basic Books. $32.In the fall of 1973, the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. published “The Imperial Presidency,” a book that was widely read because it offered context for the history Americans were living through at the time. With the nation’s excessive intervention in Southeast Asia closing down and Richard Nixon flailing under the weight of a growing political scandal, Schlesinger showed how a menacing increase in presidential power had led to both Vietnam and Watergate, and recommended ways to tame the beast.Jeremi Suri’s succinct and original volume, “The Impossible Presidency,” lacks the fortuitous timing of Schlesinger’s book. Were we living through the first year of a President Jeb Bush or a President Hillary Clinton, readers might wish to turn to it for insights into why our chief executive was not getting more accomplished. Instead, as fate would have it, Suri’s book was released eight months into the administration of Donald J. Trump. And at this moment, the polls suggest that a majority of Americans may be far less worried about ensuring the effectiveness of this president than they are about limiting his power to endanger their country.Nevertheless, any time of crisis involving the presidency is probably a propitious occasion to recall its past. Suri, a professor of history at the University of Texas, here studies a series of chief executives in a sporadically revisionist effort to trace what he considers to be the “rise and fall of America’s highest office.” He rightly notes that George Washington “would inspire confidence from his rigorous and disinterested decision making, and his repeated personal restraint,” and that Andrew Jackson “brought the godly image of leadership down to earth, emphasizing a direct identification with ordinary people and a channeling of their deepest passions.” He recounts how Abraham Lincoln “asserted the right of the president to move people, restrict freedoms, confiscate property, and wage war in defense of the Union.” He praises Franklin Roosevelt for understanding that, by the 1930s, “citizens needed government to help manage the growing complexity of the economy and society” — and, later, to wage war.Suri argues that after reaching its apex with F.D.R., the presidency fell under a shadow that endures to this day because “the continued increase in presidential power exceeded executive capacity.” Especially in this section, Suri’s vigorous writing sometimes lapses into overstatement. He says, for example, that John F. Kennedy suffered from “frequent sadness” and that “the volume of crises was just too much” for Kennedy and his entourage. He insists that during the Cuban missile crisis the president was “terribly overstretched, physically and mentally” and “seemed stymied, distracted and often despondent.” Not all readers will agree with the author’s view that Lyndon Johnson and his administration “echoed Kennedy’s undisciplined New Frontier — hyperactive on many fronts — perhaps with even more energy and determination,” or his belief that for both Kennedy and Johnson, who by most accounts loved being chief executive, “the presidency was a deeply unhappy, disillusioning experience.”And what about Trump? Most of this book was clearly written before the 2016 election, but in at least a few passages Suri addresses the current occupant of the White House, calling him “the president as destroyer.” He describes Trump as the “antithesis” of what the founders had in mind — an “anti-leader” who was elected mainly because he “had never served in public office and had no desire to act like a traditional public servant,” and because he “promised to be a disrupter, a dealmaker and a tough guy taking on what he called a ‘rigged’ system.” Sticking to the main theme of his book, Suri contends that the voters who had to choose a chief executive last November found the job “too big, and ultimately too demanding” — even for men like the “unusually able and precocious” Bill Clinton and Barack Obama — and hence decided that “no one could master the modern presidency,” opting instead for “a brash personality who rejected the entire history of the office, to blow it all up.”After Trump leaves his current job — whenever and however that happens — the presidency will indeed, as Suri affirms, require “a new burst of institutional reform.” To this end, the author makes three suggestions. First, “redesign” the office to allow presidents to forgo “non-necessary roles” and “divisive cultural debates.” Then restore “facts to public discussion,” embracing “more sources of serious research and dissemination,” with “public funding to maintain their rigor and independence.” Finally, and far more controversially, Suri floats the notion of an “institutionalized division of responsibilities between a president and perhaps a prime minister — both of whom would be elected by the American people at different intervals.” He insists that having a single executive in charge of a country so “gargantuan and labyrinthine” has become “anachronistic.”For the moment, any such tinkering, as Suri concedes, is something for the future. Our immediate reality is that we are dealing with a president who has pressed the director of the F.B.I. to drop an investigation and then fired him, has disparaged America’s free press and the independent authority of Congress and the courts, and also, in February, tweeted, “Great job!” after his senior adviser, Stephen Miller, said on television that “the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.”Early in this volume, Suri recalls, although not in connection with Trump, that the founders who met in Philadelphia “feared abuses of power, as they also recognized the need for powerful leaders,” hoping for presidents who were “energetic and heroic” as well as “humble and respectful of citizens.” Perhaps in his next book Suri might devote his talents to the subject of how some presidents in history have tried to abuse their authority, and how we might change our system in an effort to ensure that we Americans do not have to face such dangers again.
John Yoo: Trump Can Pardon Manafort. He Shouldn’t. The indictments on Monday of the former Trump campaign officials Paul Manafort and Rick Gates has some prominent conservatives openly considering desperate measures. The Wall Street Journal editorial board called on the special counsel who handed up the indictments, Robert Mueller, to resign, arguing that he lacks the “critical distance” to carry out the inquiry. So did the New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin.But the most radical suggestion came from two former Republican administration lawyers. To forestall a deepening crisis that could cripple the Trump White House, these lawyers, David B. Rivkin Jr. and Lee A. Casey, urged the president to issue a blanket pardon to anyone involved with Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. This isn’t just a fringe possibility. A reporter raised the idea on Tuesday; Mr. Trump didn’t answer the question.Though such a move would not violate the Constitution, it would provoke a political disaster.President Trump has tweeted that he has the “complete power to pardon.” As someone who supported the broadest reading of executive power as a deputy assistant attorney general during the George W. Bush administration, I think that Mr. Trump has the Constitution about right. Article II declares that the president “shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.” A simple look at this text shows that the framers knew how to make exceptions when they wished. They precluded pardons for impeachments or state crimes. President Trump can clearly issue a pardon, without challenge by Congress or the courts, to anyone — even himself — subject to the Mueller investigation.But unless Mr. Trump wants to meet the same end as his political role model, Richard Nixon, he should resort only to pardons that promote the central purpose of the power. As Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist 74, the Constitution creates a pardon power “out of humanity and good policy” to allow for “mitigation from the rigor of the law.”So far, nothing in the Mueller inquiry cries out for considerations of mercy. Far from it.If the facts of the indictment are to be believed, Mr. Manafort and his associate wove a dark web of shell companies and foreign bank accounts to launder millions of dollars and avoid taxes on unreported income paid by Ukraine, its former president and its pro-Russia political party.Mr. Trump tweeted on Monday that “this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign.” That’s true. But the very absence of a link to Mr. Manafort’s performance as Trump campaign chairman underscores the fact that Mr. Mueller has not brought the charges out of political bias. Mr. Trump ran on a campaign to “drain the swamp” of influence-peddling and self-dealing; Mr. Mueller has exposed Mr. Manafort as a swamp dweller.Anticipating the worries of Mr. Trump’s critics today, opponents of the Constitution’s pardon provision argued that the president might misuse the power to protect his co-conspirators in a treason plot. The anti-Federalists demanded that because “the connivance of the chief magistrate ought not to be entirely excluded” in cases of treason, Congress should have a check on the president’s power to pardon.This critique prompted the framers to articulate a second, more important explanation for vesting the pardoning power in the president: protecting the nation’s security. As Hamilton explained, the benefit of granting this power to the president alone outweighed the costs of possible abuse because pardons could help end civic unrest, even civil war.Only a single man, he argued, could act vigorously in times of crisis — the very reason, Hamilton declared, for the presidency itself. “In seasons of insurrection or rebellion, there are often critical moments, when a well-timed offer of pardon to the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquillity of the commonwealth,” he wrote in The Federalist.Here, again, the circumstances do not pass the framers’ test. No civil war or riots threaten lives and public safety today. The framers had in mind the sort of pardons that Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson granted Confederates during the Civil War and Reconstruction to help bring the rebellion to a swift end. They never could have imagined pardons being issued to venal Washington lobbyists.Even if Mr. Trump has the broad constitutional power to pardon Mr. Manafort and his allies, conservatives should vigorously oppose such pardons on the ground that they would do serious damage to the presidency. In the popular mind, pardons imply the commission of a crime; the innocent do not usually seek pardons. A pardon must be accepted; those who do so imply that they committed the acts.A pardon here would grasp defeat from the jaws of victory, because the charges against Mr. Manafort show no connection at all between Russia and the 2016 campaign. Mr. Manafort’s alleged money laundering and tax evasion, while illegal, do not come close to the level of conspiring with a foreign government to subvert our political process.This is not to say that the White House may not have grievances with Mr. Mueller’s investigation. It appears that Mr. Mueller may have soft-pedaled an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s approval of the 2010 sale of American uranium assets to the Russians. He may have added too many partisan Democrats to his team. Some day soon, Mr. Mueller may even take his inquiry far beyond his initial charge, as set out in his appointment by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, to uncover “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign” by investigating the finances of Mr. Trump and his family.A blanket pardon is the wrong cure for the wrong disease. If Mr. Mueller is acting improperly, the remedy is to fire him, not to preemptively forgive everyone involved in the crime. A blanket pardon would prompt congressional moves toward impeachment, which is the Constitution’s sole mechanism for disciplining, in Hamilton’s words, “the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.”Instead of attacking it at every turn, Mr. Trump should welcome the latest step in the Mueller investigation. Only by cooperating can he credibly prove his innocence.
Is the White House Scared Yet? You know it’s a bad day for the White House when the president’s former campaign chairman is charged with money laundering, tax fraud, making false statements and failing to register as a foreign agent — and that is only the second most damaging story of the morning.Early Monday, Paul Manafort, who led Donald Trump’s campaign during several crucial months in 2016, and a longtime Manafort associate, Rick Gates, who was also a Trump campaign official, surrendered to federal authorities after being named in an indictment obtained by Robert Mueller III, who was appointed as special counsel in May to investigate connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.These are the sorts of people Mr. Trump has regularly chosen to associate with. And given Monday’s developments, they’re not the only ones who should be afraid of being ensnared in Mr. Mueller’s spreading net.Both men pleaded not guilty. The crimes they are charged with are very serious — money laundering alone carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison — but on their own they suggest no immediate link to the original subject of Mr. Mueller’s investigation: possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to help swing the election to Mr. Trump, and any subsequent cover-up of that collusion.Mr. Trump was eager to highlight that point, tweeting on Monday morning, “there is NO COLLUSION!”Surprise! Soon after Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates turned themselves in, newly unsealed court documents revealed that another Trump campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty in early October to lying to the F.B.I. about conversations he had with a professor who had substantial ties to Russian government officials.The professor introduced Mr. Papadopoulos to a woman he claimed was a relative of President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Then in April 2016 he told Mr. Papadopoulos that Moscow had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.” Mr. Papadopoulos tried for several months to arrange a meeting between the Trump campaign and the Russians, including Mr. Putin.But in a late-January interview with F.B.I. investigators, Mr. Papadopoulos said that the professor had contacted him well before he joined the campaign and that the professor was “a nothing” who was “B.S.’ing to be completely honest with you.”Mr. Papadopoulos was not telling the truth, as it turned out. He had joined the Trump campaign as a foreign policy adviser in early March 2016, more than a month before speaking with the professor about the “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton. On July 27 of this year, he was arrested, and began cooperating with Mr. Mueller — a carrot-and-stick strategy that Mr. Mueller is most likely to keep using to try to turn other Trump associates. On Oct. 5 Mr. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal officials.The guilty plea is the most direct evidence connecting the campaign to the Russian efforts to help elect Mr. Trump. After days of dishonesty, the White House acknowledged in July that Mr. Manafort and Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had attended a meeting arranged by Donald Trump Jr. with Kremlin-connected intermediaries who said they had dirt on Mrs. Clinton. And the Trump adviser Roger Stone (recently kicked off Twitter for abusive and profane tweets) has acknowledged having contacts with WikiLeaks, which has been a conduit for Russian-hacked emails.And yet the White House’s response Monday was essentially “George who?” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, called Mr. Papadopoulos a campaign “volunteer” who worked in an “extremely limited” role — a characterization that’s hard to square with the fact that Mr. Trump identified him, along with four other people, as a member of his foreign-policy team in March 2016. And then there were the numerous communications between Mr. Papadopoulos and top campaign officials about meeting with the Russians, including one encouraging Mr. Papadopoulos to “make the trip” to Moscow, “if it is feasible.”But back to Mr. Manafort. Mr. Trump tweeted Monday that the allegations in the indictment concern activities from “years ago,” before Mr. Manafort joined the campaign, and complained once again that the investigation was not focused on “Crooked Hillary and the Dems.” Putting aside Mr. Trump’s bizarre fixation with a political opponent he bested nearly a year ago, he’s wrong about the indictment, which explicitly alleges illegal behavior that continued through 2017.Anyway, whether Mr. Trump was aware of any of the specific details in the indictment is beside the point. He certainly must have known what he was getting in hiring Mr. Manafort. A Republican lobbyist and political consultant, Mr. Manafort has a long history of enriching himself working for some of the world’s most unscrupulous and dictatorial leaders, including Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, Jonas Savimbi in Angola and Mobutu Sese Seko of the Democratic Republic of Congo — not a list most American presidential candidates would want to be on. More recently, he helped to elect the pro-Kremlin Viktor Yanukovych as president of Ukraine. In 2014, Mr. Yanukovych fled the country for Russia in the face of street protests, opening the door for Mr. Putin to destabilize the country.The indictment charges that Mr. Manafort used overseas shell companies to launder more than $18 million of the tens of millions of dollars he raked in through his Ukraine work, and used that untaxed money to buy multimillion-dollar properties, luxury cars and fancy suits. Mr. Gates, a former protégé of Mr. Manafort’s, was charged with laundering more than $3 million. Both men were also accused of lying to bookkeepers, tax accountants and lawyers as part of their scheme.Mr. Manafort, in other words, embodies the sort of amoral, self-dealing denizen of the swamp that Mr. Trump pledged to drain when he got to Washington. What the president did not anticipate was that Mr. Mueller would be the one doing the draining.
The Plot Against America On Monday morning, after America learned that Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and Manafort’s lobbying partner, Rick Gates, had been indicted and turned themselves in to federal authorities, the president tried to distance himself from the unfolding scandal. “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign,” the president wrote in one tweet. A few minutes later, he added, in another, “Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”At almost the exact same time, news broke suggesting that the F.B.I. has evidence of collusion. We learned that one of the Trump campaign’s foreign policy aides, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his attempts to solicit compromising information on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. Despite Trump’s hysterical denials and attempts at diversion, the question is no longer whether there was cooperation between Trump’s campaign and Russia, but how extensive it was.In truth, that’s been clear for a while. If it’s sometimes hard to grasp the Trump campaign’s conspiracy against our democracy, it’s due less to lack of proof than to the impudent improbability of its B-movie plotline. Monday’s indictments offer evidence of things that Washington already knows but pretends to forget. Trump, more gangster than entrepreneur, has long surrounded himself with bottom-feeding scum, and for all his nationalist bluster, his campaign was a vehicle for Russian subversion.We already knew that Manafort offered private briefings about the campaign to Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The indictment accuses him of having been an unregistered foreign agent for another Putin-aligned oligarch, the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Trump wasn’t paying Manafort, who reportedly sold himself to the candidate by offering to work free. But he intended to profit from his connection with the campaign, emailing an associate, “How do we use to get whole?” If there were no other evidence against Trump, we could conclude that he was grotesquely irresponsible in opening his campaign up to corrupt foreign infiltration.But of course there is other evidence against Trump. His campaign was told that Russia wanted to help it, and it welcomed such help. On June 3, remember, the music publicist Rob Goldstone emailed Donald Trump Jr. to broker a Trump Tower meeting at which a Russian source would deliver “very high level and sensitive information” as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr. responded with delight: “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.”The guilty plea by Papadopoulos indicates what information Trump Jr. might have been expecting. An obscure figure in foreign policy circles, Papadopoulos was one of five people who Trump listed as foreign policy advisers during a Washington Post editorial board meeting last year. A court filing, whose truth Papadopoulos affirms, says that in April 2016, he met with a professor who he “understood to have substantial connections to Russian government officials.” The professor told him that Russians had “dirt” on Clinton, including “thousands of emails.” (The Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta had been hacked in March.)In the following months, Papadopoulos and his supervisors emailed back and forth about plans for a campaign trip to Russia. According to the court filing, one campaign official emailed another, “We need someone to communicate that D.T. is not doing these trips.” D.T. clearly stood for Donald Trump. The email continued, “It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.”Thanks to an August Washington Post story, we know that this email was sent by Manafort. Some have interpreted the exchange to mean that Manafort wanted a low-level person to decline the invitation, not to go to Russia. But the court filing also cites a “campaign supervisor” encouraging Papadopoulos and “another foreign policy adviser” to make the trip. Papadopoulos never went to Russia, but the foreign policy adviser Carter Page did.So here’s where we are. Trump put Manafort, an accused money-launderer and unregistered foreign agent, in charge of his campaign. Under Manafort’s watch, the campaign made at least two attempts to get compromising information about Clinton from Russia. Russia, in turn, provided hacked Democratic emails to WikiLeaks.Russia also ran a giant disinformation campaign against Clinton on social media and attempted to hack voting systems in at least 21 states. In response to Russia’s election meddling, Barack Obama’s administration imposed sanctions. Upon taking office, Trump reportedly made secret efforts to lift them. He fired the F.B.I. director James Comey to stop his investigation into “this Russia thing,” as he told Lester Holt. The day after the firing, he met with Russia’s foreign minister and its ambassador to America, and told them: “I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.”We’ve had a year of recriminations over the Clinton campaign’s failings, but Trump clawed out his minority victory only with the aid of a foreign intelligence service. On Monday we finally got indictments, but it’s been obvious for a year that this presidency is a crime.
Trump Won’t Bring Joy to Moolaville Over the weekend Donald Trump raged against the Russia “witch hunt,” which he claimed was an effort to distract from his push for “historic Tax Cuts & Reform.” And there actually is a relationship — but it goes in the other direction. If Trump survives this crisis — which may mean that American democracy doesn’t — tax cuts will have a lot to do with it.For Republicans in Congress know perfectly well that Trump is utterly unfit for office and has been abusing his position for personal gain. Many of them surely suspected, long before Monday’s indictments, that members of his inner circle, and perhaps he himself, have colluded with a hostile foreign power.If they nonetheless circle the wagons around Trump — in particular, if they allow him to fire Robert Mueller, which now seems all too likely — there will be one main reason: Trump offers their big opportunity to cut taxes for the very wealthy. Indeed, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that almost 80 percent of the Trump tax cut would go to people with incomes over $1 million; these people would get an average cut of around $230,000 a year.But here’s what gets me: The wealthy donors for whom the G.O.P. will apparently do anything, up to and including covering up for possible treason, will get no joy from their tax cuts.I don’t mean that history will judge them harshly, although it will. I don’t even mean that plutocrats as well as plebeians will eventually suffer if America becomes a lawless, authoritarian regime. I mean that a few hundred thousand dollars extra will do little if anything to make the already wealthy more satisfied with their lives.You might well ask, who cares? Even if tax cuts would make the rich joyful, this shouldn’t count against the sheer misery Republicans are trying to impose on the tens of millions of people they’re trying to deprive of health care, food stamps, disability benefits and more.Still, for some reason I find it fascinating that all this misery, plus the possible destruction of constitutional government, may happen without even making the intended beneficiaries happy.To be fair, money is a nice thing to have, and I personally am by no means an ascetic. In New York 2017, in particular, life is good if and only if you can afford a decent place to live, which doesn’t come cheap.Furthermore, there’s a lot of evidence, both within and between countries, showing that other things being equal, having more money does make people happier. This evidence is, however, based on surveys that don’t capture what’s happening at the very top of the income scale.To figure out what extra money means at the top, you need to turn to less formal sources of insight.Take, for example, reactions to the Obama tax hike of 2013. Few people seem aware that the wealthy faced a pretty big tax increase that year — average federal taxes on the top 1 percent rose to 34 percent of income from 29 percent of income — thanks to expiration of part of the Bush tax cuts and the imposition of new taxes to help pay for Obamacare.So, do you remember widespread wailing and rending of garments among the economic elite? I don’t; many super-affluent Americans barely seemed to notice.Or take a fascinating Fortune article from 1955, reprinted a few years ago, describing the lives of top executives. At the time, thanks to income taxes and wage compression, such men were much poorer than their counterparts had been in 1930. The 1955 executive owned a motorboat, not a yacht, and “gets along with one or two servants.”Yet the article conveys a sense of men satisfied with their lives. Maybe all the wealth members of that class lost under the New Deal — and have regained many times over in our second Gilded Age — didn’t do much for their happiness?Now, obviously much of the pursuit of wealth is really about status and power — as Tom Wolfe wrote in 1968, it’s about “seeing ’em jump.” You can see this in Trump’s personal taste in furnishings, which a Politico article perceptively described as “dictator chic” — designed not to be comfortable, but to impress and intimidate.But a tax cut that goes to almost all wealthy Americans doesn’t even deliver the kind of status payoff many of the truly rich crave, since the guy in the mansion next door gets the same cut.Again, arguably none of this matters very much. The G.O.P. policy agenda of rewarding the wealthy at the expense of the poor and working class would be vile even if tax cuts would make the rich ecstatic. The party’s willingness to turn a blind eye to corruption with a hint of treason would be horrifying whatever the motivation. Still, there seems to me to be an extra dimension of awfulness to the whole situation once you realize that all this betrayal serves no real purpose, not even a bad one.And maybe, just maybe, members of the G.O.P. donor class will take this moment of national crisis to ask themselves what really matters. For what shall it profit a man, if he gain a $230,000 tax cut, and his formerly democratic nation lose its soul?
When Politics Becomes Your Idol I didn’t get to Richard Linklater’s brilliant 2014 movie, “Boyhood,” until this past weekend. That was the movie, filmed over 12 years with the same actors, about a boy growing up in Texas. But I did have the advantage of seeing it in the Trump era. It’s a sadder movie now. Different themes leap out at you, which were not as prominent in the reviews written three years ago.What you see is good people desperately trying to connect in an America where bonds are attenuated — without stable families, tight communities, stable careers, ethnic roots or an enveloping moral culture. There’s just a whirl of changing stepfathers, changing homes, changing phone distractions, changing pop-culture references, financial stress and chronic drinking, which make it harder to sink down roots into something, or to even have a spiritual narrative that gives meaning to life.You can see why, in the disrupted landscape depicted in the film, people would form the sort of partisan attachments that are common today. Today, partisanship for many people is not about which party has the better policies, as it was, say, in the days of Eisenhower and Kennedy. It’s not even about which party has the better philosophy, as it was in the Reagan era. These days, partisanship is often totalistic. People often use partisan identity to fill the void left when their other attachments wither away — religious, ethnic, communal and familial.Last week my colleague Thomas Edsall quoted a political scientist, Alex Theodoridis, who noted this phenomenon: “Partisanship for many Americans today takes the form of a visceral, even subconscious, attachment to a party group. Our party becomes a part of our self-concept in deep and meaningful ways.”When politics is used as a cure for spiritual and social loneliness, it’s harder to win people over with policy or philosophical arguments. Everything is shaped on a deeper level, through the parables, fables and myths that our most fundamental groups use to define themselves.For years, the meritocratic establishments in both parties told an implicit myth. The heroes of this myth were educated, morally enlightened global citizens who went to competitive colleges, got invited to things like the Clinton Global Initiative, and who have the brainpower to run society and who might just be a little better than other people, by virtue of their achievements.Donald Trump tells the opposite myth — about how those meritocrats are actually clueless idiots and full of drivel, and how virtue, wisdom and toughness is found in the regular people whom those folks look down upon.Trump’s supporters follow him because he gets his facts wrong, but he gets his myths right. He tells the morality tale that works for them.It should be said that people on the left and on the right who try to use politics to find their moral meaning are turning politics into an idol. Idolatry is what happens when people give ultimate allegiance to something that should be serving only an intermediate purpose, whether it is money, technology, alcohol, success or politics.As Andy Crouch points out in his book “Playing God,” idolatry is seductive because in the first phase it seems to work. The first sip of that martini tastes great. At first a new smartphone seems to give you power and control. The status you get from a new burst of success seems really sensational. But then idols fail. What seemed to offer you more control begins to control you.As Crouch puts it: “All idols begin by offering great things for a very small price. All idols then fail, more and more consistently, to deliver on their original promises, while ratcheting up their demands. ... In the end they fail completely, even as they make categorical demands. In the memorable phrase of the psychiatrist Jeffrey Satinover, idols ask for more and more, while giving less and less, until eventually they demand everything and give nothing.”Politics these days makes categorical demands on people. It demands that they remain in a state of febrile excitement caused by this or that scandal or hatred of the moment. But it doesn’t actually transform life or even fill the hole left by the lack of other attachments.If politics is going to get better we need better myths, unifying ones that are built on social equality. But we also need to put politics in its place. The excessive dependence on politics has to be displaced by the expulsive power of more important dependencies, whether family, friendship, neighborhood, community, faith or basic life creed.To be a moderate is to be at war with idolatry. It’s to believe that we become free as we multiply and balance our attachments. It’s to believe that our politics probably can’t be fixed by political means. It needs repair of the deeper communal bonds that politics rest on, and which political conflict cannot heal.
The Russia Scandal: Your Guide This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox.There is still far more that we don’t know about the Russia investigation than we do.Below is a quick summary of the investigation’s major points — and it’s meant to be a small-c conservative summary. I understand why many people are ready to believe the worst about President Trump, but you will be able to follow the story more clearly if you avoid jumping to unproven conclusions.What we know:A Trump campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, had extensive talks with people linked to the Russian government, about “dirt” and “thousands of emails” that Russia had on Hillary Clinton. The Russians told him they were “open for cooperation” with the Trump campaign, as Papadopoulos later told federal investigators.Papadopoulos was more than the lowly volunteer that the White House is now making him out to be. In a March 2016 interview with The Washington Post, when Trump was bragging about the quality of his foreign policy advisers, Papadopoulos was the third person he named — “excellent guy,” Trump said.But Papadopoulos does not appear to have been at the center of the presidential campaign. Rather than making decisions himself, he asked for guidance from more senior Trump campaign officials.Some senior campaign officials were clearly willing to talk with the Russians. The documents released yesterday suggest as much. So does Donald Trump Jr.’s previously reported meeting with a Russian lawyer who had promised dirt on Clinton.For now, these conversations seem to be separate from the charges filed against Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, and Rick Gates. Manafort and Gates were charged with secretly working as agents of a foreign (Russian-backed) government for years, hiding their income from that work and lying about it to federal investigators.It’s certainly possible that Manafort also colluded with Russia during the presidential campaign. It’s also possible that prosecutors are using the other alleged illegal activity as leverage to get Manafort to cooperate in the campaign investigations.What we don’t know:Did Trump campaign officials collude with Russian agents on the release of the emails? There is not yet any public evidence that the conversations between campaign officials and Russian agents led to actual coordination. Maybe Russia’s approaches to the Trump campaign went nowhere — and that Russia then released the emails anyway, for its own purposes. That would be a far less damning series of events for Trump and his aides.Which senior Trump campaign officials were aware of — or participated in — Papadopoulos’s conversations with Russian agents? The Papadopoulos plea agreement includes multiple references to his exchanges with an unnamed campaign supervisor. “Great work,” the supervisor told him, about the conversations. How much more did top officials know, and what did they do?What’s the relationship, if any, between the Papadopoulos conversations and Donald Trump Jr.’s later meeting with a Russian lawyer? The approach to Trump, which came later, didn’t seem to build off of the Papadopoulos talks, based on what we know so far. It seems to have been a fresh, separate approach. Is that because the Papdopoulos talks went nowhere?What did President Trump know, and when did he know it? So far, the investigation has publicly linked Trump to the Papadopoulos conversations only through a single meeting involving multiple people. At it, Papadopoulos told Trump he could set up a meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin. It remains unclear how Trump responded, if at all, and what else he knew about any of the links between his campaign and Russia.What does Robert Mueller, the special counsel, already know that he hasn’t made public? The best guess seems to be: A lot.Yesterday’s filings were full of new information, which suggests that Mueller is releasing information on his own timeline, rather than having it drip out through anonymous leaks — as The Times’s Nick Confessore noted. Daniel Alonso, a former federal prosecutor, tweeted: “Mueller/FBI/IRS are not leaking. Exactly as it should be.”•A campaign of ‘confusion.’ “Trump’s media allies downplay, deflect and deny stories that are trouble for the White House,” CNN’s Brian Stelter explained. “Instead, they tell viewers and readers to hate Hillary Clinton.”“This is a campaign of confusion. It is one of the most important things happening in politics today,” Stelter said. And it was in full swing yesterday, as Trump’s media allies tried to shift attention toward fake Clinton scandals.Fox News hosts talked about uranium (a non-scandal) and cheeseburger emojis (seriously), although Shep Smith was a notable exception, covering the news in a reasonably accurate way.At RedState, a writer argued: “Today’s indictments were a huge disappointment to those hoping for a deus ex Mueller event to remove Donald Trump from the White House.” The charges against Papadopoulos, “a bit player in this whole sorry melodrama,” were “preordained at the very moment he agreed to be interviewed by federal agents because if they want you, they got you.”On the Christian Broadcasting Network, the televangelist Pat Robertson said that Trump “has every right to shut Mueller down … He can grant a blanket pardon for everybody involved in everything and say, ‘All right, I pardon them all. Case closed. It’s all over.’ And I think that is what he needs to do.”In The Times. Michelle Goldberg, Nick Kristof, Harry Litman, David French, Norman Eisen, Noah Bookbinder, Barry Berke and the editorial board all offer their takes on the Mueller news.On a lighter note: The original pinned tweet.
The Dangerous Myth of the Judicial ‘Resistance’ Imagine this: In the days after a new president’s central domestic policy initiative becomes law, a number of state attorneys general and public interest groups — committed ideological opponents of the president — march into the courts seeking its invalidation. By cherry-picking friendly district judges in parts of the country hostile to the president’s politics and values, in judicial circuits with longstanding reputations for legal approaches more sympathetic to one end of the political spectrum, these challengers become remarkably successful in persuading at least some of the courts to embrace legal theories soundly criticized by many in the legal academy — and novel even in the views of some of their proponents. And when these lawsuits finally reach the Supreme Court, the justices deliver a mixed verdict, upholding the core of the president’s initiative, but also sustaining enough of the challengers’ objections that all involved can claim some kind of victory.That scenario is an apt description of the challenges President Trump’s “travel ban” has sustained and continues to face. It is also a fitting characterization of lawsuits filed back in 2010, challenging the substantive centerpiece of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act know as the individual mandate. Yet despite the distinct sense of history repeating itself, conservative and libertarian legal commentators (many of whom were on the challengers’ side opposing Obamacare in the 2010 litigation) are now accusing individual judges — and sometimes entire federal courts — of shirking their institutional roles as neutral magistrates and “joining the resistance” in the various suits against President Trump.From National Review to The Wall Street Journal, these critics are voicing the idea that if President Trump loses any of his legal battles, it will be because progressive judges are out to get him. The fact that many of these rulings have come from Republican appointees or centrist Democrats and that they are often rooted in sound doctrinal principles is left out. To the critics, these judges aren’t real judges; they’re partisan hacks in robes. These critics, in the guise of dispassionate legal analysts, are using the same kinds of language and tactics deployed by the president they claim not to be defending to attack judges and their rulings.For instance, Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law, argued in National Review this month that opposition to the president’s policies had been “advanced” by federal judges “who abandoned their traditional role out of a fear that Donald Trump posed an existential threat to the republic.” And Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute, argued on the Cato at Liberty blog in late May that “what’s going on here isn’t a sober legal analysis” but “a wholesale rejection of Donald Trump.”This is dangerous new ground, to cast judges who rule against a president as biased or unprincipled frauds. Unlike the current legal battle over the travel ban, there was no broad effort by Obama supporters to discredit every single judge who ruled against that administration — as opposed to criticizing the reasoning of their decisions on substantive grounds.To be sure, there are principled disagreements to be had about some of the central and often novel legal questions now arising out of the Trump administration — whether a president’s public statements or tweets should bear on the legality of a formal government policy like the travel ban, whether the Foreign Emoluments Clause applies to the president, whether the president’s Twitter feed is a public forum for First Amendment purposes and so on.But in examining court decisions on these questions, one would search in vain for indications that partisan political opposition, rather than legal analysis, is driving the decision-making. Instead, what appears to be driving the critics’ broad and novel claim against federal judges who rule against President Trump is nothing more than the assertion that these judges have simply gotten it wrong, often by making things up to push their own political agenda. In some instances these judges may be wrong, but that point alone doesn’t suffice to prove the point. There would be no reason to have a federal judiciary with well over 1,000 judges — and multi-member appellate courts — if every case had one inescapably correct outcome; a well-programmed robot could handle that.But discrediting federal jurists as having joined “the resistance” isn’t merely an argument lacking in analysis or evidentiary support; it’s also profoundly dangerous, for it suggests that any and all rulings against President Trump are not just doctrinally incorrect but also illegitimate. Much like criticism of all unflattering media reports as “fake news,” and attacks on the loyalty or patriotism of legislators who don’t vote in support of the president’s agenda, denouncing and dismissing all judges with the temerity to rule against Mr. Trump represents a direct attack on the independence and integrity of the entire judicial branch.Attacks on individual judges based on a single ruling or upon the geographic location of their court or the president who appointed them are broadsides against the entire judicial branch. These attacks undermine public confidence in the impartiality of judges and will make it harder in the future for the courts to stand up to the political branches, even in cases in which their current critics think they should.Of course, the individual judges who are maligned by these critics could fight back — much like most of the other institutions, including entire media outlets, the former F.B.I. director James Comey and Senate Republicans like Bob Corker of Tennessee, who have been subjected to what Orin Kerr of George Washington University Law School has described as the “politics of delegitimization.” But, in an irony upon which their critics may be relying, the judiciary is the only institution in our system that cannot properly defend itself against such attacks, lest it be accused of engaging in the very political activism for which it is being unfairly criticized.The as-yet small but influential number of activist critics seeking to destabilize and undermine an independent judicial branch are well aware that judges called out for fealty to “the resistance” don’t write op-eds and don’t tweet back. But they should stop their attack before their argument goes mainstream. Large-scale assaults on judicial integrity are so pernicious precisely because judicial integrity demands no response. And although we might expect these kinds of broadsides from those who see no value in the rule of law and in checks and balances, dismissing every jurist with whom you have a disagreement as an unhinged partisan represents unhinged partisanship. Lawyers, above all, should understand that.
Mueller’s Investigation Won’t Shake Trump’s Base COLUMBIA, Tenn. — On Monday, nothing changed. If you live, as I do, in the heart of Trump country, you know there is no chance that the indictment of Donald Trump’s ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort, or the guilty plea of a former foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, will alter our political dynamics. Mr. Trump’s supporters will stand by their man. After all, they’ve stood by him through worse, through events and allegations that implicate Mr. Trump himself.It’s an unfortunate truth that the Republican base not only accepts but also often angrily defends conduct from Mr. Trump that they would never, ever accept in a Democratic president. Forget this week’s news for a moment and take a look at the recent past. Would Republicans have stood idly by if Barack Obama fired an F.B.I. director during an investigation of the president’s top aides and then misled Americans about the reason? Would conservatives tolerate a President Hillary Clinton demanding that praying football players keep their religion to themselves, then calling for firings and boycotts if they didn’t comply?The interesting question isn’t whether so many Republicans are demonstrating a striking degree of hypocrisy, but why.No modern Republican president or nominee has been perfect, by any means, but no one can fairly compare their conduct and character to Donald Trump. Since Gerald Ford they have been, to varying degrees, good men. They all upheld and defended American constitutional traditions. They fought hard and tried to win, but there were clear lines of civility and propriety they would not cross.In other words, for 40 years after the fall of Richard Nixon, it was easy to proclaim that character mattered and still pull the lever for a Republican. In 2016, however, a commitment to virtue became costly. In the battle between virtue and politics, virtue lost, and it’s losing still. I’d like to dwell on two reasons. The first is easy to name — negative polarization. The Pew Research Center has outlined the undeniable growth in enmity between left and right. The parties are not only more ideologically extreme, but partisans are now motivated mainly by antipathy toward the other side.This phenomenon explains why reluctant Republicans would pull the lever for Mr. Trump even if he was their “last choice.” They were voting in perceived self-defense, and he fights hard against the people they dislike the most.But this doesn’t entirely explain the curious unwillingness to face bad facts or to critique the most baldfaced lies. Talk to folks in Trump country, and you quickly understand that most of them don’t just want to win, they also want to be good. They want to be proud of their movement. They see themselves as good people, and they want to root for a good man.The desire to think the best of Mr. Trump combined with the deep distaste for Democrats grants extraordinary power to two phrases: “fake news” and “the other side is worse.” “Fake news” erects a shield of disbelief against the worst allegations and allows a person to believe that Mr. Trump is better than he is. For too many Republicans, every single troubling element of the Russia investigation — including multiple administration falsehoods about contacts with Russian officials — represents “fake news.”This week’s news can be waved away. Mr. Manafort’s conduct had nothing to do with the campaign, they argue, even though the investigation continues and even though Mr. Trump showed terrible judgment in bringing him on the team. Mr. Papadopoulos was a nobody, they say, even as his guilty plea outlines multiple contacts with a “campaign supervisor” who seemed to encourage him.And the disbelief isn’t limited to Russia. In a recent poll, a mere 8 percent of Trump voters believe sexual assault and sexual harassment claims against him are credible. This even though he was caught on tape bragging about groping women and in spite of more than a dozen allegations of serious misconduct.But what about when the misconduct is plain for all to see? Then we move to “the other side is worse.” Rage and fear overwhelm, and the desire for goodness recedes. The extreme edge of the #Resistance is the gift that keeps on giving. In some cases, the actions of the president are deemed less significant than the outrages of celebrities and comedians. Sure, Mr. Trump tweeted, but did you see that Kathy Griffin beheading picture?For Christian conservatives in particular, these double standards are understandable (who isn’t tempted to compromise for the sake of victory, especially now?) but not defensible. Is the rage that accompanies negative polarization consistent with commands to love even our enemies and bless those who persecute us? There is so little humility. There is so much anger. And the Republican character corrodes.I’m reminded of an encounter at my church. People know that I opposed both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. They often ask what I think of the president’s performance. My standard response: I like some things, I dislike others, but I really wish he showed better character. I don’t want him to lie. I said this to a sweet older lady not long ago, and she responded — in all sincerity — “You mean Trump lies?” “Yes,” I replied. “All the time.” She didn’t answer with a defense. She didn’t say “fake news.” We’d known each other for years, and she trusted my words.For a moment, she seemed troubled. I wanted to talk more — to say that we can appreciate and applaud the good things he does, but we can’t ignore his flaws, we can’t defend his sins, and we can’t let him define the future of the Republican Party.But just then, her jaw set. I saw a flare of defiance in her eyes. She took a sip of coffee, looked straight at me, and I knew exactly what was coming next:“Well, the Democrats are worse.”
Net Neutrality: Why Artists and Activists Can’t Afford to Lose It Somewhere at a comedy club, a new comedian is about to hit the stage for the first time. She will bring with her the modern tool of the trade: her cellphone, equipped with the notes she has typed, a recording app, and five minutes of material that isn’t worth all that technology. This set is going to bomb. Hard. But she will repeat this process — night in, night out, until over time, that five-minute performance becomes tighter and more polished. Eventually, she’ll ask a friend to use a phone to record a set. And that night she will kill. Utterly destroy the room. That will be the first time she uploads footage of herself performing to the internet. Her life will never be the same.O.K., maybe things won’t change for her overnight, but you get my point. Suddenly her material will be available to the world. Whenever anyone wants to see her set, boom! It’s right there on the internet. Anyone — her friends, bookers, fellow comedians or maybe just millions of strangers — can search for it or stumble upon it. They can hit “play” and the set will immediately begin and run as seamlessly as it did that night at the comedy club. If this happens frequently enough (and it does), then her life and career will change. Then she gets the ultimate break: being invited to do the same set on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.” Instant fame.This kind of thing has happened, countless times. And not just to comics but also to magicians, singers and people who were embarrassed on camera but managed to monetize their shame. It will happen again. But it may not happen much longer if the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, follows through on his plan to roll back the network neutrality rules that ensure that anyone who puts something on the internet has a fair shot at finding a life-changing audience.The current rules, which have been in place since 2015, ensure that internet service providers treat all data — websites, shows, emails — the same. That means nobody has to pay extra money to make sure his or her content loads quickly. This fair internet, where everyone from an amateur comedian to a celebrity to a huge media company plays by the same rules, means you don’t need a lot of money or the backing of someone with power to share your content with the world.To understand how consequential this is, imagine a young woman walking into the HBO offices and saying, “Hi, I’m an awkward black girl and I think I have some pretty hilarious misadventures that you should make into a TV show!” HBO’s only question probably would have been, “How did you get in here?” Now picture this: “Hi, I’m Issa Rae. I have hundreds of thousands of YouTube subscribers and hundreds of millions of YouTube views. And I’m an awkward black girl.” HBO’s question: “When can you start?” I’m exaggerating. But only slightly. Issa Rae started the web series “The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl” on YouTube in 2011. Thanks in large part to its success, six years later, her comedy series, “Insecure,” is set to air for a third season on HBO. It’s hard to imagine this happening in a world without net neutrality.Net neutrality is crucial to the careers of comedians like Ms. Rae and me, but it also allows content about more serious subjects to find an audience, without the endorsement or approval of traditional media gatekeepers.When the activists Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi and Patrisse Cullors started using the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter to discuss the killing of the unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, it began trending worldwide, eventually anchoring the modern movement against police brutality against African-Americans. It’s a reminder that the people providing the sharpest and most current analysis are often not employed by major media. This is still the case: Puerto Rico recovery updates? I’m going with @RosaClemente. Insightful takes on diversity in Hollywood? @ReignOfApril has them all. Weirdly perfect gifs and memes to make it through the daily news about the Trump administration? @ParkerMolloy has got me every time.Thanks to our current net neutrality rules, when people like this take their genius beyond Twitter, to the rest of the internet, they don’t have to worry about whether it’s in a pay-to-play internet “fast lane” that makes access to certain types of content easier. They’re in the same lane as everyone else, because net neutrality means there can be only one lane. ISPs can’t do anything to stand between them and the people they want to speak to, and we all benefit.The exchange of information and ideas that takes place on the internet is more important now than ever. To protect it, we need to keep the current net neutrality rules in places. We need them to ensure that people working to make the world better can reach their intended audiences. We need them to ensure that artists everywhere continue to have a platform through which we can discover their work. Right now, the internet is a level playing field. The question the Trump administration needs to answer is: Why would you want to change that?
I’m 10. And I Want Girls to Raise Their Hands. Last year on a fourth-grade field trip, I noticed that all the boys stood in the front and raised their hands while most of the girls politely stayed in the back and were quiet. It made me upset.On the car ride home I told my mom about what happened. We talked about how it seemed unfair and how boys and girls should be equal. My mom talks to me a lot about women’s rights and how women are treated differently.I told my mom that I thought girls weren’t raising their hands because they were afraid that the answer was going to be wrong and that they would be embarrassed. I also think they were being quiet because the boys already had the teacher’s attention, and they worried they might not be able to get it. My mom and I decided that we should take the experience to my Girl Scout troop.We talked about it as a troop. All 12 girls in our troop said this was a problem they also noticed and we talked about how we could improve it. I suggested that we create a Girl Scout patch that would encourage girls to raise their hands in class and be more confident about using our voices. The other girls loved the idea, and they had other suggestions. As a troop we decided to go the local council, Girl Scouts Nation’s Capital, which represents more than 62,000 girls in the Greater Washington, D.C., region, to present our idea.We decided to call it the Raise Your Hand patch. Its message is that girls should have confidence, step up and become leaders by raising our hands.As with every patch in Girl Scouts, you have to earn this one. To get it, a scout needs to pledge to raise her hand in class and recruit at least three other girls who promise to do the same. As of this week, troops across the country can order the Raise Your Hand patch. I’m proudly wearing mine.People say girls have to be 90 percent confident before we raise our hands, but boys just raise their hands. I tell girls that we should take the risk and try anyway, just like the boys do. If the answer is wrong, it’s not the end of the world. It’s not like answering a trivia question to win a million dollars on live TV.Since our patch launched, Girl Scouts Nation’s Capital has received phone calls from troops all over the country who want to get involved. I’m so excited that girls in other troops that I don’t even know will soon sew the patches onto their vests or sashes.On their first date, when my mom found out that my dad’s middle name was Paul, she instantly knew that if she married my dad and had a baby girl she would call me Alice Paul. Alice Paul was one of the women who led the movement for women to have the right to vote. Having Alice Paul’s name makes me feel special. For women to be equal to men, we have to fight for it.
How to Report When the Science Is Sketchy. (It Often Is.) It was such an idealistic notion — information should be free. No one should have to pay to read an article in a scientific journal. But I should have expected that the law of unintended consequences would kick in.In 2015, many reporters circulated a study purporting that chocolate aids in weight loss, published in an open-access journal. It was a complete hoax; even the authors’ names and affiliations were phony. But it was easily accepted by journals that pretty much accept anything.I didn’t fall for that one, and neither did anyone else at The New York Times. The chocolate study, however, is just one example of totally bogus “research.” As I write in a recent article, the open-access movement has created a parallel universe of so-called predatory journals that come stuffed with such iffy studies.But open access began with the best of intentions. It’s expensive to publish a journal. You need an editorial staff and you need a coterie of trusted experts to review papers and advise on publication. The question is: Who pays for it all?For traditional journals, subscribers do. Or you can pay what can be a hefty fee for a single paper. The problem is that the traditional model shuts out people who cannot afford what can be more than a hundred-dollar-a-year subscription. And if you are a serious scientist, you need more than one. The costs mount quickly. People in poor countries, who may not have access to libraries with subscriptions, were especially disadvantaged.Enter open access. Papers are free — the money comes from the authors, who must pay to be published. There are well-respected open-access journals, with standards as high as traditional ones.What happened, and what few expected, was the birth of open-access journals that will take just about any paper, for a fee. They don’t bother with the pesky expense of reviewers and they publish only online, so their costs are minimal. They send blandishing emails to scientists, inviting them to publish with them. There are now thousands of them, about as many as there are legitimate journals.And because the names of these journals often mimic those of respected ones, some researchers have been tricked into submitting papers. I was first introduced to the phenomenon of predatory journals a few years ago, when a professor of medicine at Stanford told me he had learned of a journal with almost the same name as a prestigious one he edited. His was called Clinical Trials. The other was called Clinical Trials & Patenting. There was, he and others said, a world of difference between the two.Along the way they earned the “predatory” epithet, because they were thought to be taking advantage of innocent scientists. But, I learned, predation is only a small part of the story. Many — probably most — academics who publish in these journals know exactly what they are doing. They are padding their résumés, taking advantage of the fact that colleges may not know if a journal is legitimate or not. When the number of publications a person has can determine his or her chances for advancement, some decide to take the easy route.So what is a journalist to do? We don’t want to be tricked by flimsy science. But it turns out to be a lot easier for us to avoid than you might think.Here’s the little secret of most science journalism. We usually rely on experts who publish in the most prestigious journals for advice on the legitimacy of papers. I keep an extensive and ever growing list of researchers who are knowledgeable, honest, and tuned in to the latest research and its implications. If a paper looks interesting I will call on one or two of them and ask: “Is the work credible? Does it advance the field? Are there caveats I should know about?” And when we are looking for major advances or breaking news, we rely on papers from those prestigious journals.I have changed one of my practices, though. I used to use Google Scholar when I was looking into an area that was new to me. But now that I know that Google Scholar does not vet the journals it lists, I avoid it. Of course, as the chocolate debacle showed, not everyone who writes about science does so exclusively or has a network of experts to consult. And some papers seem so tantalizing that they are, as we say caustically, “too good to check.”So scientists, journalists and university job search committees: Buyer beware.
To Find the Story of the Lost Children of Tuam, I Needed a Guide What is the compact between the living and the dead? Do we owe the dead a small plot of earth? A gravestone or an urn? A whispered prayer, a spray of flowers, or some other means by which we signal to the great silence that we remember?These are among the many questions raised by a continuing scandal in Ireland that is the focus of a New York Times special report called “The Lost Children of Tuam.” Though well-known in that country, the disturbing case, involving the historic mistreatment of unwed Irish mothers and their children, is less familiar beyond Irish shores.The scandal was exposed in 2014 by Catherine Corless, a determined woman with no press or academic credentials. At the matter’s troubled core are the deaths of nearly 800 “illegitimate” children at the since-demolished Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, County Galway, from 1925 to 1961. Institutions like the one in Tuam were created nearly a century ago to rehabilitate “fallen” women and their offspring, with management given to the Catholic Church, whose moralistic teachings dictated much of Irish life.In March, two colleagues — Kassie Bracken, a senior video producer, and Megan Specia, a story editor for the International section — and I became intrigued by a significant development in the protracted scandal. Before long, the story of Tuam was being added to a series by The Times on how death is experienced and processed around the world.I thought I was a natural for this story. I’ve been to Ireland many times and spent a summer there as a Times correspondent. What’s more, my mother was from a County Galway crossroads about 35 miles from Tuam. But it didn’t take long for me to be reminded, yet again, that the chasm of presumption and misunderstanding between Irish America and Ireland is as deep as the Atlantic.Just to understand the history of the stone building that served as the mother and baby home required that I learn more about the development of mid-19th century workhouses, the local impact of the famine known as the Great Hunger, and the Irish war for independence (as well as the civil strife that followed).But as Conall Ó Fátharta, an investigative reporter for The Irish Examiner, repeatedly told me, the case’s implications extended well beyond the eternal whereabouts of hundreds of children who died at the Tuam home. There had been other mother and baby homes around the country, all connected to what many historians say was part of a system that subjugated vulnerable women — a system that also included the notorious institutions known as the Magdalen Laundries.And what of the children they were often forced to abandon? There were many more deaths, shadowy adoptions, medical experiments and painful marginalization. To this day, many adult “home babies” are trying to learn what happened to their mothers.I was paralyzed: The story seemed too complex to be contained in even in an uncommonly long newspaper article. In total, I would interview about three dozen people, but still I needed someone to lead me — and the reader — through this maze of distant and modern Ireland.Of course, she was right in front of me: Ms. Corless, that woman with no credentials, a gardener and grandmother whose determination had unearthed a troubling part of the past and forced a national reckoning.I spent several days with the shy Ms. Corless, who patiently recounted her reporting. Tracking down archival documents and maps. Conducting dozens of interviews. Refusing to accept pat answers from those in power. Ms. Corless told me that she was motivated by the thought of all those children who deserved to be remembered. Ireland, she said, owed them at least that.As I sat in her kitchen one day, sipping tea and eating a slice of apple tart, Ms. Corless answered a number of telephone calls from adult “home babies” now trying to track down relatives. She shared the information she had, promised to do more digging, and was, without fail, patient, even comforting.After 35 years in journalism, all I could do was listen and learn.
Breathing in Ocean Air After ‘Rotting Away’ for Years Much in the last decade of Charlotte Wood’s life has left her feeling trapped.Depression swirled as she underwent heart surgery, lost her home during an extended nursing home stay and turned to junk food for comfort.“I wound up staying in the nursing home 10 miserable, unhappy years,” Ms. Wood, 66, said recently. “I felt I was locked up. And I committed no crime other than getting ill.”Ms. Wood said that long, sedentary convalescence made her feel like a prisoner in her own body. That feeling lingers as she continues to use a wheelchair.In 2004, Ms. Wood was told she had congestive heart failure. Doctors advised her to enter a rehabilitation center to build up her strength before heart surgery.She moved into a center in late 2005 and had the operation a few months later. Because of complications, her recuperation took much longer than anticipated. In financial straits, she lost her apartment in Harlem and became a permanent resident of the rehabilitation center.During those years, she developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and battled incessant depression. Ms. Wood said she had nothing to do besides eat, sleep and languish.“For lack of a better word, I’m obese,” Ms. Wood said. “At the nursing home all those years, me and the vending machine became one.”In 2014, Ms. Wood finally made a change. A social worker helped her secure an apartment in Far Rockaway, Queens, that looks out over the bay. The ocean air, she said, has done wonders for her respiratory illness.The move is like a rebirth, Ms. Wood said, and has inspired a new attitude.“I know I’m heavy,” Ms. Wood said. “I’m working on doing something about it. Notice I never said the word ‘try.’ I’m eliminating that word out of my vocabulary. I’m going to do this this time.”A major drawback of the new home, though, is the distance from her family.“My children are hours away from me by subway and more hours by bus,” Ms. Wood said. “So when I’m in trouble, I’m on my own.”A home health aide is at Ms. Wood’s side 12 hours a day, seven days a week. Ms. Wood is working hard to improve her mood and her autonomy, but mobility remains a challenge. For a long time, she relied on a manual wheelchair to get around, but it was very taxing on her body.In 2016, Ms. Wood bought a motorized wheelchair, which she frequently used to leave her room and venture to the backyard of her apartment complex, overlooking the water.But late last year, the wheelchair’s battery failed. Ms. Wood lost the ability to move freely, and her emotions began to spiral down. Her concerns for her health gave way to mortal fear.“I’m a senior citizen, but I’m not ready to meet the Creator just yet,” she said.Ms. Wood, whose monthly income is made up of $733 in Supplemental Security Income and $194 in food stamps, did not have the money to cover the cost of the repair. Her children were also unable to help.“Everyone’s working, but today when you’re working, you work for no luxuries,” Ms. Wood said. “You just work to meet the needs of your family, your immediate family.”After Ms. Wood overheard another resident of her apartment complex talking about Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, she contacted the agency and was given $566 from the fund to repair the wheelchair.“Since I got the chair, I had an independence that I hadn’t had since I was off my feet,” Ms. Wood said.Over the summer, she regularly made trips to nearby grocery stores and went to the boardwalk, mingling with the many people she encountered.“In all honesty, I feel physically better, mentally better,” Ms. Wood said. “I just want to be here so I can be here for my family and enjoy much more of this life and not sit here and be rotting away.”Her will to thrive has been reinvigorated, aided by a reasonable amount of fear about ever returning to a nursing home.“If anything happens,” she said, “I’m just going to have to put on my boxing gloves and my kneepads and pray to the Creator that I have enough strength to keep on fighting to make it better.”
‘Stranger Things 2’: Pixar’s Andrew Stanton on Directing 2 Episodes In 2016, after Andrew Stanton finished his billion-dollar-grossing movie “Finding Dory,” for which he was a co-writer and co-director, he thought about what he wanted to do next. “I was looking to take a long-term break from animation,” he said in a phone interview from his offices in San Francisco. It takes four years to make a Pixar film, he said, “and those years get shorter as I get older.”Having just turned 50, Mr. Stanton wanted to take another crack at directing live-action features, hoping to come back from what had been a humbling experience helming “John Carter,” box-office disappointment for Disney in 2012. Already a fan of “Stranger Things” and its vividly detailed story of kids fighting extra-dimensional monsters in an early ’80s Indiana small town, he asked his entertainment lawyer to set up a meeting with the show’s producing team of Matt and Ross Duffer and Shawn Levy.Mr. Stanton, who also directed “Finding Nemo” and “Wall-E,” spoke about the experience of being a hired gun on someone else’s project and what he feels he brought to the two episodes he directed: Episode 5, “Dig Dug,” and Episode 6, “The Spy.” Mild spoilers follow in these edited excerpts from the conversation.Of all the shows you could have directed, why “Stranger Things”? I was 15 to 25 in the ’80s. I went to college, studied film, went to the movies like crazy and ate everything up. The Duffers captured exactly what it was like to watch all that stuff. There’s a pure sense of wonder about the show, and an appreciation for unadulterated geek cinema.Did you have any say as to which episodes you were doing? Absolutely not. Shawn Levy, to his credit, really went to bat for me. To executives, it’s like, “Really? The fish guy? The guy that made the big box office bomb?” Fortunately, the Duffers were huge fans of “John Carter” and the Pixar stuff. When they took a risk on me, I was like, “Whatever and whenever, no matter the conditions, just tell me where to show up.”On the continuum between the heavily collaborative Pixar productions and something more director-driven like “John Carter,” where does working on “Stranger Things” fall?I shadowed the production for almost a month in the fall of last year, while the Duffers were shooting their first two episodes and Shawn was prepping his, and the thing that didn’t surprise me at all was that crew was having such fun. It was almost like an internet start-up atmosphere. They were already deep into the second season before they realized the phenomenon they were sitting on. Nobody was jaded. Everybody was just so innocently excited.“Stranger Things” has a distinctive visual style, referencing Steven Spielberg and James Cameron and a lot of other ’80s movies. Is the look of any given scene dictated in the script?You know, the Duffers don’t like to admit what they’re referencing too head-on. I think they try to let inspiration fall where it may. I was basically allowed to run free, to get my Spielberg on and my Cameron on. You try not to be gratuitous. But man, was it fun, staging these shots that were not just straight out of a movie, but that for me were like, “This is exactly what it felt to watch this scene from ‘Aliens.’”What about the cultural references? In one of your episodes, Dacre Montgomery’s bad boy character Billy is listening to Ratt. In the other episode, someone’s watching “Family Feud” on TV. Were any of those touches up to you? “Family Feud” was mine. The songs are a separate thing. But really, the Duffers trust their art department and props department and set-dressing department and costume department to go on little archaeological digs. I haven’t talked about this with the Duffers or with Shawn but I have to believe that half the fun of directing an episode of “Stranger Things” for them is walking onto the set and suddenly seeing the extras wearing those clothes and seeing all the vintage props and getting inspired by what’s in front of you. That surprise is really useful.I remember in one of my episodes, Billy’s working out with weights and smoking, and he has a sleeveless shirt on. The minute I saw it, I thought, “Oh my god, I wore so many of those.” And Dacre said, “I think my character would work without a shirt on.” I told him, “We’ll do a take without it, but just for this rehearsal, can you try it with the shirt?” This is a scene where the shot is of him coming outside the house, so I was all the way across the street with the camera crew. The second he stepped out of the house, I heard about four guys behind I camera go, “Oh man, I totally had that shirt.” I was like, “O.K., we’re keeping it.”You have a sequence where Sean Astin walks through the Byers house and realizes that what Will’s strange drawings are actually a map. Why did you do it mostly as a series of long tracking shots? Not only was it hard to shoot in that house, but also I knew that Shawn had already shot some of the drawing and piecing-together of the maps. I didn’t want my scenes to feel the same. What can I do differently that feels supportive of the narrative, and which captures this slow build of Bob going, “I get it, I get it, I got it?” I wanted to do one well-choreographed take. We ultimately ended up cutting it into three shots, because we got some other coverage. But it was mostly one long master shot, so you could feel Bob’s mood. And we could feed off Sean’s acting, to have like a musical build to the “Aha!”What’s next for you? I’ve got an independent feature that I’m trying to get off the ground called “Revolver.” It’s actually written by Kate Trefry, who wrote Episode 6 of “Stranger Things,” but it was a different route through which I connected with the script. Right now I’m back at Pixar. Part of my job is to be one of the creative overseers of the projects going on here. I spend half my year here, keeping that all going. Hopefully I’ll be doing more TV. I want to be all over the map.
Out of the Woods Last Friday Netflix dropped the second season of “Stranger Things,” its surprise hit from 2016 that’s part horror story, part buddy comedy, but above all, an addictive homage to the early 1980s. And while the show, which revolves around supernatural goings-on in the fictional town of Hawkins, Ind., nods to everything from “E.T.” to synth-pop, the nostalgic takeaway for many viewers of a certain age is the overwhelming sense of freedom that the four tween protagonists enjoy — camping in the woods, riding bikes along empty streets late at night and generally spending a good amount of their time unprogrammed and unparented.I fall smack in the middle of the Generation X demographic, and I can’t count the number of times my friends and I have complained about how unfree and overly controlled our children’s lives seem. Our parents lamented childhood’s fall from 1950s innocence; we worry that our children aren’t getting to experience the warp and weft of life. We rarely let them out of our sight; would we ever think of letting them roam in the woods?Wait. Have we forgotten what actually happened in the woods?My personal Hawkins was the middle-class railroad town of Billings, Mont. One of the places where we high-schoolers hung out was the “15-mile marker,” far enough away from the city line to gather for beer-soaked bonfires. The Friday night bashes were known to include fistfights, contests to see who could run through the flames slowest, sex in the back of cars, sheriff’s department raids and the stupidest trick of all, races home with drivers who had no business being behind the wheel.Was it fun? Absolutely. Do I regret any of it? Not especially. Do I hope my 7-year-old daughter gets to experience her own “15-mile marker” someday? Not on your life.In the same way that our parents replaced the reality of life in the ’50s with their own private “My Three Sons,” Generation X’s curdled nostalgia ignores basic facts about modern childhood. Monitoring the Future’s annual survey of eighth, 10th and 12th graders found that alcohol and cigarette use by minors is at the lowest levels in the study’s history. Drinking and driving is down 54 percent since 1991, part of a huge drop in the number of teenage auto deaths, some 7,000 kids a year since the early-’80s fatalities peak. And while yes, the opioid epidemic is slithering across all types of American neighborhoods, illicit drug use among teens is still down basically across the board, even for marijuana. Which, it’s worth noting, is not the case for their parents. You know, us.For all the mewling about sexting and porn at our children’s fingertips, the teenage birthrate is down 67 percent from 1991, in part because teens are having considerably less sex than they were in the “Stranger Things” era. Combine that with contraception use being above 90 percent, and naturally, the teenage pregnancy rate is at its lowest level in 80 years.And while it’s hard to wrap our heads around the idea that six hours a day of screen time has no pernicious effects — even though we all wasted days on the Atari 2600 and Nintendo — that was the finding in a study published in Psychiatric Quarterly earlier this year. A quarter of the day online is the new normal, with no ties to increased juvenile delinquency. Idle hands aren’t holding iPhones.What keeps “Stranger Things” from being simply a Gen-X nostalgia trip is its plot, which revolves around a child’s abduction — as much a fear in the early 1980s as it is today. And yet, again, progress has been substantial: Child victims are much more likely to make it home safely than they were even 20 years ago. Overall, violent crime victimization for ages 12 to 19 is nowhere near what it was in 1994, its latest peak.Of course, this isn’t to say there aren’t 21st-century problems kids have to contend with, including their overscheduled, high-anxiety lives — but that’s on their parents, not them.Those of us from the latchkey generation both benefited and suffered from all that time on our own. And in our nostalgic embrace of the “simpler times” of “Stranger Things,” we seem to be willfully ignoring so much of what took place where parental eyes didn’t roam.
The iPhone X Arrives Friday. Here’s What You Need to Know. Apple’s iPhone X, the most anticipated iPhone since the original debuted a decade ago, is set to arrive in stores Friday. But unlike past releases, this iPhone may be extra hard to get — and it might not even be right for you.With a starting price of $999, the iPhone X is Apple’s first premium-tier iPhone. Its higher price and cutting-edge features skew the device toward early adopters and technology enthusiasts with disposable income. And because of reports about supply constraints, some analysts predict that many iPhone X orders may not be fulfilled until next year.So should you even bother trying to buy one? Here’s what you need to know about the premium iPhone.Apple opened online orders for the new iPhone last Friday. Just hours after it began taking orders, the website began quoting a shipping time of roughly five to six weeks.In other words, your best bet to get an iPhone X right away is to line up at a retail store on Friday. In a statement, Apple encouraged customers to arrive early — its stores open at 8 a.m. You could also try your luck at a third-party store, like your carrier or Best Buy, though third-party stores tend to carry fewer units.Apple is selling the iPhone X with two options for storage capacity: 64 gigabytes for $999 and 256 gigabytes for $1,149.There are various ways to pay that hefty price.The simplest route is to pay for the device outright. This is the least confusing option because your wireless bill will contain charges only for your phone plan, and you can do whatever you want with the device — like sell it or switch to a different wireless carrier — whenever you want.You can also opt to spread out the payments with a monthly installment plan. For example, if you are a Verizon customer, you can choose to pay off the $999 iPhone over 24 months for $41.62 a month. This is a nice option because spreading out the payments does not incur interest fees.Another option is to go for an early upgrade plan, which lets you pay a flat monthly rate and upgrade to a new iPhone annually. It’s essentially leasing a new phone every year.There are various early upgrade plans on the market. With Apple’s early upgrade program, you can pay $49.91 a month, and once you’ve made 12 payments, you can trade in your iPhone to upgrade to the next one and continue paying that monthly rate. (I’m not a fan of this path because I suggest cherishing your devices for as long as you can before upgrading.)Before you splurge, consider your options. Apple’s iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which share many features of the iPhone X, have starting prices of $699 and $799. The cheaper iPhones have the same computing processor as the iPhone X, so they are just as fast, and their 12-megapixel rear cameras are on a par with the rear camera on the iPhone X.So what’s the difference? Mainly, the screen.■The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch screen that takes up the entire face of the device, with the exception of a notch at the top containing an infrared camera system.■The iPhone 8 has a 4.7-inch screen, and the iPhone 8 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen.Both of the cheaper iPhones have bezels — the border surrounding the display — whereas the iPhone X has eliminated the bezel.Other than screen size, the screen technologies differ. The iPhone X is the only Apple phone that uses OLED, a type of display that can be made thinner, lighter and brighter, and with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD. So the screen on the iPhone X looks more vibrant than the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 8, which still use LCD.Last but not least, the iPhone X has a unique infrared face scanner. The technology, called Face ID, uses the infrared camera system on the front of the phone to scan the contours and shape of a person’s head to unlock the device and authorize mobile payments. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus have normal front-facing cameras for snapping selfies.The primary way you can unlock an iPhone X is with the face scanner. The premium phone lacks Touch ID, the fingerprint sensor that has been a popular feature on iPhones for several years.Face ID is brand new — there hasn’t been anything like it on a smartphone before. It works by spraying an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots. The imaging system can stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it. Because the shape of a person’s head is unique, the likelihood of bypassing facial recognition with someone else’s face is one in a million, according to Apple.Older facial recognition systems worked by using the camera to take a photo of yourself and comparing that with an image that was stored on the device. All a thief would need to do to fool the system was hold a photo of your face in front of the camera — which some people already did with Samsung’s facial-recognition feature. The false acceptance rate of older face recognition systems was one in 100.It will be interesting to see how early adopters react to Face ID, and whether it will work well with many different kinds of faces. If you’re skeptical or turned off by the idea of your phone constantly scanning your face to unlock your phone, you could always get an iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus, which still have Touch ID.
Managing the Storm of a Toddler’s Tantrum Pity the poor parent whose child is throwing a public tantrum. No, don’t come up with a list of excellent parenting strategies that you’re quite sure would have averted this unhappy scene. And don’t use it as an opportunity to deliver a little homily about kids today or parents today and how much better things used to be. Just pity the poor parent, offer to help if you think you can, and otherwise, give everyone some space.We tend to focus on tantrums as bad behavior, without considering their emotional content. But responding with adult anger to what we see as misbehavior only makes things worse, and misses the question of what is going on inside the child.“What are tantrums made of?” asked Michael Potegal, a neuroscientist and associate professor at the University of Minnesota. “The answer is anger, and what I call distress — a term I use for ‘sadness plus.’” In studies of typically developing children, anger is most likely shown at the beginning of a tantrum, and then declines, while distress behaviors tend to be pretty constant throughout. “That tantrums end with crying and not with anger is significant because kids’ crying tends to elicit parent comfort-giving,” he said. “The fact that tantrums naturally end on a distress note is probably an adaptation to reconciliation.”Seventy-five percent of 2-year-olds will have had at least one temper tantrum in the past three months, said Dr. Helen Egger, a psychiatrist specializing in early childhood who has done research seeking to distinguish typical childhood tantrums from those that may be a sign that something is wrong.Tantrums remain very common in 3-year-olds, and then they become less frequent over the next couple of years, said Dr. Egger, the chairwoman of the department of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Langone Health. Developmentally, they come right when fear and aggression peak, but the child is still working on language skills.So what should parents do, faced with a tantrum?“I don’t think any child having a tantrum can respond to what I hear all the time: ‘Use your words,’” Dr. Egger said.Instead, the parent should try to be a “container,” she said, to keep the child safe, and then talk about it afterward. “You have to see it like a storm,” she said. “Manage the storm, then find out what was happening beforehand.”“Things are unglued,” Dr. Egger said. “What do children need to become reglued? They need that feeling that there’s a competent grown-up who is there to contain them.” The last thing you want, she said, is for a child to have the feeling of pushing against a wall, only to see that wall fall down.Dr. Potegal suggested that parents think about what function a tantrum is serving for a child: Is it attention getting, with negative attention better than no attention? Is there something tangible at stake, like food or a toy? Or is there something the child wants to escape doing?Tantrums typically happen when children are hungry or tired or when there has been some significant change in their routine, Dr. Egger said. The children with more problematic tantrums, she said, are the ones who are triggered by anger and frustration, or by transitions — they aren’t particularly tired, they’re just furious that it’s bedtime or bath time.And sometimes there’s no clear trigger, which can be a sign that all is not well. “Parents describe the tantrums just coming out of the blue,” Dr. Egger said, “‘Do you want to wear your blue shoes or your red shoes?’ and you’re done.”It’s less common and more concerning for children to have tantrums regularly with babysitters or teachers, and in fact, Dr. Egger said, “kids who have tantrums outside of the home at school and day care, at church, outside, that’s another flag.”Children with increased frequency of tantrums — almost every day, or even more often — and who bite, kick, hit or break things during the tantrums are the children to worry about, Dr. Egger said. Such children are eight times more likely to meet criteria for “impairing mental health disorders,” such as anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depression, and also more likely to develop problems later on. “And when we follow these children into early and middle childhood, these aggressive early childhood tantrums may be associated with emotional disorders like anxiety and depression,” she said.“Most children who have tantrums that are really severe in duration and intensity aren’t just normally angry, they have something else wrong with them,” said Dr. Gabrielle Carlson, professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Stony Brook University School of Medicine. “They may have A.D.H.D. or depression or another psychiatric disorder.” For a long time, she said, tantrums were understood as aggression, but more recently, psychiatrists have begun to think of these children with “a very short fuse and a very large explosion” as being highly irritable, rather than aggressive.A child’s irritability may be a clue to some medical problem causing pain or distress; it’s a rare explanation for tantrums, but there are certainly children whose tantrums decrease or stop when they get treated for reflux, or some other cause of underlying discomfort, or for something that is impairing their ability to communicate and leaving them frustrated. And children with developmental disabilities and autism also often have tantrums, so it’s important to assess the child’s general development.“My son, who has grown up to be quite a nice lad, used to have really, really bad temper tantrums,” Dr. Carlson said. “He would scream and yell and throw his shoes. It would last about 45 minutes.” She would put him in his room, “and then he would come out, he would tell me he was mad and sad.” She worried about it, she said, and she thought it was abnormal. “He turned out to have A.D.H.D., it wasn’t just a normal kid being a little bit delayed outgrowing the terrible 2s,” she said. “He had a developmental condition, and the oppositionality and poor anger management were among the signs.”So if tantrums are frequent or aggressive (hitting, kicking, biting, breaking things), parents should by all means get help, rather than blaming themselves. If you find yourself changing family routines or avoiding triggers out of terror that you’ll provoke a tantrum, that’s another sign that you should seek help. And finally, if an experienced day care provider or preschool teacher says these tantrums are something out of the ordinary, take that seriously, though a healthy typical child can certainly have an occasional nuclear meltdown, and many of us have terrible memories of one public agony or another.But if it’s happening regularly, talk to your pediatrician, think about possible medical problems, and get a referral to someone experienced in early childhood who can evaluate the child for mental health issues — a child psychiatrist or psychologist or developmental specialist. To say that extreme tantrums may be a sign of something else is only to say that that child — and those parents — may need some extra help, and the sooner the better.
At 100, Thelonious Monk Gets a Hero’s Celebration DURHAM, N.C. — In some sense, Thelonious Monk’s songs present the jazz musician’s perfect challenge. They’re opaque, lumbering and miraculously catchy. Played right, each passing harmony feels rich enough to last an entire song. But if you can’t make these pieces move — get them feeling spry, almost balletic — you’ve lost the battle.On the final two nights of a 10-day festival here celebrating Monk’s 100th birthday, two of today’s great tenor saxophonists put their hands on his music. From very different angles, they showed what makes him jazz’s most popular composer to cover, and one of its most difficult.The context was the same for Joshua Redman on Wednesday as it was for Ravi Coltrane on Thursday: They were backed by a standard jazz trio led by the pianist Ethan Iverson as they played tight renditions of classic Monk repertoire. But while Mr. Redman soloed with a smokestack effusiveness, getting underneath the melodies and setting them alight, Mr. Coltrane’s horn was liquid. It seemed to move freely on its own, as if any expansion or turn was coming directly from the notes themselves.The festival, Monk@100, was produced by Duke University, and studiously programmed by Mr. Iverson and Aaron Greenwald, the director of Duke Performances. It was the highest-profile and probably the most far-reaching of the many Monk tributes happening this year, and it attested to the durability of Monk’s influence, even at a time when consensus in jazz has grown rare.The major focus, perhaps inevitably, was on Monk’s pen. The 60-plus tunes he is known to have written are some of the most beloved pieces in jazz’s canon, partly because they live just barely outside of its conventional language. That’s what the daytime show on Oct. 21 was about, when five pianists took turns playing solo and duo renditions of almost every work Monk wrote. The same applied for the performances of the J.D. Allen Trio, which worked with a different guest each of the festival’s first three nights.But it went beyond that. On Oct. 20, the pianist Jason Moran came together in a duo with the drummer and multi-instrumentalist Tyshawn Sorey. (I wasn’t in town for this part of the festival but was able to watch video shot by a film crew documenting the entire event. That footage may someday be public.) Their first set began with a loose reading of the ruminative melody to “Monk’s Mood” and ventured quickly into abstraction, dispatching with the standard ideas of what it takes to interpret Monk’s music.This set was one of the moments when the spirit of Monk’s piano playing got called up and shocked back to life in the air of the present day. This came naturally through Mr. Moran’s fingers and his memory. He grew up idolizing Monk and reworked Monk’s language of halting gestures and piquant dissonance, eventually rendering his own approach. Playing with Mr. Sorey here, he often reduced Monk’s song themes to scaffolds and wisps; his own chiming, splintery swing feels attested to Monk’s long shadow, even in a context dominated by free improvisation.“I didn’t learn what the normal way is to do things: Monk is my normal way to do things,” Mr. Moran said after the festival, describing his formative years. “When that’s the bar that you pull against, you already know certain things about how the body works with the piano, how important dance is to a song, how great swing feels at a medium tempo if you’re doing it right.”Starting in the early 1940s, Monk became a major architect of the style known as bebop — and, immediately, an iconoclast within it. He helped devise its language of thick harmonies, zipping melodies and steamed-up rhythm. But Monk maintained a rough piano style and wrote tunes to reflect it; his virtuosity worked on a level that was more tonal, and more physical. (In Monk’s musical manuscripts, which Mr. Iverson discovered on eBay and posted to his personal blog, he even invents a more evocative way of spelling a bell sound: “Tding tding tding.”)Rather than dashing futurism, his bebop was about arrangement and choreography. Each note in his compositions sounds like a weight-bearing limb, supporting the body of the song and leading into the next movement. And those limbs often pause to hold a pose: On a simple, singsong piece like “Rhythm-a-Ning” or a wound-up work like “Criss Cross,” he uses silence more than speed.“There are few artists that everyone would have such a uniform agreement on: ‘Yes, let’s check out this repertoire,’” Mr. Iverson said in an interview Thursday. “Everyone that has come down to do this festival has been like, ‘Oh yeah, I’d like to study some Monk.’ Everybody is excited and sometimes a little daunted by trying to play the songs right, trying to have a personal opinion.”A hundred years after Monk’s birth, on Oct. 10, 1917, in Rocky Mount, N.C., roughly 60 miles east of Durham, we’re deep into something like the post-history of jazz — at least as a definable style and a set of universal touchstones. New ensembles rarely spend much time on standard repertoire, and most mainline jazz is growing from the conservatory and the composer’s mind, not the fertile space of jam sessions. (Monk first developed a following as the house pianist at Minton’s, the Harlem club whose jam sessions in the ’40s incubated bebop.) To be an improvising musician nowadays almost always means writing your own textbook, often with source material from outside the blues and jazz tradition.Still, learning to play Monk’s music remains an almost unavoidable rite of passage. He is one of many jazz luminaries whose 100th birthdays fall this year, including Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald and Buddy Rich, but his has seemed to matter the most. Festivals well beyond Durham programmed tribute content this year. The Jazz Standard in Manhattan devoted three weeks to consecutive Monk-related shows, from vastly disparate artists. Even Jazz at Lincoln Center, whose most intimate stage, Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, is named for Gillespie, devoted more programming this month to Monk. (Gillespie’s birthday was on Oct. 21.) A host of albums have come out reinterrogating Monk’s compositions.At Durham Fruit and Produce Company, an old warehouse that has recently been retrofitted as a small performing arts venue, sculptural work by the North Carolina-based artist André Leon Gray was installed throughout the building: near the entrance, an altar with accouterments to Monk; down the hall, an image of the pianist’s silhouette inscribed with his catchphrase, “Always know;” onstage, a tar painting of Monk’s face, surrounded by black and white keys arranged in a loose asymmetry.And in the lobby, just beside the makeshift bar, there was a listening station with some turntables set up. Vinyl copies of Monk’s full discography were available for attendees to spin. The afternoon before the festival’s final show, when Mr. Coltrane performed with Mr. Iverson’s trio, I sat down and cued up “Monk’s Music,” the classic septet recording from 1957. (A young John Coltrane, Ravi’s father, appears on the album.)The festival’s live proceedings seemed to defend jazz’s old idea that the onstage ritual can encompass both veneration and invention. And then there was the listening station: a reminder that the old texts remain. In a time of postmodern splay, Monk is here to stay.
Why Unesco Needs the United States On Oct. 12, the United States announced it will withdraw from Unesco, the cultural and educational arm of the United Nations, because of what it calls the organization’s anti-Israel bias.Unesco’s largely symbolic presence in the Palestinian territories — including the designation of the Old City of Hebron as a World Heritage site — makes up a tiny part of a global mandate covering 195 member states and 10 associate members and will not be affected by the absence of the United States.With its misguided decision, the United States is forfeiting its leadership in a cause on which Unesco and its partners in the United States, Europe and beyond are finally making progress: protecting art, sacred buildings and other historic treasures from deliberate attacks during armed conflict.From the smashing of mud-brick shrines in Timbuktu to the burning of Rohingya villages in Myanmar, assaults on cultural heritage have become a depressingly common feature of contemporary conflict. Even amid its rapid retreat in Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State has continued its destruction. In June, with international forces closing in on Mosul, the group blew up the 12th-century Great Mosque of al-Nuri and its extraordinary minaret, whose leaning, “humpback” silhouette has for centuries defined the city’s skyline.For years, Unesco’s outgoing director general, Irina Bokova, has sounded the alarm, noting that the attacks are part of campaigns to wipe out entire communities. Ms. Bokova wrote in 2012 that “we must start seeing cultural heritage as an international security issue.”In early 2015, the Islamic State showed how real a threat this was in its on-camera rampage through the Mosul Museum and defacement of the colossal Winged Bull of Nineveh. Yet the world stood by months later, when the group occupied the ancient site of Palmyra, blew up its extraordinary temples and decapitated Khaled al-Asaad, the 84-year-old Syrian archaeologist who devoted his career to the site.Unesco bore some of the blame. By loudly condemning such attacks, the organization gave publicity to would-be destroyers even as it lacked authority to stop them. And because it worked on behalf of sovereign member states, Unesco was unable to reach rebel-held areas where its resources were most needed.In the final years of the Obama administration, United States officials began to embrace Unesco’s call to action. In 2014, John Kerry, then the secretary of state, warned that the Islamic State’s campaign against culture was “purposeful” and directly connected to attacks on populations.Meanwhile, the government-administered Smithsonian Institution, working with groups in the United States and the Middle East, began giving emergency training and technical support to Iraqi and Syrian preservationists. This has been crucial to the successful protection of sites and museums in northern Syria, among other places.And in May 2016, President Barack Obama enacted bipartisan legislation to protect international heritage “at risk due to political instability, armed conflict, or natural or other disasters” — establishing for the first time a body within the executive branch to address the threat.The American efforts coincided with bold new thinking in the international community. In 2016, recognizing that cultural destruction was directly related to ethnic cleansing, the International Committee of the Red Cross entered an agreement with Unesco, in which it pledged to help evacuate cultural objects “at imminent risk.” While the accord has not yet been tested in practice, it is significant because the I.C.R.C. is often on the ground on both sides of a conflict and has unparalleled access to sites.With Unesco’s support, France and the United Arab Emirates established a $75 million fund to provide “safe havens” and other forms of protection for objects and monuments under threat of attack. The American investor and philanthropist Thomas Kaplan, who has given $1 million, is chairman of the fund.Finally, in March, pushed by Unesco and the governments of France and Italy, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution explicitly linking attacks on cultural heritage to terrorism and calling on member states to provide one another with “all necessary assistance” to prevent those attacks.Over the past year, an independent, United States-based task force — sponsored by the J. Paul Getty Trust with support from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences — has been exploring ways to give teeth to these commitments. In a report to be released by the Getty Trust in December, the group draws on the Responsibility to Protect, or R2P, doctrine, adopted by the United Nations in 2005, which provides a basis for intervention to prevent humanitarian atrocities.The movement to integrate cultural heritage into security policy has quickly gained support from several European governments and leading international institutions. In a landmark August 2016 decision against an extremist in Timbuktu, the International Criminal Court ruled the destruction of cultural heritage a war crime.The European Union has formally incorporated the protection of cultural heritage in the mandates of 15 E.U. military and civilian missions around the world. And for the first time, the United Nations is including the protection of sites and monuments in an official mandate for armed peacekeepers in Mali.During the opening of the United Nations General Assembly in September, the Global Center for the Responsibility to Protect convened a group of top Western officials to discuss the new strategies. It was attended by the European Union minister of foreign affairs, Ms. Bokova and her newly appointed successor at Unesco, the former French culture minister Audrey Azoulay.With its boycott of Unesco, the United States was absent. “I’m pretty sure the U.S. government hates ISIS. It doesn’t want to see the destruction of antiquities in Mosul or Timbuktu,” Simon Adams, the director of the Global Center, said. “But at a key moment when Unesco is reshaping this debate, the U.S. opts out.”The international community has a woeful record of protecting art and monuments in conflict zones. To truly make a difference, the recent breakthroughs will require robust cooperation among Unesco, the Security Council, regional governments, international peacekeepers, NGOs and above all local activists on the ground.But if the United States, whose military has greater reach than that of any other country, turns its back on these efforts, the chances of success will be slim. And we may find ourselves watching another Palmyra reduced to rubble.
Tell Us 5 Things About Your Book: ‘Hitler in Los Angeles’ Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels “saw Hollywood as central to their efforts to win over the American public and the world to their cause,” Steven J. Ross writes in his new book, “Hitler in Los Angeles.” Nazis and other fascists in L.A. planned terrorist attacks against Jews and also plotted to kill high-profile Hollywood figures including, according to Mr. Ross’s account, Al Jolson, Charlie Chaplin and Samuel Goldwyn. Leon Lewis, one of the founding members of the Anti-Defamation League and a veteran of World War I, recruited fellow military veterans and others to create a spy ring to foil the Nazis’ plans and counter their influence. Below, Mr. Ross, a professor of history at the University of Southern California, discusses the initial discoveries that led him to dive into the subject, the surprising things he learned about a German previously known as an arch-villain and more.When did you first get the idea to write this book?The roots of the book go back to the fall of 1999. I was researching the anti-Nazi activities of Edward G. Robinson for a chapter in “Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics.” U.S.C. has his archives. I got particularly interested in the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League.At the same time, I came across an online exhibit mounted by California State University, Northridge, which documented the activities of Nazis and fascists in Los Angeles. I pulled out a number of documents, but it was going to be impossible to read through 200-plus boxes in the collection for what was going to be a page in the book. So in 2010 or 2011, I went back to Northridge and learned the story of these men and women who risked their lives to undermine this fascist operation.The other thing that helped me was that Leon Lewis was the spymaster, and his associate spymaster, Joseph Roos, left his papers to U.S.C. I discovered after looking through the boxes that Roos had a memoir he was writing. It laid out everything that was happening, and after reading 30 pages of his memoir, everything became clear, and I knew there was an incredible story. It’s what every historian dreams about: an important story no one has ever told before.What’s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?That’s an easy one. The German consul Georg Gyssling, who was sent to L.A. by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels in June 1933, with the single task of stopping Hollywood from making any anti-Nazi films, has been the arch-villain of decades of Hollywood histories. I discovered he was secretly working to bring down the Hitler regime, by passing on information about the faltering German economy and German war plans to his Jewish friend Julius Klein; Klein was an officer in the Illinois National Guard, and he in turn passed it on to George C. Marshall, the head of Army intelligence. I wound up interviewing Gyssling’s daughter, who was American-born. One of the things she told me was that he had managed, because he was under suspicion back in Germany for not being sufficiently Nazi, to get transferred to Italy and become part of Operation Sunrise. That meant he was working with Allen Dulles and helped to negotiate the surrender of all German forces. So the villain was no villain at all. Even though he helped negotiate the surrender in early May, he was arrested and taken into custody, and then was sent to Nuremberg for interrogation. He was only released after Klein wrote a character reference saying Gyssling was no Nazi, but that he had despised his superiors and had been passing valuable information to the American government since arriving in the United States.In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?I’ve always wanted to write for a broad audience, but I initially approached the subject matter as an academic historian, focusing on where it fit into the sweep of American history in the 1930s and ’40s. But this story was so vivid that I did something new: I ventured into narrative nonfiction far more than I’ve ever done in the past. It was going to be a character-driven book. I wanted to write a history that surprised me, from the perspective of Lewis and his spies as they saw what was unfolding in real time. We know what ultimately happened, but Leon Lewis didn’t know if Nazis and fascists would carry out their repeated threats to kill Jews, or that a Holocaust would take place, but they had to be prepared.Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?At a certain point, I realized I could make my story engaging by thinking about it in cinematic terms. If this were a movie, how would the scenes roll out? The person who most influenced me was Warren Beatty, who I interviewed for “Hollywood Left and Right.” I’m thinking of “Reds.” He was one of the first people to use witness testimonies and integrate them into his more fictionalized account of John Reed and Louise Bryant. He was trying to make history come alive, and he used live people as well as these actors.Persuade someone to read “Hitler in Los Angeles” in 50 words or less.It offers important lessons for today. Leon Lewis and his spies defeated a variety of enemies bent on violence and murder. They showed us that when a government fails to combat extremists, democracy demands that every citizen protect the lives of every American, no matter their race or religion.This interview has been condensed and edited.
When the Wise Men Failed On Nov. 2, 1967, a dozen or so of America’s most respected foreign policy mandarins assembled at the White House to meet with President Johnson and his top Vietnam advisers. While the president maintained a sternly optimistic public face on the war, the conflict was threatening to consume his Presidency, and so he sought the wisdom of these advisers, a virtual Mount Rushmore of America’s postwar foreign policy establishment.October had been a most unkind month to the president. Polls revealed that public support for the war, and for Johnson, was eroding, and the punishing bombing campaign against North Vietnam was an increasing point of dissent. The demands of his military commanders for more troops seemed insatiable. Johnson had recently, and reluctantly, authorized one final increase, to 525,000 by the end of 1967 (there had been 23,000 American military personnel in Vietnam in December 1964). And the president knew that any additional increment in manpower would require mobilizing the reserves, further exposing the mounting costs of the war.Behind closed doors, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara was despairing of the war effort. In May he told Johnson plainly the war “is not going well,” and as for the bombing, his international political instincts were sharp: “The picture of the world’s greatest superpower killing or seriously injuring 1,000 noncombatants a week while trying to pound a tiny backward nation into submission on an issue whose merits are hotly disputed is not a pretty one.”And the antiwar movement, once dismissed as a sideshow, was gathering mainstream credibility, and numbers. On Oct. 21, tens of thousands gathered outside the Pentagon in protest, resulting in hundreds of arrests. And it was not just radicals who were turning against the war. Senator Robert Kennedy was now raising his own doubts in public, and one October poll showed him trouncing Johnson in a head-to-head primary race, 52 percent to 32 percent.The president needed reassurance. He had called upon the “Wise Men” previously, in the summer of 1965, when final plans were nearing completion to go all-in with ground troops. They urged him then to take decisive action. Faced with another crossroads, Johnson called on the Wise Men once again.These Wise Men, or Wise Old Men, as some White House staff members took to calling them, included former Secretary of State Dean Acheson, one of the principal architects of the post-World War II international order; Douglas Dillon, a former investment banker, ambassador and secretary of the Treasury; Clark Clifford, Harry Truman’s White House counsel; and Henry Cabot Lodge, a former senator from Massachusetts, fresh from a two-year stint as ambassador to South Vietnam.The group met at the State Department on Nov. 1, where they were treated to high-level (and upbeat) military and intelligence briefings, which emphasized the progress that had been made since 1965. Assembling the next morning in the Cabinet Room, they were further fortified by an ebullient telegram from the American Embassy in Saigon. Acheson reported to the president that “this is a matter we can and will win” and “we certainly should not get out of Vietnam.” McGeorge Bundy, Johnson’s former national security adviser, quickly seconded Acheson’s comments, adding that pulling out was both “impossible” and “undesirable.” One by one the seasoned diplomats and storied military titans gathered around the table expressed variations of their general agreement with these sentiments.With unanimity on the imperative of the war, the discussion focused on three of the questions posed by Johnson in his opening comments — the merits of negotiations and bombing, and the problem of national unity. On each issue there was broad consensus: Negotiations would be pointless, halting the bombing would be seen as a sign of weakness, and the main problem was not with the war but with widespread public and political misperception about how it was going. Things took a slightly surreal turn when, near the end of the four-hour session, Johnson’s infant grandson was brought into the room and rested in the president’s arms for the balance of the meeting.Beneath this placid veneer, however, troubling rumbles threatened. It should have been obvious that one of the Wise Old Men, Omar Bradley — a World War II commander and the first chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — was hopelessly out of touch. Back from a recent trip to South Vietnam, he told the group he had “never seen better morale” and marveled that the troops “get ice cream about three times a week.” Averell Harriman, a former governor of New York and the globe-trotting ambassador at large, sent the president a quiet missive the following day dissenting from the notion that negotiations ought not to be pursued. And the meeting ended on a discordant note when, as the participants were filing out, the former undersecretary of state George Ball (a lone voice against the bombing campaign) snapped at his colleagues: “I’ve been watching you across the table. You’re like a flock of buzzards sitting on a fence, sending young men off to be killed. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.”But neither Ball nor Harriman expressed opposition to the war at the meeting, and a few weeks later Johnson solved his lingering problem with McNamara (whose most recent, deeply pessimistic memo anticipated that nothing the United States could do would “break the will” of the enemy) by dispatching him to the World Bank and replacing him with the steadfast hawk Clark Clifford. As far as the White House and the Wise Men were concerned, the problem was principally one of public relations. Several of the participants urged that the ambassador to South Vietnam, Ellsworth Bunker, and Gen. William Westmoreland be brought home to allay the public’s misconceptions.This was the one productive suggestion that emerged from the Wise Men meeting, and Johnson jumped on it. Westmoreland and Bunker were summoned to Washington to sell the war — or at least the idea that things were going very well indeed — a public relations push that included prominent speeches, appearances on television, and testimony before congressional committees. On Nov. 21, at a speech before the National Press Club, Westmoreland offered the big brass ring: He was “absolutely certain” the United States was winning a war of attrition, and the strength of the Viet Cong was “declining at a steady rate.” The war has “entered a new phase,” he announced, “when the end begins to come into view.”Ten weeks later, American forces were stunned by the Tet offensive, a major coordinated strike across all of South Vietnam, including attacks on 44 of the country’s 50 largest cities — a battle was fought on the grounds of the American Embassy in Saigon. In the first quarter of 1968 the Americans would suffer over 4,700 combat deaths. The offensive failed to achieve its military goals, but it made one thing perfectly clear: The end was not in view. For Robert Kennedy, the events “shattered the mask of official illusion” about the war; the CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite concluded it now seemed certain that “the bloody experience in Vietnam is to end in stalemate.”As Johnson was reeling from these blows, Westmoreland landed another — his urgent request for an additional 206,000 troops. The military commander informed the president that “a setback is fully possible if I am not reinforced and it is likely we will lose ground in other areas.” Taken aback, Johnson asked Clifford to study Westmoreland’s request with “fresh eyes.” Clifford resurfaced after a week of study and briefings. He reported he was now “convinced that the military course we were pursuing was not only endless, but hopeless.”Clifford urged the president to reconvene the Wise Men, who on March 25 received new briefings and then talked late into the night. They met with Johnson the following afternoon, assembling for what Clifford would later describe as “an unhappy occasion,” for “there could be no pleasure” in admitting “that their previous advice had been wrong.” McGeorge Bundy, the group’s youngest member, drew the short straw. “Mr. President, there has been a very significant shift in most of our positions since we last met,” he reported. A majority now held the view that “we must begin to take steps to disengage.” Five days later, Johnson stunned the nation with his announcement that he would not seek re-election.
Sade’s Quiet Storm of Cool Not long ago, a tattoo shop in Brooklyn got a bad review on Yelp. A customer was angry — not about his new ink, but about the soundtrack that accompanied his trip there.“Why are you playing Sade,” he wrote, inserting an expletive. This was music he found fit for “a plastic surgeon’s waiting room,” not a cool tattoo parlor.One can sort of understand where he was coming from.Before record stores neared extinction, Sade was often stocked in the easy listening section. The band’s breakout success in the 1980s owed much to the advent of adult contemporary radio, where huge hits like “Smooth Operator” and “The Sweetest Taboo” eventually got sandwiched between selections from Michael Bolton and Kenny G.But then and now, Sade had an appeal that lifted it far above the slush pile of schlock.The band’s trench-coat-favoring Nigerian-born frontwoman, Helen Adu, known to the world just as Sade, is more responsible for the popularizing of gold hoop earrings than an entire industry of jewelry executives. She did not so much wear polka dots as single-handedly rescue them from the dustbin of Upper West Side frumpiness.As a generation turned, house D.J.s turned remixes of Sade ballads into club classics, and a raft of hip-hop artists repeatedly sampled her.So when the owners of East River Tattoo fired back on Instagram, posting a screen shot of the Yelp review beside a caption that said, “Proud to be shattering your expectations of what a tattoo shop should be, every day of the week,” obviously an army of Sade obsessives rushed to the store’s side.“All that says is your understanding of the world and what’s happening in it... Is shall we say, limited lol,” one wrote.Sade is one of the most relentlessly quiet famous people on the planet. But in her extended silences, her place in the pantheon of cultural influence has only grown more enormous.This impact includes tattoos. More than 20 East River Tattoo clients have had their bodies adorned with Ms. Adu’s visage over the last year or so. A manager noted that that was 20 more requests than they’d gotten for Madonna and Janet Jackson.The most famous Sade tattoo, however, belongs to Drake. He premiered it on Instagram this March. In it, Ms. Adu’s hair is hidden, Nina Simone-like, beneath a turban.In February 2017, the street wear brand Supreme put Ms. Adu’s image on a coveted limited-edition T-shirt. In March, Reese Witherspoon’s Type A character on “Big Little Lies” established her remove from pop culture when she hears Sade at a dinner party and mistakes it for Adele.Demand for T-shirts from Sade’s 1992 and 2001 tours has so outstripped supply that vintage sellers like Chico’s Closet in Los Angeles have largely abandoned eBay (and its commission fees) and moved to Instagram, where the mere act of hashtagging Sade leads to whack-a-mole-like sales.Some of this Sade fever can be traced to Patrick Matamoros, 41, a high-end dealer who finds rare T-shirts, distresses them to perfection and then places them on to the backs of celebrity clients such as Rihanna, Diplo and Mark Ronson.Two years ago, Mr. Matamoros sold a tee from Sade’s 1993 Love Deluxe tour to Kanye West. “I’d sold Sade shirts to famous people before that, but something happens when Kanye wears a shirt that I still don’t understand,” Mr. Matamoros said on a recent afternoon.This conversation was in his Lower East Side apartment, and he was in a Run-DMC shirt and a Sade crew hat that he sells for as much as $600.He picked up a vintage Phil Spector shirt and poked a hole through one of the sleeves with his big toe.“I used to say to people about Sade, ‘This isn’t going to impress everyone in the room,” Mr. Matamoros said. “Get an Iron Maiden shirt if that’s what you want. Sade was for two people in the room, but it was the right two people.”Not anymore. Now, everyone wants them and Mr. Matamoros says even he rarely gets them without paying at least $300 a pop, which happens to be more than any other female singer alive today.Much of the current fascination with Sade derives from the fact that her fans know so little about her, starting with the pronunciation of her name. (Many Americans believe it’s pronounced Shar-day; it’s Sha-day.) In an era that rewards people less for their talent than for their associations with other famous people and the ability to leverage those associations over Instagram and Twitter, Sade’s disinterest in self-promotion has had a reverse effect.Her longstanding lack of interest in speaking about herself makes the world more likely to want to speak about her.For college, Ms. Adu went to what is now called Central Saint Martins, in London, then and now the world’s most prestigious fashion school. To make extra money, said Albert Watson, who photographed the covers of the band’s “Love Deluxe” and “Lover’s Rock” albums, Ms. Adu took a job selling clothes at the Camden Street Market.She began singing backup in a local band, and moved to frontwoman only reluctantly. “The lead singer left,” she later said.It turned out she was great, with a breathy voice that was heard by Stuart Matthewman and Paul Denman, playing in a band called Pride. They asked Ms. Adu to start singing with them.In 1982 or 1983, Mr. Matthewman and Mr. Denman left Pride and formed a group around Sade.They signed to Epic Records, where executives quickly realized they were dealing with an artist with no direct historical precedent.“She was one of those rare artists I fell completely in love with because she came just the way she is now,” said Susan Blond, a former vice president and publicity director at Epic who now heads an agency where clients have included Aerosmith, Will.I.Am and Morrissey.“She was very young, but she was very sophisticated,” Ms. Blond said. “She didn’t follow anyone else’s style. No one was as beautiful or had as sleek of a look as her. She didn’t mind designer clothes, but you’d never ever look at her and say, ‘Oh that’s a Chanel outfit.’ She never looked like a brand. And her songs seemed to become classics immediately.”In a way, Ms. Adu’s sphinx-y stare, keen fashion sense and interest in Afro-Caribbean rhythms owed a debt to Grace Jones, but her pensive lyrics and languid delivery of them flipped the script by placing romance above sex.When Ms. Adu sang about a male gigolo on her breakout hit, “Smooth Operator,” she was lamenting what happens when “sentiment is left to chance.”The saxophone signaled sorrow. Ms. Adu wasn’t asking — as Ms. Jones did — for a guy to “drive it in between.”Shortly before Sade won the 1986 Grammy for best new artist, she appeared on “Saturday Night Live” with Tom Hanks, who recalled the experience in an email: “It was the first time I did ‘SNL,’ which is a major event an anyone’s life, a heady week of being surrounded by all that history. I’d never been in 30 Rock, much less invited to work on the 17th floor or in Studio 8-H. I thought the big talisman for being on ‘SNL’ was the job of saying ‘Ladies and Gentlemen, Sade.’ which is actually written on a cue card, by the way.’Calling her elusive or mysterious might color her as unkind or remote. She was not that. She was, rather, just very comfortable in her command of her art, as well as her presence. Having very little in common with her, save the close approximation of dressing quarters, a bit of me yearned to be as cool and composed as Sade. She remains a Smooth Operator, no?”Dan Beck, a former senior vice president at Epic who worked on the United States promotion for Sade’s first four albums, said, “There was grace to everything she did.”Although Ms. Adu looked forward to the publicity campaigns of record releases about as much as one would a root canal, Mr. Beck said, this wasn’t because she was temperamental or diva-ish.She merely regarded the project of explication with suspicion. She seemed to operate according to the principle that narcissism was not the precondition for artistic exploration, but was instead its enemy.“She never enjoyed promotion of any type,” Mr. Beck said. “It was painful for her. Eventually, I flew over to London to see her and we struck a deal. I said that if she would commit to giving me three weeks of nonstop publicity for each album, everything but the kitchen sink, VH1 and radio stuff and photo shoots, I would go back to my counterparts at the label and get them to put everything they needed into that time period. I said, ‘You’ll hate it but we’ll get it all done and when you’re done you’re done.’ And she laughed, and that’s what we did for the next two albums after that.”(She and her bandmates also hired the manager Roger Davies, who guided the second half of Tina Turner’s career and long understood that mystery equaled timelessness.)As the years went by, the break between albums stretched ever longer. She wanted to have normal relationships. She wanted to record when she actually had something to say.Sade’s 1992 album, “Love Deluxe,” arrived four years after “Stronger Than Pride.” Ms. Adu smiled as she told Mr. Beck she might not have gone back into the studio to record — except the guys in the band wanted to return to work, he said. “I thought that was so sweet.” (In a 1992 interview she said, “It’s good that we stopped and didn’t try to make another one off the back of the previous album. You get some perspective on why you’re making a record.”)Then, she did the photo shoot for the album and Mr. Watson, a contributor to Vogue who directed a number of Sade’s videos, proposed shooting her topless with metallic body paint, her hands covering her chest.“She said, ‘I don’t mind. I’ll do that for you, but I don’t want it to be anywhere near the album cover,’” Mr. Watson said. “I said, ‘The shoot is for you. You control all the images.’ Then she looked at it and said it was too sexy.” Eventually, in conversation with the band, she agreed to use it, but the image remains an outlier in the way she has chosen to display herself.A year later, Sade declined to release a house remix of “Pearls,” perhaps because there was something a little unseemly about people dancing to a song about the Somalian civil war. Then, a bootleg of it began making the rounds to D.J.s such as Junior Vasquez and Frankie Knuckles, who turned it into one of the era’s defining club tracks.In 1995, a marriage to the Spanish film director Carlos Pliego ended. Ms. Adu later said the pair had a difficult time navigating the demands of global fame with their private relationship. For a time, she lived in Jamaica with Bob Morgan, and they had a child.An eight-year stretch between albums yielded “Lover’s Rock,” which had lots about romance but also brought a quiet force to songs about issues facing black people. The video for “King of Sorrow” was a masterstroke of Sade-ness, where she wore ball gowns and a bandanna, scrubbing a child’s shoe clean. Was it a cautionary tale for single parenthood or a fashion spread devoted to it? Who could say. It was lovely.By the mid-aughts, Ms. Adu had become involved with a former fireman named Ian Watts. With one child each, they had settled into a countryside cottage near Stroud, England.All this time, in luxurious quiet, her legend grew. The parasitic music business had driven many black female singers to seclusion, before Sade. The difference was that Ms. Adu appeared not to be combusting but thriving.Her fans yearned for more material, all the while respecting her resolute privacy.One secret to her absence is that it is not so total as to be suspicious. Tours in 2001 and 2011 showed her to be in fine form. (And the time away only helped build interest. The first tour for her 2001 album, “Lover’s Rock,” grossed $26 million. The second, for “Soldier of Love,” grossed $50 million.)In 2012 Mr. Watson had a retrospective in Hamburg, and Ms. Adu flew in without any pomp or circumstance. She simply treated it as if she was showing up for a friend and smiled luminously as she sat with him in her trademark earrings, silk shirt and jeans.When the exhibition was too crowded to really view the work, she returned the following morning to see it again, Mr. Watson said.Ms. Adu can also sometimes be spotted on her cat-loving child’s Instagram. On Mother’s Day this year, this undated portrait was published. Back in January, on the day she turned 58, a recent picture appeared. She looks impeccably happy.Even with so little of her, you can see her look everywhere. Just last week, T:, The New York Times Style Magazine put Nicki Minaj on a cover, her hair in a black ponytail, a pair of gold hoops dangling.Lauren Tabach-Bank, the magazine’s entertainment director, didn’t hesitate when asked whom they were channeling. “Sade,” she said. “You never know how someone’s going to react, but Sade is universally respected and lauded by musicians of all genres. Nicki saw the images and was like, ‘Sade, Oh my God. I love it.’ It felt expensive, cool and timeless.”There’s talk of a Sade album coming next year, but even Mr. Watson, who sees her with some regularity, says he isn’t sure.“It’s always like that with Sade,” he said. “Time will go by and she’ll start working on it. For her, it’s like getting out of bed on a Sunday morning. You know you don’t want to do it, but at some point you just do it.”“When we were having our first success with her, I said, ‘This lady could have a hit album when she’s 90 years old.’ Most artists try too hard,” Mr. Beck said. “And consciously or unconsciously, I think people have a special appreciation for someone who isn’t out there waving their résumé at you every five minutes. She’s completely unique.”
Xi Jinping Vows No Poverty in China by 2020. That Could Be Hard. CHASHAN, China — From his home in the mountains of northeast China, Li Zhi has watched from a distance as prosperity has transformed China into a land of high-speed trains, billionaires and skyscrapers.But the economic boom that made China rich never came to Chashan, a desolate village of 40 people about a six-hour drive from Beijing. Mr. Li, 72, spends his days limping along dusty roads to collect trash in exchange for tips. Stiff and gaunt, he subsists on a diet of rice, steamed bread and hard liquor.“The country doesn’t care for me,” Mr. Li said as he rolled a cigarette in his home. “Nobody cares for me.”Nearly seven decades after the Chinese Communist Party rose to power on a promise of prosperity for all, President Xi Jinping has vowed to fulfill the Communists’ original intent, staking his legacy on an ambitious plan to complete the eradication of rural poverty by 2020.The plan targets the more than 43 million people who still live on the equivalent of less than 95 cents a day, the poverty line set by the Chinese government. Five years ago, about 100 million people lived below that line, according to official statistics.Mr. Xi, who cemented his status last week alongside Mao as one of China’s most powerful modern leaders, sees improving living standards as essential to quelling frustration over inequality, and assuring the party’s grip on power during what the president has billed as a new era of national strength.But Mr. Xi’s lofty vision clashes with a harsh reality across much of rural China. In many villages, young people have gone, leaving older residents to fend for themselves. Disparities in education, health care and social services remain stark.Even as Chinese cities have turned into playgrounds for the nouveau riche and the swelling ranks of the middle class, nearly 500 million people, or about 40 percent of China’s population, live on less than $5.50 per day, according to the World Bank.“The whole idea of socialism was that all Chinese would have a reasonable living standard,” said Kerry Brown, a China scholar at King’s College London. “The nagging concern is that the Communist Party has created billionaires and a strong middle class, and yet there are still a lot of poor people. That seems to be a massive contradiction.”As China works to modernize its economy, it faces the reality that the world’s newest superpower remains a developing nation with a huge poverty problem. Experts say that a slowing economy and loss of manufacturing jobs could add to strains on low-income families, undermining Mr. Xi’s vision.Under Mr. Xi, who has played up an image as an Everyman, the fight against poverty has become a national mantra. The state-run news media routinely shows Mr. Xi visiting poor villages, sampling the food and water and checking on the health of residents. The evening news is filled with tales of rejuvenated communities, and villagers-turned-entrepreneurs heaping praise on Mr. Xi and the government for providing loans and new apartments.On Wednesday, during a speech marking the beginning of his second five-year term as party leader, Mr. Xi described eradicating poverty by 2020 as one of his chief priorities, vowing to “leave no one behind in the march toward common prosperity.”Mr. Xi has also used the fight against poverty to strengthen China’s global alliances, financing programs in Africa and Southeast Asia, and urging the world to learn from China’s experience.Now Mr. Xi faces pressure to deliver.“Xi Jinping is a prisoner of expectations,” Professor Brown said. “His problem is not the fears of Chinese people but the hopes of Chinese people.”While international organizations like the United Nations and the World Bank have praised the government’s work in helping hundreds of millions of Chinese rise out of poverty in recent decades, some experts worry that Mr. Xi’s plan is more about making headlines than bringing lasting change to poor communities.Some say the government’s focus on 43 million people is too narrow, noting that millions more live just above the official poverty line in conditions that are not much better. Others say that by concentrating on rural areas, Mr. Xi is neglecting the plight of the urban poor, many of whom are rural migrants.“The government’s initiatives sound good,” said Qin Gao, a professor at Columbia University who studies Chinese social policy. “But the question is how to sustain poverty reduction. Some people may be looking to quick fixes rather than really addressing poverty.”Mr. Xi has instructed officials to focus on alleviating poverty in rural places like Chashan, where farming conditions are poor, access to basic social services is limited and residents struggle with heart disease and other ailments without a clinic nearby.For centuries, Chashan, nestled in the mountains about 6,400 feet above sea level, has been home to farmers who plant wheat and yams and raise pigs and sheep on dry terrain.The government is trying to turn the village into a tourist destination, but so far only a trickle of visitors have come. The town is hard to reach and lacks modern facilities.Many residents said they had virtually no income and that subsidies from the government were inadequate.“There’s no way out,” said Li Chao, 70, a farmer who has struggled with blood clots in his legs. “I can’t earn any money.”Li Zhi, the trash collector, relies on donations from the few tourists for food and clothing. A calligraphy banner reading “Wealth will come” hangs in his home. He said he remains dubious that he will ever be able to buy his own clothes.“It’s impossible to eliminate poverty,” he said.The government has used a variety of approaches to help bring people out of poverty, devoting tens of billions of dollars to the effort and more than $370 billion in loans. Local officials, who are judged partly on their success in improving living standards, are working feverishly to meet Mr. Xi’s deadline.Some villages have experimented with rural cooperatives, allowing families to raise production by pooling labor and resources. State-owned banks have provided microloans to help villagers tap into China’s e-commerce boom by selling embroidered dresses and other goods online.But the hardest work remains ahead. As many as half of the 43 million people who are officially classified as in poverty could be disabled, according to the government. The campaign must also move into areas that have been chronically poor for generations, including many that are home to ethnic minorities.Officials in these areas are resettling villagers near cities in government-provided apartments, sometimes against their will. They are handing out cash subsidies to disabled residents. And they are following Mr. Xi’s call for a “targeted” approach, tracking the progress of individual residents on giant bulletin boards in town centers.Corruption has emerged as a problem, with more than 1,800 people having been investigated last year for embezzling antipoverty funds and related crimes, according to official statistics. Scholars have also cast doubt on the reliability of some data, saying some local officials appear to be understating poverty rates amid intense pressure to meet Mr. Xi’s targets.Then there is the fact that Mr. Xi’s campaign is not focused on urban areas. There are more than 200 million rural migrants in China’s cities, where many struggle to receive education, heath care and other benefits because the local government does not consider them residents. Some fall into unemployment or bad health and live in squalid conditions.“This is a very big hole in the overall picture, which the government rarely addresses,” said Philip G. Alston, a scholar and adviser to the United Nations who issued a report this year on extreme poverty and human rights in China. “The reality is that many of them are living in extreme poverty.”On a street corner in downtown Beijing, Gu Xin, 63, sat on a flattened cardboard box begging for money. Mr. Gu moved to the city from central China six months ago, only to find himself unable to get steady work after his back was injured in a construction accident.As he bowed to passers-by, a propaganda sign flashed in the background: “Without the Communist Party, there is no new China.” Mr. Gu said he had no choice but to ask strangers for money so that he could pay medical bills and support his family.“I can’t live here,” he said. “I don’t know where to go.”
A Train Called Anne Frank? German Railway Plan Prompts Outcry Toward the end of 1944, after the Gestapo raided the Amsterdam canal house where they had hidden, Anne Frank and her family were crammed into a cattle wagon on a train bound for Auschwitz.Now, 73 years after she boarded that wagon, leaving behind a diary that would one day be read around the world, Deutsche Bahn has announced that it plans to name a new high-speed train after her.The idea of Germany’s state rail operator claiming one of the most enduring symbols of the Holocaust has prompted an outcry.Mirja Wenzel, director of the Jewish Museum in Frankfurt, the city of Anne Frank’s birth, was among those on social media attacking the decision, writing on Twitter that it was “based on historical amnesia.”A statement from the Anne Frank House, the museum that preserves the family’s hiding place in Amsterdam, noted that the combination of a train and her name was “painful for people who experienced these deportations and causes fresh pain for those who still bear the consequences of those times within them.”Anne Frank’s memory continues to have great symbolic power, the museum said: That was why her name has been used for streets, schools and parks, but also to create tasteless Halloween costumes and in anti-Semitic taunts by soccer fans.Deutsche Bahn defended its decision, saying that it was an attempt to honor an “exceptional person.”“It was not our intention at D.B. to disrespect the memory of Anne Frank in any way whatsoever,” it said in a statement on Monday. “On the contrary — aware of the historical responsibility we bear, we made a deliberate decision to help keep Anne Frank’s memory alive. We are very sorry if any feelings were hurt as a result of this decision.”It said it was now engaged in an “internal discussion” about the concerns raised, in consultation with Jewish organizations.Some of those who discussed the naming idea on Twitter agreed that it might be a powerful memorial.Deutsche Bahn was created in its modern form in 1994, with the consolidation of state railway companies from the former East and West Germany. Its predecessor during the Nazi era, the Deutsche Reichsbahn, deported millions of Jews to their deaths, and was broken up after the war ended.Deutsche Bahn said that in September it had asked members of the public to give suggestions for names for its fourth generation of high-speed trains, receiving 19,400 responses, and that Anne Frank was among the most popular suggestions.A jury of railway employees and historians narrowed the possibilities to 25 names, published last week, which also included Beethoven, Einstein, Karl Marx, Marlene Dietrich, and the philosopher Hannah Arendt, among other notable figures. Gisela Mettele, a historian and member of the jury, said the group was united in that they were “curious about the world.”The new trains are scheduled to start entering full service in December.The Franks hid from the Nazis in a secret annex of the house in Amsterdam for two years, and were found by the Gestapo in August 1944. Only Anne’s father, Otto Frank, survived: He returned to Amsterdam after the liberation of Auschwitz and published her diary.On the night of Nov. 1, 1944, Anne and her sister Margot were deported by train in an overcrowded cattle wagon to the Bergen Belsen concentration camp in Germany. Anne Frank, then 15, died there of typhus in February 1945, shortly after Margot, who died around her 19th birthday, according to the Anne Frank House.Anne Frank’s “Diary of a Young Girl” has sold 30 million copies and has been translated into 67 languages.
Thanks to Wall St., There May Be Too Many Restaurants PLAINFIELD, Ill. — The way Marcus Mooney saw it, he wasn’t just selling hot dogs — he was selling experiences.In addition to the classics — a cheese dog and a chili dog — his restaurant, Frank’s Night Out, served hot dogs topped with more exotic ingredients, like a “Surf & Turf Dog” featuring crumbles of garlic-basted Maine lobster.But the hot dog experiences Mr. Mooney offered were just one choice among hundreds for hungry motorists seeking a quick, inexpensive meal on this restaurant-laden stretch of Illinois Highway 59. His sales dropped. After opening his restaurant in 2013 and putting in seven-day work weeks, Mr. Mooney shuttered it last year.“There becomes a point where there’s too many choices,” Mr. Mooney said recently. “The more restaurants that opened up, the more it took away from business for us.”After a prolonged stretch of explosive growth, fueled by interest from Wall Street, experts say there are now too many fast-food, casual and other chain restaurants.Since the early 2000s, banks, private equity firms and other financial institutions have poured billions into the restaurant industry as they sought out more tangible enterprises than the dot-com start-ups that were going belly-up. There are now more than 620,000 eating and drinking places in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the number of restaurants is growing at about twice the rate of the population.That trend is evident on a more local level here in the sprawling suburbs southwest of Chicago, where the population is growing fast, but the number of restaurants is growing even faster. Twenty years ago, Mr. Mooney would have been competing against about 600 eateries in the region; by the end of last year, that number had more than doubled.“Everybody thinks their brand has what it takes to succeed in the marketplace,” said Victor Fernandez, an industry analyst with TDn2K, a Dallas-based firm that gathers data on the chain restaurant industry. “You look at a location that looks good, but everybody is looking at the same place and they all come in, and the result is you get oversaturation.”The glut of restaurants has increased the pressure on individual restaurant owners. Industry sales are up nationally, but growth has slowed to the lowest rate since 2010.Customers continue to spend a large share of their food budget in restaurants, but they’re spreading the money across a larger number of establishments, so profits are split into smaller individual pieces. Yet the industry — particularly chain restaurants — continues to expand, a strategy that both masks the problem and makes it likely that more places will falter.Sales at individual chain restaurants, compared with a year earlier, began dropping in early 2016, analysts reported. A majority of restaurants reported sales growth in just four of the last 22 monthly surveys from the National Restaurant Association. Before that, most restaurants had reported growth for 20 consecutive months, from March 2014 through October 2015, the survey found.As Americans work longer hours and confront an ever-growing array of food options, they are spending a growing share of their food budget — about 44 cents per dollar — on restaurants, according to food economists at the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service.But while consumer demand contributed to the restaurant boom, it was changes on Wall Street that really fueled the explosion. Chains like Del Taco, Papa Murphy’s and others began attracting money from private equity firms, and banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America saw lending opportunities in the restaurant industry.Those developments complemented each other well. New fast-food investors wanted to rely less on owning restaurants, and offloaded many company locations to eager buyers who came with bags of cheap money from the banks. The investors could then count on a steady stream of franchise fees and royalty payments — buffers against overall sales declines if, say, the market ever became oversaturated. And they didn’t have to worry about actually operating the restaurants.Franchisees pay for the right to operate a McDonald’s or a Subway, following rules that dictate everything from what type of taco to sell to where to buy iceberg lettuce. They take on the risks and costs of running the restaurants, in exchange for the marketing muscle and name recognition these big companies provide. While every Dunkin’ Donuts or Taco Bell may look the same, dozens and sometimes hundreds of independent owners can operate most of the restaurants within a single brand.But some franchisees say they’re being pressured to open too many stores as food companies push for new revenue streams. Buying an existing restaurant, for example, may mean agreeing to build 10 new ones.“They want us to sign aggressive development agreements,” said Shoukat Dhanani, the chief executive officer of the Dhanani Group, which owns hundreds of Burger King and Popeyes restaurants. “I didn’t see that even five years ago.”The shuttering of restaurants could have a major impact on the labor market. Since 2010, restaurants have accounted for one out of every seven new jobs, and many restaurateurs complain that it has become increasingly difficult to hire and retain workers. In Muscogee County, Ga., a former textile center, the Labor Department reported an overall decline in employment of 2,000 jobs since 2001 — but a gain of 2,700 restaurant jobs.Those positions could be in jeopardy if sales continue to fall and force more restaurants to close. Over the summer, the parent company of Applebee’s announced it would close more than 100 locations. In 2016 Subway, the nation’s largest fast-food chain by location count, closed more locations than it opened, the first time in its history that had happened.“Year over year, we are seeing chain restaurants grow at twice the rate of overall population growth,” said Mr. Fernandez, the TDn2K analyst. “We believe now there are probably too many restaurants and too many brands.”In this business environment, restaurant owners are often risking their personal fortunes when they open a Pizza Hut or create their own idea for a restaurant, like Frank’s Night Out.Melissa Arcache also plowed her life savings into her dream of running a successful restaurant. She now owns three branches of Bahama Buck’s, an island-themed frozen dessert chain decorated with surfboards and novelty mileage signs listing the distance to Bermuda and the Bimini Islands, in the Houston area.Even before Hurricane Harvey hit Texas, Ms. Arcache was struggling. Sales in August were down 10 percent from last year, and business fell further after the storm. She looks at all of the competitors opening up shop nearby and wonders what she can do.She said she doesn’t have a Plan B.“This is what we’re going to make work,” Ms. Arcache said during an interview at her store in Houston, which was recently vandalized, leaving behind dents in the walls she has yet to patch up. “This is what’s going to feed my future kids and hopefully get them through college,” she said.Mr. Mooney also put his life savings into his restaurant, Frank’s Night Out, only to see it fail. His personal life suffered, too — he was married when Frank’s opened but divorced by the time it closed.He now works as head chef for a company that owns a brewery and restaurant in the same strip mall where Frank’s Night Out was located, and passes by his old restaurant on his way to work.Transformed into a beef and gyro shop, the new establishment sells one of the items he created, a hot dog wrapped in bacon and topped with macaroni and cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. It even has the same name — the “Deep South Dog.”At first, Mr. Mooney said, he felt relief when he looked in and saw few customers. “It allows you to think that the failure of it was not you,” he said.But nine months later he’s rooting for the new restaurant to succeed.“Now it’s kind of like, oh, man, I’m glad people are going in,” he said.
Manafort Is the Tip of the Iceberg As a tax professor who specializes in anti-money laundering, what is most striking to me about the criminal indictment against Paul Manafort and Rick Gates is how easy they made it look to launder nearly $20 million dollars from prying government eyes over a period of nearly 10 years.As far as I can tell, the only reason this alleged tax evasion was brought to light is that they were being investigated by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, and his team for any connections to Russian interference in the presidential election. If they hadn’t been involved in the Trump campaign, according to the indictment, they might very well have gotten away with a truly spectacular tax fraud.The indictment does not apply only to those individuals, though. It also applies to the way taxpayers declare income accumulating in foreign bank accounts of companies that they own.How do you go about hiding nearly $20 million over a decade? In this case, first, according to the indictment, between the two of them, Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates set up over 30 companies and partnerships in the United States and abroad. These entities opened bank accounts in Cyprus, the Grenadines and Britain.Instead of making payments for services directly to the United States bank accounts of Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates, their Ukrainian clients sent money to those foreign bank accounts.There’s nothing illegal or immoral about that. But to prevent people from sheltering that income from United States tax, the Internal Revenue Code requires owners of those companies to report that income on their tax returns. According to the indictment, Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates did not.Instead of those companies’ sending funds to Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates to go buy things, the companies did the buying on their behalf — all kinds of luxury consumer goods and, even better, in Mr. Manafort’s case, millions of dollars of real estate. Not surprisingly, the Internal Revenue Code would also require Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates to declare the value of these goods, services and investments as income.But again, they didn’t. The real issue here isn’t what the I.R.S. says is income. The real issue is how that code is enforced. And this is where things really break down.There are a few ways that United States law seeks to make taxpayers declare company income in foreign bank accounts. This is where the indictment implicates both Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates and these techniques.First, United States anti-money laundering laws require that citizens file a form, a Foreign Bank and Financials Account report, if they control (including through a company or other legal entity) foreign bank account worth over a total of $10,000.Next, income tax Form 1040, Schedule B, Part III also requires taxpayers to check a box if they held a foreign account. According to the indictment, neither Mr. Manafort nor Mr. Gates did so. In other words, they refused to rat themselves out to the I.R.S. that they were engaging in tax evasion. What a surprise.In addition, the United States has embarked on a policy in which it has enlisted (at the tip of a metaphorical bayonet) foreign banks to report to the United States government when its taxpayers control an account. However, the Manafort-Gates duo was allegedly careful to hide their control of their corporations and partnerships by having so-called nominee owners (the actual owner “nominates” someone else as owner). Presumably, they failed to inform those banks that they were the actual owners. In other words, once again, they refused to rat themselves out.Of course, failure to file those forms or check those boxes is a crime in itself and punishable with a penalty. But it’s hard to imagine that additional penalties would sway the committed tax evader. It is, however, easy to see how honest people can be punished if they unintentionally fail to file forms or check boxes, exposing them to investigations and penalties that were never meant to apply to them.Fortunately, there is a better way. Both United States law and global anti-money laundering standards require banks to report suspicious activity to government law enforcement agencies. Millions of dollars paid by dodgy Ukrainians to unknown companies in Cyprus and then to luxury car dealers in the United States for no known legal reason would certainly seem to qualify.These enforcement mechanisms need to be strengthened, and vastly so. In the cases of Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates and no doubt many others with millions tucked away in offshore banks, they did not result — in the absence of a special counsel — in an investigation of years of possible crimes, or an indictment.Relying on self-reporting by those who are committing tax evasion is a fool’s errand.
New Accusers Expand Harvey Weinstein Sexual Assault Claims Back to ’70s Hope Exiner d’Amore said Harvey Weinstein raped her in a hotel room in the 1970s, when he was a young concert promoter in Buffalo. Cynthia Burr said that during this time, he assaulted her in an encounter that began in an elevator and ended with forced oral sex in a hallway. Ashley Matthau, a dancer with a bit part in one of his movies, said that in 2004, he pushed her down on a bed and masturbated while straddling her. Days later, she said, he paid her to remain silent.Three weeks after complaints of sexual harassment and misconduct by Mr. Weinstein were first reported in The New York Times, women from different continents, fields and generations have come forward with allegations of rape, sexual assault and groping. New accounts include one previously undisclosed settlement with Mr. Weinstein and expand the time frame of alleged wrongdoing to the 1970s.Together, the accounts provide a widening tally of alleged abuses, and illustrate the toll on women who say they felt ashamed and isolated as they watched the Hollywood producer walk red carpets, pile up Oscars and showcase his ties to prominent figures.“This has haunted me my entire life,” said Ms. Exiner d’Amore, now 62, who was in her early 20s at the time of the alleged rape.She and three other women who spoke to The Times described Mr. Weinstein as inappropriate and unrelenting. Some said that he used the pretext of work to lure them to hotels, that he touched them or forced them into unwanted sexual activity and that he wouldn’t stop when they said no.Ms. Matthau, the dancer who reached a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, said she was willing to break its confidentiality clause even if it meant that he might pursue legal damages. “I want to do my part to help bring this to light so it doesn’t happen with other people in Hollywood or anywhere else,” she said in an interview.The allegations add to those previously documented in The Times, The New Yorker and elsewhere.Last week, the actress Dominique Huett filed a lawsuit claiming that in 2010, Mr. Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her. The same day, Mimi Haleyi, a former production assistant of Mr. Weinstein’s, appeared at a news conference in New York accusing him of the same behavior in 2006.The New York Police Department is conducting a wide-ranging investigation of allegations against Mr. Weinstein. Detectives with expertise in old cases are reviewing complaints that have come through the department’s hotline, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.In New York, the statute of limitations for prosecuting rape and other sex crimes depends on the force alleged and the charges considered, but it can range from two years to no time restrictions for the most serious offenses. Ms. Burr, the woman involved in the hallway encounter in the 1970s, said that she contacted the New York police in recent weeks and that they told her the alleged assault had happened too long ago to be prosecuted.Women have also spoken to law enforcement authorities in London, Los Angeles and elsewhere in the United States. The London police are investigating three sexual assault cases involving Mr. Weinstein, ranging from the 1980s to 2015.Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said in a statement that “any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.”For 40 years, Cynthia Burr has almost never talked about the time she met Mr. Weinstein.But she didn’t forget how he greeted her in the lobby of a beautiful old building in New York City. How he tried to kiss her in the elevator. And how, she said, he unzipped his fly and forced her to perform oral sex in a hallway.“It was just him and me alone,” she said. “I was fearful I didn’t have the wherewithal to get away.”It was the late 1970s, and Ms. Burr was an actress in her early 20s. Mr. Weinstein was in his mid-20s and a “real up-and-comer,” Ms. Burr remembers. Her manager said they should meet.After the encounter, she recalls feeling ashamed. “The way he forced me made me feel really bad about myself,” she said. “What are you going to do when you are a girl just trying to make it as an actress? Nobody would have believed me.”Ms. Burr, now 62, went on to build a career in Hollywood. She appeared in “Scarface” and the first two “Lethal Weapon” films, and in soap operas and other television shows.Eventually, she told her husband, now deceased, and a close friend, Lee Chavez, what had happened. Mr. Chavez confirmed that she had told him her account about 10 years ago.“I’m really sad for everybody, but I’m really glad it’s out in the open,” Ms. Burr said about learning of the other allegations against Mr. Weinstein. “I finally felt like I had a voice.”Ms. Exiner d’Amore had worked for Mr. Weinstein for just a few weeks when he asked if she’d like to take a trip to New York City. Both of them were in their 20s, living in Buffalo in the late 1970s.She was working for Mr. Weinstein’s concert promotion company, Harvey and Corky Productions, doing odd jobs. She was interested in film, so when Mr. Weinstein asked if she wanted to come to New York City to meet with people in the industry, she agreed.When they got to the Park Lane Hotel, Mr. Weinstein went to the check-in desk while she waited elsewhere in the lobby, Ms. Exiner d’Amore recalled. He returned and said there had been a mistake with the reservations; there was only one room. They would have to share.“I gave him a look like that was ridiculous,” she recalled. But she ultimately agreed, assuming it was harmless. When she got into bed that night, she said, he slipped in next to her, naked.“I told him no. I kept pushing him away. He just wouldn’t listen,” Ms. Exiner d’Amore said. “He just forced himself on me.” She said he forcibly performed oral sex and intercourse on her.She did not tell her boyfriend, feeling ashamed, but she did confide in her next-door neighbors in Buffalo. She did not specifically say she was raped, but the couple, David and Irene Sipos, told The Times that they remembered her being extremely upset and crying when she told them about Mr. Weinstein and the hotel room.After the trip, Ms. Exiner d’Amore said, Mr. Weinstein kept asking her out and offered her credit cards to go on shopping sprees. She declined. Within three or four weeks, she was fired.“It was a relief,” she said. “I hated being there.”Ms. Exiner d’Amore never went into the film industry. She got a job administering an undergraduate program at Cornell, and later moved on to jobs in fund-raising.Ashley Matthau said that Mr. Weinstein was aggressive with her the moment they met in 2004. She was in Puerto Rico performing in “Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights” when Mr. Weinstein visited the set. As soon as he saw her, she said, he began pressuring her to come to his hotel room for a private meeting. Ms. Matthau, who then went by her maiden name, Anderson, said she tried to brush him off, explaining that she was engaged. She said he persisted.When the cast broke for a meal, Ms. Matthau told some production members that Mr. Weinstein was being pushy and she was afraid. No one offered to help, she said, and when she returned to the set, Mr. Weinstein instructed her to get into a car.“‘Don’t worry,’” Ms. Matthau, now 36, remembers him saying as they sat in the back seat. “‘Nothing is going to happen. We’re just going to discuss future projects.’”She said they went to his hotel room, where talk quickly became sexual: Mr. Weinstein told her that he had helped launch the careers of high-profile actresses who had slept with him, and that she should consider doing the same. When she declined, Mr. Weinstein pushed her onto the bed and fondled her breasts, she said. He then stripped, straddled her and masturbated on top of her.“I kept telling him, ‘Stop, I’m engaged,’ but he kept saying: ‘It’s just a little cuddling. It’s not a problem. It’s not like we’re having sex.’ ”Back in California days later, Ms. Matthau tearfully told her fiancé, Charles Matthau, a general description of what had happened. Mr. Matthau said in an interview that he was outraged. With his encouragement, Ms. Matthau retained John S. West, a partner in the law firm of Gloria Allred, who has a record of taking on powerful men.Soon, Ms. Matthau recalled, she and Mr. West met at the Peninsula Beverly Hills with Mr. Weinstein and Daniel M. Petrocelli, who had represented high-profile clients including Jeffrey Skilling, the chief executive of Enron.The experience, she said, was chilling. She had attended a couple of parties at the Playboy Mansion, and Mr. Petrocelli said she would be painted as promiscuous if she went public with her accusation against Mr. Weinstein.“‘We’ll drag you through the mud by your hair,’” she recalled the lawyer saying. Mr. Petrocelli declined to comment.Going up against such powerful men felt like more than she could handle. Ms. Matthau said she agreed to enter into a more than $100,000 settlement with Mr. Weinstein in exchange for a legally binding promise never to speak of the allegations again.Lacey Dorn moved to New York City in 2011, soon after graduating from Stanford University, where she had helped create two documentaries. Ms. Dorn, then 22, was introduced to Mr. Weinstein at a New York Film Festival partyA few weeks later, Ms. Dorn attended a Halloween party at the Gramercy Park Hotel and ran into Mr. Weinstein, who asked for her email. He wanted to talk about her career over lunch, she said.“Great meeting you,” he wrote in the subject line of an otherwise blank email sent to her at 12:26 a.m.On her way out of the party, Ms. Dorn said goodbye to Mr. Weinstein. As she turned her back to him, he grabbed between her legs, touching her buttocks and crotch through her clothes.“I was so naïve, I didn’t say anything. And he didn’t say anything either,” she said. “I just got out of the party as fast as possible.”Ms. Dorn said she never heard from Mr. Weinstein and never spoke to him again. Ms. Dorn said that when she told friends what had happened, many seemed to shrug it off as if it were a “rite of passage,” an acknowledgment of how “awful” the entertainment business could be.
John Kelly Pins Civil War on a ‘Lack of Ability to Compromise’ If, by appearing on Laura Ingraham’s show on Monday night, John F. Kelly was trying to do damage control after the indictments of Trump associates earlier in the day, it did not work.Instead, Mr. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, resurrected the debate over Confederate monuments — previously fueled by his boss, President Trump, over the summer — and the Confederacy itself. He called Robert E. Lee “an honorable man who gave up his country to fight for his state,” said that “men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand,” and argued that “the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War.”Christina Wilkie, a reporter for CNBC, used Twitter to live-blog Monday’s interview, on the Fox News program “The Ingraham Angle.” Her tweet quoting Mr. Kelly’s “lack of an ability to compromise” statement spread quickly.The reaction was swift and unforgiving, with many commenters ridiculing Mr. Kelly for suggesting that slavery was an issue on which a compromise could or should have been reached.Within less than two hours, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s daughter Bernice King had weighed in on Mr. Kelly’s description of Robert E. Lee as “honorable,” calling his comments “irresponsible” and “dangerous” and criticizing him for making “fighting to maintain slavery sound courageous.”On Tuesday, the White House did not back down. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, said there was “pretty strong consensus” among people from “the left, the right, the North and the South” that a failure to compromise contributed to the war.That consensus, she said, holds that “if some of the individuals engaged had been willing to come to some compromises on different things then it might not have occurred.”But the response on social media and from Democratic lawmakers suggested anything but consensus.Other people referred disapprovingly to Mr. Kelly’s reputation as a voice of reason and discipline within the Trump administration: the “adult in the room”; the person keeping, or at least trying to keep, Mr. Trump under control.And many pointed out that, in fact, many attempts were made to avert the Civil War through compromise — that is, by agreeing to allow slavery in some places.The Missouri Compromise, in 1820, admitted Missouri to the union as a slave state; in exchange, it admitted Maine as a free state and barred slavery in most parts of the Louisiana Purchase territory north of a specified latitude. The Compromise of 1850 eliminated the slave trade from Washington, D.C., but also required citizens of free states to aid in the capture of fugitive slaves. The Kansas-Nebraska Act, which replaced the Missouri Compromise in 1854, let citizens of Kansas and Nebraska decide whether to allow slavery.And, of course, there was the compromise that aided the very passage of the Constitution: the Three-Fifths Compromise, which counted slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purposes of congressional districting.“If John Kelly isn’t a complete idiot,” John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a public policy research organization, tweeted late Monday, “he’s at least 3/5ths of the way there.”In a lengthy series of tweets, the author Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote that the “notion that Civil War resulted from a lack of compromise is belied by all the compromises made on enslavement from America’s founding.”
Review: Greta Gerwig’s ‘Lady Bird’ Is Big-Screen Perfection Christine McPherson, who prefers to be called Lady Bird — it’s her given name, she insists, in the sense that “it’s given to me, by me” — is a senior at a Catholic girls’ high school. Sister Sarah Joan (Lois Smith), the principal, has read Lady Bird’s college application essay. “It’s clear how much you love Sacramento,” Sister Sarah remarks. This comes as a surprise, both to Lady Bird and the viewer, who is by now aware of Lady Bird’s frustration with her hometown.“I guess I pay attention,” she says, not wanting to be contrary.“Don’t you think they’re the same thing?” the wise sister asks.The idea that attention is a form of love (and vice versa) is a beautiful insight, and in many ways it’s the key to “Lady Bird,” Greta Gerwig’s beautiful, insightful new film, the first for which she is solely credited as writer and director. Ms. Gerwig, a Sacramento native and member of her heroine’s generation — the movie takes place mostly during the 2002-3 academic year — knows her characters and their world very well. Her affection envelopes them like a secular form of grace: not uncritically, but unconditionally. And if you pay the right kind of attention to “Lady Bird” — absorbing its riffs and digressions as well as its melodies, its choral passages along with its solos and duets — you will almost certainly love it. It’s hard not to.Lady Bird herself may be a bit more of a challenge. Played with daunting, dauntless precision by Saoirse Ronan (already, at 23, one of the most formidable actors in movies today), Lady Bird can give herself and everyone around her a hard time. Not because she is especially reckless or troubled — “Lady Bird” is the farthest thing from a melodrama of youth gone wild — but because she insists on asserting her own individuality, even when she’s not quite sure what that means.She tackles the practical and spiritual project of becoming who she is with the mixture of self-assurance and insecurity common to adolescents of a certain sensitive kind. She is idealistic and hypocritical; self-centered and generous; a rebel and a conformist; an enthusiast and a skeptic. A typical American teenager, but also — and therefore — a unique bundle of contradictory and confusing impulses.“I want you to be the very best version of yourself,” says her judgmental, habitually disappointed mother, Marion (Laurie Metcalf).“But what if this is the best version?” Lady Bird responds. It’s a sharp, sardonic line (one of many) and also an anguished existential question.Christine (to use the name Marion gave her) wants to satisfy her mother, which is a difficult task because the standards seem impossibly high and subject to change without notice. She also wants to be true to her own desires and convictions, which is difficult for other reasons.While “Lady Bird” honors the gravity of Christine’s struggle, it hardly neglects the everyday absurdity of her plight. The very first scene begins in tears. Mother and daughter, listening to an audiobook of “The Grapes of Wrath” while driving home from a college tour, cry over the novel’s moving final sentences. Their shared moment of literary catharsis quickly devolves into an argument, which is punctuated by a startling and hilarious jolt of physical comedy (one of many).In tone and structure, after all, this is a teenage comedy. It finds humor in the eternally renewable cycle of senior year: homecoming and prom; math tests and school plays; the agonizing stages of the “admissions process.” Along the way, Christine undergoes other, extracurricular rites of passage. She falls in love for the first time and has sex for the first time. She trades in her loyal, longtime best friend (Beanie Feldstein) for a richer, more popular girl (Odeya Rush). She fights with her mother and her older brother, Miguel (Jordan Rodrigues), and leans on her father, Larry (Tracy Letts), an affable fellow with troubles of his own.You might think you’ve seen this all before. You probably have, but never quite like this. What Ms. Gerwig has done — and it’s by no means a small accomplishment — is to infuse one of the most convention-bound, rose-colored genres in American cinema with freshness and surprise. The characters can look like familiar figures: the sad dad and the disapproving mom; the sullen brother and his goth girlfriend (Marielle Scott); the mean girls and the cool teachers; the too-perfect boyfriend (Lucas Hedges) and the dirtbag boyfriend (Timothée Chalamet). None of them are caricatures, though, and while everyone is mocked, nobody is treated with cruelty or contempt, at least by Ms. Gerwig. (Lady Bird is not always so kind.)The script is exceptionally well-written, full of wordplay and lively argument. Every line sounds like something a person might actually say, which means that the movie is also exceptionally well acted. It is not too quick to soothe the abrasions of class and family. The McPhersons are hardly poor, but the daily toll of holding onto the ragged middle of the middle class is evident in Larry’s melancholy and Marion’s ill humor. They are a loving family, but their steadfast devotion to one another doesn’t always express itself as kindness. They are real people, honestly portrayed.That might make “Lady Bird” sound drab and dutiful, but it’s the opposite. I wish I could convey to you just how thrilling this movie is. I wish I could quote all of the jokes and recount the best offbeat bits. I’d tell you about the sad priest and the football coach, about the communion wafers and the Sacramento real estate, about the sly, jaunty editing rhythms, the oddly apt music choices and the way Ms. Ronan drops down on the grass in front of her house when she receives an important piece of mail. I’m tempted to catalog the six different ways the ending can make you cry.I’ll settle for one: the bittersweet feeling of having watched someone grow in front of your eyes, into a different and in some ways improved version of herself. In life, that’s a messy, endless process, which is one reason we need movies. Or to put it another way, even though Lady Bird will never be perfect, “Lady Bird” is.
Luke Skywalker Speaks MALIBU, Calif. — It was maybe the longest buildup in movie history.After more than three decades since he was last onscreen, years of anticipation and some two hours into “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” there was Luke Skywalker, the once youthful hero of this science-fiction saga, revealed as a weathered elder. Standing at a cliff with a solemn look on his face, he was about to receive his lightsaber from Rey, the young heroine, when the story ended and the credits rolled. Luke never said a word.If this was a bittersweet moment for fans — an abrupt, tantalizing preface to the next “Star Wars” sequel, “The Last Jedi,” which opens Dec. 15 — imagine how it felt for Mark Hamill.Since 1977, when the original “Star Wars” went supernova and started a multibillion-dollar franchise, Mr. Hamill has been synonymous with Luke Skywalker, the desert-dwelling tenderfoot who destroys the Death Star, becomes a Jedi knight and reconciles with his villainous father, Darth Vader.In 2015, “The Force Awakens” found more substantial screen time for the senior incarnations of Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford). But Luke was withheld for maximum anticipation, a decision that Mr. Hamill came to accept — eventually — as a gift to him and his character.“It is, if you can be objective about it,” he said a few weeks ago, sitting in his home here near the Pacific Ocean.Finding that inner peace took Mr. Hamill several months of frustration and self-pity — not to mention a Lucasfilm-mandated regimen of dieting and exercise, during which he thought to himself: “Why are they training me to turn and remove a hood? I could be the size of Marlon Brando in ‘Apocalypse Now,’ who’s going to know?”You would understand if Mr. Hamill, now 66, had a conflicted relationship with “Star Wars,” which put him on a pop-cultural pedestal. The series defined and dominated his career, even as he took on other film, television and theater roles; the franchise went into periods of hibernation, then came roaring back and restored him to relevance when he least expected it.But Mr. Hamill isn’t bitter or jaded, and he isn’t Luke, though he has retained some of that character’s incorruptibility. He’s gone from a new hope to an old hand, with a lined, expressive face and a gray beard, beneath which lurks a mischievous sense of humor, a yearning to perform and a joy in sharing “Star Wars” war stories.At heart, he is as much of an unapologetic geek as any of his admirers, as astonished by the circumstances that brought “Star Wars” into his life as he is grateful that he gets to return to its galaxy of long ago and far, far away.“I’m such a fraud,” he said with a theatrical air. “But I’m enjoying all the residual attention that the movie’s getting. I should be, by all rights, puttering in my garden with a metal detector, telling kids to get off my lawn. What’s not to love?”On this October afternoon, he was at home with his wife, Marilou, and their daughter, Chelsea; the couple also has two sons, Nathan and Griffin. The spacious dwelling is hardly a shrine to “Star Wars” — it’s mostly decorated with artwork of cherubs and the Beatles, Mr. Hamill’s own cultural obsession, though you might spot a photo of the 2-year-old Nathan frolicking with Yoda on the set of “Return of the Jedi.”Mr. Hamill is not unduly nostalgic, but he conducts himself with an impish refusal to grow up. In conversation, he will sometimes stretch on the floor in yoga poses; he’ll slip into the exaggerated voices of famous colleagues — the adenoidal clip of the “Star Wars” creator George Lucas or the disaffected monotone of Mr. Ford.In many ways, he is still the boy who was fascinated with cartoon voice actors, musical theater, stage magicians and ventriloquists, and whose favorite film was “King Kong.”Proudly recalling a fight scene from “Return of the Jedi,” Mr. Hamill said, “For me, sitting in the rancor’s hand, I was going all Fay Wray — it’s like a major accomplishment to me. But it was always that way. I’d say ‘Hey, you guys, my face is on the back of a box of C-3PO’s cereal!’”The son of a Navy officer, Mr. Hamill was the middle child of seven siblings. He had an itinerant upbringing, living in California, Virginia and Japan, attending nine schools in 12 years and perpetually feeling like the new kid.When he arrived in Los Angeles in 1969, Mr. Hamill was interested in acting, but really wanted to be involved in show business however he could. “If I didn’t get a part, no problem,” he said. “Then where do I go? I sell tickets. I make props. I make posters. I don’t have to be in the show – I want to be near the show.”He landed early roles on “General Hospital” and “The Partridge Family.” And then, of course, came “Star Wars”: a strange screenplay, still in flux when he read it, with sentient robots, laser swords and a supernatural spirituality bound up in a fable about good and evil.Mr. Lucas said he chose Mr. Hamill from a pool of young actors because he brought a measure of humanity to a film full of space vehicles and special effects. “I needed a protagonist who was comfortable treating these things both casually and seriously in order to give that world an air of authenticity,” Mr. Lucas said. He added that Mr. Hamill “brought a boyish enthusiasm and exuberance that really defined the character,” and that “made Luke accessible and relatable to people in the first ‘Star Wars’” and its sequels.Mr. Hamill committed fully to the material, but was unsure it would find a wider audience. “I thought, even if this thing doesn’t slay at the box office, it’s got midnight cult movie written all over it,” he said. “Move over, ‘Rocky Horror,’ ‘Star Wars’ is here!”Instead, “Star Wars” became an international phenomenon, tying Mr. Hamill to his character and to Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford — even now, he sometimes accidentally calls them “Harry and Carrison” — as they promoted the movie together.When the critic John Simon wrote in New York magazine that Mr. Ford had performed “adequately,” Mr. Hamill “uninspiredly” and Ms. Fisher “wretchedly,” Mr. Hamill said, “We had T-shirts made: ‘adequate, uninspired and wretched.’ I said, ‘Harrison, adequate’s practically a rave compared to what we got.’”Mr. Ford said that during this time, “the three of us were like a very small tribe in the wilderness. We really were figuring this out as we went along.” Mr. Hamill struck him as “a very bright, sincere young actor,” who Mr. Ford said “seemed probably the most clear on what he was doing.”Mr. Hamill, who receives a percentage of the “Star Wars” royalties, did not go onto a mainstream career, but he is hardly rueful now. Of his cohort, Mr. Hamill said Mr. Ford was the one meant for matinee idol status: “He’s a brilliant actor — that’s a given,” he said. “He’s also a leading man. When I tested for this thing, I assumed he was the protagonist and I was his annoying sidekick.” Mr. Hamill believed he’d find his destiny on a different path — one that was less glamorous, but that fully embraced his affection for the esoteric, the offbeat and the weird.After two blockbuster sequels, “The Empire Strikes Back” in 1980 and “Return of the Jedi” in 1983, Mr. Hamill believed the “Star Wars” story was complete. With newfound visibility, he decided to pursue a lifelong dream of performing on Broadway, where he had played John Merrick in “The Elephant Man.” “I wasn’t getting character parts in movies and television,” he explained. “Unless you’re Meryl Streep, they don’t let you do accents.”He starred in the Broadway production of “Amadeus” while “Return of the Jedi” was still in theaters. But his 1985 musical “Harrigan ’n Hart,” about a pair of 19th-century variety-theater stars, was a notorious dud, running less than a week of regular performances.Over the next 30 years, Mr. Hamill was cast in cult films and TV shows, often poking fun at his inability to shed his “Star Wars” legacy. He played an interstellar fighter pilot in the Wing Commander video games, and on “The Simpsons,” he portrayed himself playing Nathan Detroit as Luke Skywalker in a mediocre dinner-theater production of “Guys and Dolls.” Perhaps his best-known work from this era was providing the voice of the malevolent Joker in several animated Batman TV shows, movies and video games.He was always comfortable being part of the “Star Wars” subculture, gladly attending conventions and engaging with the people he calls U.P.F.s (for “ultra-passionate fans”).“It’s clearly not for everyone — I get that,” Mr. Hamill said. “But the passion of it all is just astonishing. The way it’s become part of the fabric of their lives — ‘I met my wife at this movie, we named our child Leia’ — it’s moving.”He was not involved in the much-maligned “Star Wars” prequels from 1999 to 2005. And when Mr. Lucas invited him and Ms. Fisher to a lunch in 2012, to tell them he was giving control of Lucasfilm to Kathleen Kennedy and that a new “Star Wars” trilogy was being planned, Mr. Hamill had no expectation of being asked to participate. “We figured we had the middle three,” he said. “It was over.”When Mr. Lucas said their characters would be included in these new films if they wanted to play them, Mr. Hamill said, “I was completely stunned. Carrie, not a minute went by — she slapped the table and goes, ‘I’m in!’ I said, ‘Carrie, poker face!’”Mr. Hamill needed more time to think. “I was just really scared,” he said. “I thought, why mess with it? The idea of catching lightning in a bottle twice was ridiculously remote.”He also feared that audiences would reject him and his veteran co-stars, all these years after their “Star Wars” heyday. “No one wants to see the 50-, 60-, 70-year-old versions of us, running around, bumping heads on the Death Star,” he said. “It’s sad.”Mr. Hamill thought he would have some cover to refuse “The Force Awakens,” expecting that Mr. Ford would not return.“He’s too old and too rich and too cranky,” Mr. Hamill said. “He’s not going to do this.” But when Mr. Ford said yes, Mr. Hamill realized he had to agree, too: “Can you imagine if I was the only one to say no? I’d be the most hated man in nerd-dom.”Soon after accepting, Mr. Hamill got to bask in the adulation of “Star Wars” fans eager to see him on new adventures with the young novices Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega). He trained to get into shape and met with Lucasfilm artists. But deeper behind the scenes, J.J. Abrams, the director of “The Force Awakens,” and his co-writer, Lawrence Kasdan, a writer of “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi,” were realizing their ever-expanding script could not accommodate Luke’s story line. (The screenplay was credited to Mr. Abrams, Mr. Kasdan and Michael Arndt.)“The idea of it was so enormous,” Mr. Abrams said. “It became clear that there was no way that that movie could also include those chapters. That had to be the next movie.”Eventually Mr. Abrams had to tell Mr. Hamill that Luke would not be a significant character in “The Force Awakens.” “I let him know before he read the script that his role was minimal,” Mr. Abrams said. “I don’t think he knew just how minimal until he read it.”In their next conversation, Mr. Abrams acknowledged, Mr. Hamill was “not particularly happy with how little he was in it.”Mr. Hamill does not deny his initial disappointment, though he said he was mostly afraid that Luke’s big reveal at the end would fall flat. “If it smacks the audience as a cheat or a gimmick, if there’s a big groan in the house, the egg’s on my face, not J.J.’s,” he said.Amid lingering feelings of petulance, Mr. Hamill traveled to London in 2014 for a table read — he jokingly calls it a “table listen” — of the “Force Awakens” script. He had no dialogue, so Mr. Abrams instead asked him to read the narration. (“I think he wanted to break me, like you break a racehorse,” Mr. Hamill said.) Still, he was excited to meet Ms. Ridley and Mr. Boyega, and to reunite with Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford.Mr. Ford, who had not seen Mr. Hamill in many years and shared no scenes with him in “The Force Awakens,” lamented that they had worked together on the early “Star Wars” movies far less than viewers realize.“The number of onscreen days that I spent with Mark were very, very few,” he said. “I knew Chewbacca better.”Yet as soon as he spotted Mr. Hamill there, Mr. Ford said, “aside from the obvious passage of time, which had happened to both of us, he was very much the same guy, albeit bearded.”“He’s very centered in his own experience and his own life,” Mr. Ford said. “He’s not a grandstander. He’s a quiet, sincere, workmanlike presence, and that’s what we’re there for.”Mr. Hamill has come to appreciate his extended cameo in “The Force Awakens” — “when they talk about you that much in a movie before you even show up, that’s fabulous,” he said.But now he and the “The Last Jedi” creators understand how much is riding on them with this film.“I told him, everyone is going to be leaning forward for your first words in this,” said Rian Johnson, the “Last Jedi” writer and director. “Obviously, Mark came into this one with higher expectations for what we do with the character.”Mr. Johnson said “The Last Jedi” also treated Mr. Hamill as an actor who has lived a whole life since he first played Luke. “In the same way that as a young man, he embodied the characteristics we all connected with — the youthfulness and innocence — he now embodies a person full of soul and experience,” Mr. Johnson said.While Mr. Hamill tries not to dispute the “Star Wars” filmmakers on big plot points — he’s still not sure whether Mr. Lucas always intended for Luke and Leia to be brother and sister — he found himself full of strong opinions about how the character he has been associated with for 40 years should be presented in “The Last Jedi.”“That’s the hard part,” Mr. Hamill said. “You don’t want to admit how possessive you’ve become. There are times where you go, ‘Really? That’s what they think of Luke? I’m not only in disagreement – I’m insulted.’ But that’s the process and you thrash it all out.”The film has become an unexpectedly poignant document since Ms. Fisher died in December. Though their contact was fitful in her final years, Mr. Hamill said that Ms. Fisher was a reliably caustic companion and correspondent — someone who brought a wicked sense of humor to the occasionally onerous media events they attended together and offered him a constant reminder of his obligation to “Star Wars.”Several years ago, when Ms. Fisher noticed in a theater program that Mr. Hamill had referred only elliptically to his “Star Wars” work, he said, “She goes, ‘What’s your problem?’ I said, ‘Well, it’s theater, I want it to be more focused on theater.’ She goes, ‘I am Princess Leia. You’re Luke Skywalker. Get used to it.’”More remorsefully, Mr. Hamill spoke of his frustration that Ms. Fisher would not get to complete this trilogy of films.“She deserved that second act,” he said. “Harrison was more prominent in VII, I’m more prominent in this one, and she was meant to be more prominent in the last one. Her timing was perfect, except in this case.”His “Star Wars” colleagues say that there is something fitting about the fact that the devoted, less heralded Mr. Hamill is the only lead actor from the original films presently involved with the franchise — “He’s the last man standing,” said Mr. Ford, whose character met his demise in “The Force Awakens.”But Mr. Ford was reluctant to speculate what this distinction might mean to Mr. Hamill.“It means what it means to him, and that’s all that matters,” he said. “I’m sure what he represents in the story is something worthy of attainment by those younger characters, and” — his voice took on an uncharacteristically whimsical tone — “that it’s all linked together in some cosmically glorious way that will assure Mark work for years to come.”Mr. Hamill prefers not to scrutinize this too closely either. Pleading self-consciousness, he said he has not watched the original “Star Wars” movies outside of theaters and has seen “The Force Awakens” only twice.“All I notice are flaws,” he explained. “‘Oh, why did I do that?’ ‘Look at my hair.’ ‘What was I thinking?’”During production of “The Force Awakens,” he allowed himself to watch the audition reels of actors who were also considered for Luke Skywalker — Will Seltzer, Robby Benson, William Katt — and was struck by what he saw. “They were all great,” Mr. Hamill said. “They all could have been really good Luke Skywalkers, which really makes me appreciate the arbitrariness.”One film Mr. Hamill goes back to frequently is “A Hard Day’s Night,” Richard Lester’s madcap comedy about the Beatles happily enduring the hardships of celebrity as they are pursued by fans.As a teenager, Mr. Hamill said, “I saw it originally going, ‘Oh, can you imagine it? Girls chasing me down the street! It looks like so much fun.’” But when he viewed it again recently, he saw it in another light. “It’s like a horror movie,” he said. “They’re trapped. They can’t go anywhere.”One scene that stuck in Mr. Hamill’s mind was the “Can’t Buy Me Love” sequence, when the Fab Four are running through a field, clowning around, blissfully free of the gravitational forces awaiting them in the outside world.“It’s the one time they spontaneously feel exuberance and joy,” Mr. Hamill said. “It plays so differently now, when you’re on the other end of it.”
Republicans Push Their Tax Bill, Which is Still Secret WASHINGTON — House Republicans rushed on Tuesday to finalize details of a tax bill that they are set to release on Wednesday, courting support from critical interest groups and swing-vote lawmakers, while keeping frustrated lobbyists largely in the dark.A few key details began to trickle out from what has been a closed-door process of debating and deciding how to fill in the blank spaces in the framework tax plan that President Trump and Republican leaders released in September.The House bill will include a worldwide minimum tax on multinational corporations’ profits, two sources with knowledge of the drafting said, in an effort to prevent companies from shifting money abroad as the United States transitions to a so-called territorial tax system, which would only subject income earned domestically to the American corporate tax rate. The tax would be on all global income, and not on a country-by-country basis, as some companies had feared.Republican leaders also confirmed they will maintain a federal tax deduction for at least some state and local property taxes paid, while eliminating comparable deductions for income and sales taxes.Other issues remained in flux, or unknown outside of a select group of lawmakers and congressional staff. Those include whether the top income tax rate will rise or fall for the wealthiest; the size of an expanded child tax credit ; whether to phase in or sunset some rate cuts and the specifics of how the plan might affect tax-free retirement savings.Mr. Trump invited nearly two dozen leaders of major business groups — including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Petroleum Institute and the American Farm Bureau Federation — to the White House on Tuesday morning to discuss the bill. In the afternoon, Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin was set to meet with Mr. Trump and then with more than a dozen conservative groups on the tax bill, including the Heritage Foundation and Americans for Prosperity.Each of those groups — and in many cases, individual companies — will be watching for how lawmakers change tax breaks large and small in their overhaul of the tax code. Business leaders, in particular, are ready to applaud or attack the bill depending on how those changes affect their bottom lines.”We’re trying to see, and evaluate with a calculator at the end of the day, are the incentives going to be right to help the economy to grow?” said David Stevens, the president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, whose industry has much at stake in the rewrite of the tax code.A Halloween-themed news release from Mr. Ryan’s office on Tuesday suggested that Republicans are prepared for many business groups to oppose the bill when it is released. “The special interest ghouls will do anything to protect all their little tricks and treats,” the release said. “They will haunt the hallways and demonize our plan. They will conjure up new scare tactics and spread wicked tales.”Party leaders are already struggling to kill off some tax breaks they had targeted for elimination. Republicans had proposed wiping out the entire deduction for state and local taxes, which is particularly valuable to high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California. After running into resistance from lawmakers, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady of Texas, said over the weekend that the coming tax bill would include “an itemized property tax deduction to help taxpayers with local tax burdens.”In an interview Tuesday with the radio host Hugh Hewitt, Mr. Brady said the tax bill would not include a deduction for state or local income taxes.“Our lawmakers in those high-tax states really believe their families are being punished the most by property taxes,” Mr. Brady said, adding that those taxes “are not based on your ability to pay — they’re just painful.”Mr. Brady also signaled the deduction for property taxes could be limited. Asked if there would be no cap on that deduction, Mr. Brady responded, “To be determined.”Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York and a member of the Ways and Means Committee, said on Tuesday it was clear that the original plan to fully eliminate the deduction for state and local taxes was “not going to occur.”“I think that shows a demonstration by our leadership and by the powers to be that we recognize that this issue needs to be resolved,” Mr. Reed told reporters. He said that retaining a deduction for property taxes was “gaining traction as we get to the finish line here.”“We have to provide relief to the people that we represent, because this is real policy that they’re suffering under, even though it’s imposed by our governors with their high-tax mentality,” Mr. Reed said. He added, “At the end of the day, I think a property tax deduction on the property taxes that our local taxpayers pay is where we end up.”It did not appear on Tuesday that the compromise was sufficient to win over all the blue-state House Republicans who had raised concerns.Democrats criticized the compromise. “Go figure that high property-tax states like Texas, Chairman Brady’s state, would be better off under the proposal,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and minority leader, said. “Picking winners and losers like this doesn’t solve the problem. The new state and local compromise is still a nearly trillion-dollar tax hike on the middle class to pay for tax giveaways to big corporations and the very wealthy.”Mr. Trump pushed back on Democratic criticism in his meeting with business leaders.“The Democrats will say our tax bill is for the rich, but they know it’s not,” he said. He added: “The Democrats want to raise taxes and really create obstruction, and the Republicans want to lower taxes, and we want to get rid of regulations.”He said that he wants the House to vote on its version of the bill by Thanksgiving so it can still pass the Senate and be reconciled in time to be signed into law by Christmas. Asked by a reporter about phasing in the corporate tax rate reductions, he said that was not his plan.Mr. Trump was joined in the meeting by his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who on Monday stressed to reporters that the administration believes cutting corporate taxes will raise incomes for the middle class.Mr. Mnuchin’s remarks came at the conclusion of a trip to Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to focus on efforts to combat terrorist financing in the region.Despite being far away from Washington, the tax plan was never far from mind. Several foreign officials asked Mr. Mnuchin about the status of the legislation, and the secretary said he was in constant contact with congressional leaders.“I’ve been on the phone multiple times a day, sometimes in the middle of the night,” said Mr. Mnuchin, who has decided against traveling with Mr. Trump on his upcoming Asia trip to focus on taxes. “We’re almost there.”
A Day Before Presenting Their Tax Cut Plan, Republicans Still Wrestle With Key Details House Republicans are just one day away from unveiling their long-awaited tax plan, yet many key details remain in flux.Lawmakers have paved the way for a $1.5 trillion tax cut, but the provisions under discussion would far exceed that cost. Republicans are still struggling with how to make the math work, including how to treat the wealthiest Americans, whether to get rid of some of the most valuable tax deductions and whether to make the income tax cuts temporary.Here are some of the biggest issues and the current state of play.Eliminating the deduction that taxpayers take for state and local tax expenses has emerged as one of the most contentious issues in the tax debate. Doing away with the deduction would save $1.3 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Policy Center, and could be necessary to give any big tax plan a semblance of fiscal responsibility.Many Republicans are happy to do away with the deduction because it tends to benefit wealthy people in Democratic states that have high local taxes. But several Republican lawmakers also represent areas where constituents, including those in the upper-middle class, make heavy use of the deduction.Party leaders are trying to soften the blow, and Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, said in a statement the bill would allow taxpayers to deduct property taxes, but not state and local income taxes. That may not be enough to win over Republicans in states with high taxes, including those in the Senate, who are crucial to the bill’s passage.Lawmakers are still considering changes to the amount of pretax income that workers can set aside in their 401(k) retirement accounts. Currently, workers under 50 can save up to $18,000 a year without having to pay taxes up front. House Republicans are discussing changing the rules so workers are encouraged to put more money into retirement accounts that are taxed upfront, like Roth I.R.A.s, rather than on the back end.This creates both practical and political problems. Lowering the cap on 401(k) contributions would save only a sliver of the $1.5 trillion in lost revenue from the tax cuts that Republicans are pushing. What is more, such plans are widely used by middle-class taxpayers that Republicans say they are trying to help.The tax framework released by the so-called big six Republican tax working group last month — the six lead negotiators from the House, Senate and Trump administration — called for three tax brackets with a top rate of 35 percent, down from 39.6 percent today. The plan kept open the option of creating an additional tax bracket for top earners to ensure the tax code remained progressive. No guidance was given on what that tax rate would be or what income level it would affect.Lawmakers are still debating whether to create an additional bracket for millionaires and whether to keep it at the current top rate of 39.6 percent or slightly changing it.Republican leaders in Congress have been hesitant to raise tax rates on anyone because the party’s brand is largely built around the idea that the economy does best when people have more money to spend. Yet they may have no choice: Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said this week that she would not support a plan that includes a tax cut for millionaires, creating pressure for Republicans to include a higher bracket in order to win passage.Republican lawmakers are selling their plan as a middle-class tax cut, and the bill is expected to create three income tax brackets — 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent — and call for doubling the standard deduction. Yet lawmakers are considering making these changes temporary, so they would expire after 10 years.The conventional wisdom is that a future Congress will vote to continue the cuts and not allow them to expire. But that’s a tricky assumption given their cost, which will only exacerbate a federal deficit already on an upward trajectory. The Treasury Department said the deficit for the fiscal year 2017 grew by $80 billion, to $666 billion. Federal debt, which has already topped $20 trillion, is expected to grow by an additional $10 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Compounding the math problem is that the plan would probably make the corporate tax cuts permanent. Lawmakers argue that a permanent cut, to 20 percent from today’s 35 percent rate, is needed to trigger the economic growth they anticipate, and they say it will ultimately put more money into workers’ pockets.Still, those corporate tax cuts are expected to cost $2 trillion over the next decade and, to help make the budget work, lawmakers are discussing phasing in the corporate tax cut over several years to get to the 20 percent rate. The White House on Monday seemed to suggest that was a nonstarter.The original framework called for repealing the estate tax, which would reduce federal revenues by $239 billion over a decade.Estates are taxed at a rate of 40 percent, but the first $5.49 million of an inheritance is exempt from taxation. Couples can leave their heirs as much as $11 million, none of it taxed, meaning only a few thousand wealthy estates are subject to the tax each year.President Trump has talked about the estate tax as a punishment for farmers and small businesses, but his Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has acknowledged that getting rid of it would “disproportionately” help rich people.That has turned into a key talking point for Democrats, who are already working to kill the bill in the hopes that they can find a way to a bipartisan tax plan.Republicans are now discussing raising the limit, instead of an outright repeal, so that more money can be left to families tax-free. One proposal frequently raised among lobbyists is that Republicans could attempt to double the existing exemptions, instead of eliminating the tax altogether.
Matcha? Manicures? Fenty? It’s the Dawn of a New Century 21 At Next Century, the boutique-minded new shop inside Century 21, Isaac Gindi, a second-generation garmento, and his new hire, Chrissie Miller (native New Yorkers both), were putting the finishing touches on a whole new vision for a metropolitan institution.“Everything that the millennial really likes to dress in, we have it here!” said Mr. Gindi, an owner of Century 21 Stores, the department store whose flame has burned, undimmed, to generations of discount-loving moths. “That Gucci thing with a pair of Levi’s — that’s the way they dress today. It’s mix and match. That’s what we have. Who has that? I’m asking you!”That’s what they have, and have had for some 56 years, since Mr. Gindi’s father and uncle, Sonny and Al Gindi, founded the store in 1961. Not Gucci and Levi’s per se, though maybe on a lucky day, but a rack-bursting mix of anything and everything, provided it is offered at a deep discount.Century 21 offers off-price designer clothes, shoes, accessories and home goods, which is to say, slightly out of season or overstock, in an atmosphere where service may range between warm and war-torn. For those willing to dig for their bargains (and defend them once in hand), it is practically a holy site.But at Next Century, which opens on Thursday, the rougher edges of Century 21 have been sanded away, the better to lure a new generation. Mr. Gindi and Ms. Miller, the former designer of Sophomore, have buffed the space and its offerings to an Instagram-ready gleam. (The neon-rimmed mirror is particularly good for selfies, Mr. Gindi said.) New to the store are young or under-the-radar labels like Adam Selman, Olympia Le-Tan, Trademark and Maison Mayle, sourced by Ms. Miller. Upstairs, Proenza Schouler hangs not far from a rack of Fenty Puma by Rihanna.There are décor and impulse-buy touches borrowed from the 2017 playbook: vases of leafy green fronds and jars of individually wrapped Korean face masks, the sort of thing that might confuse the bubbes and babushkas of yore, who once stripped down to their underpinnings in the big store’s old communal dressing rooms, or even before.“They used to undress on the selling floor!” Mr. Gindi said. “I’ve broken up many fights between customers.”At Next Century, the vibe is more supportive: a side-by-side manicure at the second-floor nail art bar? A matcha latte at the second-floor Chalait coffee and tea bar? A flip through a vintage issue of Andy Warhol’s Interview in the lounge?Next Century and Century 21 will be connected but disparate. Next Century has its own entrance, at 21 Dey Street, but connects to the main store through a pair of mirrored doors. The prices, as befit Century 21, are far lower than in-season designer goods. Some finds are limited to a single piece, the kind pursued in dreams: an Alaïa top ($529.99, down from $1,765); a Céline blouse ($429.99, down from $1,450); or a Row sweater ($499.99, down from $1,690).Others are carried in a full run of sizes, and some, like the Telfar collection by Telfar Clemens, were made specifically for the store. Mr. Clemens’s creative director, Babak Radboy, even created a logo for the capsule, a swooping “Telfar” over the looping Century 21, a design Mr. Radboy had been fiddling with long before Century 21 even came to call. (“I don’t know if he was playing around with this in a full moon, or what,” Mr. Clemens said.) The two have been Century 21 shoppers for years; Mr. Clemens decided to go to Pace University, he said, in part because of its proximity to the store.Brian Procell, the New York vintage dealer and owner of Procell Vintage, has his own Century 21 stories, too — “as all New Yorkers do,” he said. Ms. Miller invited him to bring in a collection of vintage designer pieces from the 1990s and early 2000s to sell on the ground floor.“We jumped at it,” Mr. Procell said, flipping through racks of Junior Gaultier, Polo Ralph Lauren, Helmut Lang, Stephen Sprouse for Target and Christian Dior (the Galliano era). He waxed mystical: “I feel like a lot of the designer pieces we have here were at some point living here.”Mr. Gindi hopes to open similar spaces in other Century 21 stores; there are now 13, between the New York metro area, Philadelphia and Florida.“It’s tough right now,” Ms. Miller said. “It’s a good time for this. Everyone wants a deal, everyone wants a discount. Instead of fast fashion you can come here and get similar prices.”Mr. Gindi chimed in: “In the early days it was hard. Off-price, it was like you were a leper. Today everybody sells to us, everybody loves us, everybody wants to be here.”
Paul Manafort’s Shopping Sprees Hit Home Of all the damning details in the Justice Department indictment accusing Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, and Rick Gates, a campaign adviser, of money laundering and tax fraud, the one that seems to have caught the imagination of many is the approximately $1.3 million Mr. Manafort spent during two shopping sprees in New York and Beverly Hills.The indictment does not specify where he spent the money — the establishments are identified only as “Vendor E: Men’s Clothing Store in New York” and “Vendor H: Clothing Store in Beverly Hills, California” — nor what he bought, though The New York Times reported in September that during a raid of Mr. Manafort’s home over the summer, F.B.I. officers took many photographs of his “expensive suits.”And though the shopping entry in the indictment is merely one expense among many, after property, improvements to properties and antiques, it is the largest. It is also the most broadly accessible.Which may be why it has got everyone in a tizzy.“Manafort’s clothing tab: $1.3 million” read the Politico headline. “Fancy Suits at Center of Ex-Trump Campaign Chief Charges,” The Associated Press cried.Clothes may maketh the man. But they can also bringeth him down.Indeed, at least when it comes to politics, fancy clothes or even just an unseemly focus on clothes have been a stand-in for (at best) bad character and (at worst) corruption for years.In 2014, Bob McDonnell, the former governor of Virginia, and his wife, Maureen, were accused of doing favors for Jonnie R. Williams Sr., the former chief executive of Star Scientifica, in exchange for gifts and loans. Among the exhibits in the case: a Louis Vuitton handbag, an Oscar de la Renta dress, an Armani jacket and Rebecca Minkoff shoes. (Their conviction was later overturned.)In 2011, it was revealed that Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, had a $500,000 line of credit at Tiffany & Co. that did not play well when he was preaching fiscal conservatism.Sarah Palin came under fire in 2008 when it was revealed that the Republican National Committee spent $150,000 on clothes for her and her family after she was chosen as the Republican vice-presidential candidate, belying her “hockey Mom” image.And then, of course, there was Imelda Marcos and her shoes. Which is the issue: Such consumption patterns are more associated with a plutocracy (and those who identify with it) than with a democracy.In that context, to spend enormous sums on appearance is not just indicative of a skewed value system, it’s morally reprehensible. It runs against a puritan streak that goes deep in American mythology. It’s the worst kind of gross excess and self-indulgence. It represents a focus on self to the detriment of the welfare of others, as well as some sort of embarrassing display of emotional neediness.Because here’s the other thing: In the indictment, Mr. Manafort is listed as having spent $849,215 at the New York store and $520,440 in California, of which $128,280 was paid in one go in 2010. It’s really difficult to spend that much money on men’s wear. What was in his shopping cart?Roger J. Stone Jr., a former Trump campaign consultant with his own style blog, told C-Span in 2016 that Mr. Manafort favored “custom Italian suits.” As a result, speculation has centered on brands such as Brioni and Kiton, favorites of James Bond as well as captains of industry, and where a made-to-measure suit can cost from $7,000 to more than $10,000.But according to The A.P., Mr. Manafort’s New York tailor of choice was Eugene Venanzi, a store (now closed) off Fifth Avenue where suits cost $7,500. The A.P. also reported that Mr. Manafort’s Rodeo Drive emporium of choice was House of Bijan, a.k.a. “the most expensive store in the world,” where ties run $1,000 apiece.But do the math. Even if Mr. Manafort bought 30 ties, that’s only $30,000. Add 50 suits, even at Kiton prices, and you are at just over half a million.Say — for the sake of argument and spending money — you threw in some Berluti crocodile loafers ($3,380), a Rolex Daytona (there was some speculation on a watch blog that Mr. Manafort had one; prices can be in the $25,000 range), and an Hermès briefcase ($8,850). You still wouldn’t come close to the final tally.It’s hard to make it all add up. Not only literally, but also because after all that, Mr. Manafort did not even look particularly elegant, as numerous commentators on social media have been quick to point out. Which makes it all seem even more disgracefully wasteful. Whatever he thought he was buying, it clearly wasn’t worth it. In any sense of the words.
Kahlil Joseph’s New Film Is Steeped in Harlem’s History. And His Own. It was Kahlil Joseph’s brother who made him an artist. Or at least that’s one way to describe how Mr. Joseph, a successful director who has worked with Kendrick Lamar and Beyoncé, came to premiere his film “Fly Paper” at the New Museum this fall.An impressionistic collage of Harlem’s past and present, “Fly Paper” is being shown continuously in a new ground-floor gallery space at the museum as part of the exhibition, “Kahlil Joseph: Shadow Play.”The film’s title evokes one of Mr. Joseph’s critical influences: the photographer Roy DeCarava, renowned for his chiaroscuro images of Harlem life and culture. Mr. DeCarava, who died in 2009, collected some of his photographs in a best-selling book, “The Sweet Flypaper of Life” (1955), with text by Langston Hughes.This New Museum show is Mr. Joseph’s first solo exhibition in New York. That would be a milestone for any artist but it may be especially significant because Mr. Joseph first showed his work in a gallery a mere three years ago.That was at the urging of his brother, Noah Davis, a contemporary artist who founded an influential exhibition space in Los Angeles called the Underground Museum. Mr. Joseph was a successful filmmaker at the time, directing music videos for artists like Flying Lotus, and was later nominated for an Emmy as one of the directors of Beyoncé’s visual album “Lemonade.”But in 2014, Mr. Joseph had just completed a 14-minute film that he couldn’t release. It was based on work he’d done for Mr. Lamar, after the release of his album “Good Kid, M.A.A.D City.” Blending home video from Mr. Lamar’s family with original footage filmed in Compton, Calif., Mr. Joseph had made something new. But it was not a traditional music video, and Mr. Lamar was not interested in putting it out, Mr. Joseph, 36, recalled in a recent interview.That’s when Mr. Joseph’s brother advised him to turn it into an installation for the Underground Museum. Projected on two screens arranged in a V shape, the film, “m.A.A.d,” was a striking success, drawing a host of new visitors to the space. “All of a sudden, I’m a fine artist,” Mr. Joseph said. “All thanks to my brother.”Among the transfixed viewers was Helen Molesworth, the chief curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. “I literally drove back to the museum and put it on the schedule,” she said.The film’s triumphant run at the Museum of Contemporary Art was followed by more work, including “Lemonade” and “Music Is My Mistress,” a project for the fashion house Kenzo.Then, last year, came the invitation from the New Museum: Could Mr. Joseph create a new film, a sort of New York-based companion piece to “m.A.A.d.”?For the first time in his career, Mr. Joseph faced a blank slate. There was no song, no album, no core material to draw on. But he quickly found that “it’s impossible not to think about all your heroes and references when you write,” he said.In addition to Mr. DeCarava, the photographer, Mr. Joseph drew on the work of Chris Marker, whose film “Sans Soleil” offers an extended meditation on memory and time. With “Fly Paper,” Mr. Joseph pays homage to a host of literary and cultural figures, splicing and mixing in references among its scenes of fictional characters. Some figures skate away, while others recur.The film builds in layers, with vérité footage from the street interspersed with elegant, vividly staged scenes. A woman places a handbag on a bed; an elegant gentleman (Ben Vereen) climbs a set of stairs, then reclines, fully dressed, in a bathtub. He visits an art gallery. He dances in an empty room and with the Brooklyn-born flex dancer Storyboard P. The soundtrack leaps, too. Music collides with the sounds of the city: drums, bass, an ambulance, a train.“I wanted people to feel like they saw a Harlem that they can’t see,” Mr. Joseph said. “You can take a tour bus around Harlem and see the exterior.”His hunt for the heart of the neighborhood also shows the influence of Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts, author of the 2011 book “Harlem Is Nowhere” (its title is from a 1948 essay by Ralph Ellison). The neighborhood’s role as a capital of American culture, and exuberant celebration of African-American life is a voice in his work, which includes a passage read from Ms. Rhodes-Pitts’s book.But some of the ghosts are his own. A middle-aged man in an overcoat gets into a cab. He’s on a gurney, proceeding down a hospital hall. He’s in a chair, head shaved, a surgical scar circling one side of his skull, watching ESPN.That would be Mr. Joseph’s father, the sports and entertainment attorney Keven Davis, who lived in Harlem until his death in 2011 at 53. That shock still reverberates for Mr. Joseph. “I remember having no concept that my parents could ever pass away,” he said. “They seemed like these eternal experiences.”The next shock came in 2015, when Noah, his brother, died at 32. “You think you have a lot of time with people, when you’re young,” Mr. Joseph said. “They’re going to live until they’re at least 70. Right?”It was a struggle to edit “Fly Paper,” because of its deeply personal nature, and only late in the process did Mr. Joseph decide to include footage of his family. Searching through video he had shot in 2011 during his father’s last months, he said, “led to a wormhole, all this stuff that I totally forgot I shot, because I was in such automatic mode.”Again, he was inspired by Mr. DeCarava’s work, noting how the photographer included portraits of his wife and daughters in his 1996 MoMA retrospective, alongside his depictions of jazz greats like Billie Holiday and Miles Davis.“He was able to not compartmentalize,” Mr. Joseph said. “That’s why I started to include my family. That’s my big reference to Roy. That was his big genius.”The loss of his father and brother also contributed to the erosion of Mr. Joseph’s sense of time, he said — a huge preoccupation for a filmmaker. “Our understanding of time as linear is completely false,” he said. In the film, it’s rarely clear whether everything is happening in the same period, across generations, or in a kind of eternal loop.Visitors at the New Museum show wander in, not knowing quite what to expect. But that kind of serendipity is fine with Mr. Joseph, who compared it to his youthful experience of flipping TV channels, only to happen across a movie in progress. “The likelihood that I would finish the film was probably increased by coming in somewhere in the middle, not knowing where I am,” he said.A sense of dislocation defines the film, which slips from one visual format to another — from 35-millimeter color film to coruscating black-and-white to bleary hand-held video — in a way that recalls the rapidly shifting frames of a dream.In the coda, just after the final shot of Mr. Joseph’s father, there is a sequence of video clips from the 1990s, highlights from the career of the former Detroit Lions star running back Barry Sanders, who abruptly retired before the 1999 season. Mr. Joseph warmly recalled that during his father’s final months they would bond over sports, and Mr. Sanders, a particular favorite.“I’ve always been drawn to the ballet-like nature of his specific play,” Mr. Joseph said. He also praised the athlete’s decision to step away from the sport at the peak of his powers. “It was like a Zen samurai principle thing, right?”In the clips, which last a minute or so, the football star streaks across the field, again and again, a flash of joy that sharply contrasts with the painful hospital scenes. It may seem like a jarring shift in mood, but it is in keeping with the film’s essayistic form.“I really love filmmaking, to be honest,” Mr. Joseph said. “More than plot.”
De Blasio Finds Biggest Win in Pre-K, but Also Lasting Consequences During high-pressure meetings to plan the expansion of prekindergarten during his first months in City Hall, Mayor Bill de Blasio would invoke the D-Day invasion of Normandy: There it is on the horizon, he would say, we are approaching the beach, we need a full-on assault. He spoke of it so often that a staffer gave him a picture of the landing, which he kept on the mantelpiece in his office.Making free, full-day prekindergarten available to all 4-year-olds was the most visible and  ambitious promise that Mr. de Blasio made when he campaigned for mayor, so making good on that pledge when he came into office in 2014 was crucial. And he delivered. Full-day prekindergarten enrollment grew to 53,000 in September 2014, from 19,000 a year earlier. It reached 68,000 the next year. Parents were generally pleased and even his critics were impressed.Now as Mr. de Blasio seeks a second term in an election on Nov. 7, the success of universal prekindergarten stands out as the most salient achievement of his mayoralty. It showed that Mr. de Blasio could meet an ambitious goal intended to address the inequality between rich and poor New Yorkers, but one that also helped the middle class. And it showed that a liberal mayor — the first Democrat to occupy City Hall in two decades — could get things done.“It was the proving ground of the capacity to actually do big things,” the first deputy mayor, Anthony Shorris, said, citing other large-scale programs, like those for affordable housing, a city ID card and neighborhood policing.But the prekindergarten push also pointed to some of the weaknesses and blind spots that would become constants during Mr. de Blasio’s four years in City Hall.The dispute over how to pay for prekindergarten expansion marked the start of his toxic feud with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. It called attention to the mayor’s occasional displays of self-righteousness mixed with political naïveté, especially when he saw himself as the protagonist of a lofty mission.It presaged how the Republican-controlled State Senate would become an obstacle to the mayor’s agenda — a situation he made worse when he tried to swing the Senate to Democratic control. That effort, in turn, led to some of the state and federal investigations into fund-raising and pay-to-play that would later threaten to derail his administration.The inquiries also focused on the Campaign for One New York, a nonprofit organization created by the mayor to support his prekindergarten push; the nonprofit was ultimately shut down amid ethics questions.But to his allies, Mr. de Blasio’s ability to deliver on his promise has outweighed any complications.“For so long there’s been this inequity of, if you could afford to send your children to pre-K they got a leg up,” said the Queens borough president, Melinda Katz. “By the time they got into kindergarten, they were reading and writing, they could do basic math. That was such a crux of the inequity of the system.”The creation of universal prekindergarten, she said, “defines him, and it’s going to have historical significance for our future generations.”Even before his first day at City Hall, Mr. de Blasio and his aides were setting in motion the planned expansion of prekindergarten. One of the biggest challenges was finding enough space for hundreds of new prekindergarten classrooms.“We were totally wrong in our assumptions about space, and it was one of those real shocks to the system when we got in the door in the beginning of 2014 on a very, very tight time frame and had to stare down the barrel of that space reality,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference this month.To find, refurbish and secure approvals for classroom space meant coordinating multiple city agencies, including, in various combinations, the Education Department, the Fire Department, the departments of health; buildings; design and construction; housing preservation and development; citywide administrative services, and the School Construction Authority.Laura Santucci, who was Mr. de Blasio’s chief of staff during the first year, said that the multipronged effort inspired the mayor’s frequent comparisons to D-Day, in which he likened the city’s effort to an invasion by land, sea and air. When Ms. Santucci gave Mr. de Blasio the printout of a D-Day photograph, he gave her a high five, she recalled.But before he could begin to outfit classrooms, Mr. de Blasio needed money to pay for the initiative. His proposal, repeated often on the campaign trail, was to use a new dedicated tax on New Yorkers earning more than $500,000 — a maneuver that required Albany’s approval.But Mr. Cuomo was running for re-election in 2014, and showed no enthusiasm for creating a new tax. Shortly after the mayor’s inauguration, the governor embraced his call for prekindergarten, but not the new tax; Mr. Cuomo promised to include money for it in the state budget.Mr. de Blasio slapped the offer down.“The people in the city have given me a mission,” Mr. de Blasio said then. The tax on the wealthy, he said, “was the No. 1 proposal I put forward in an election that I won with 73 percent of the vote.” He added: “I think the jury is in.”In the midst of all that, Mr. de Blasio, started a fight with the charter school movement, diverting a construction fund for charter schools to prekindergarten, and canceling an agreement to give space to three charter schools in public school buildings.The charter schools staged protests against Mr. de Blasio and ran ads, and Mr. Cuomo and State Senate Republicans rushed to their defense. When the mayor went to Albany that March to press for his dedicated tax, the governor held a competing rally that same day just blocks away, on behalf of charter schools — beginning a pattern of one-upsmanship that has continued.Ultimately, the state made a five-year commitment to finance prekindergarten in New York City — without Mr. de Blasio’s tax — but it also passed legislation strengthening the hand of charter schools.In an interview this week, Mr. Cuomo employed a phrase of his father’s, Mario M. Cuomo, to characterize the mayor’s push for a tax on the rich as aspirational, rather than realistic.“The way we campaign is in poetry, aspirational generalizations,” Mr. Cuomo said. “We govern in prose, which is in compromise and programs. The millionaires tax is a great political theme; it’s a great proposal politically. It is governmentally, currently, an impossibility.”Mr. Cuomo said that political reality extends to the present-day battle over how to finance transit system improvements, with the mayor again calling for a tax on high-earners.“We know that’s not a real proposal,” Mr. Cuomo said. “At one point, government has to function.”There were more hiccups at the start of the school year in September 2014. By Mr. de Blasio’s own telling, “It was by the skin of our teeth” that his team found enough space to open enough prekindergarten classes.“It was absolutely a race to the finish line,” he said.Other challenges included the last-minute cancellation or postponement of 45 programs that set off a scramble to relocate children signed up for those schools. But in general, the initiative won praise.As he runs for re-election, Mr. de Blasio repeatedly points to the success of prekindergarten, and it is the model for one of the few new initiatives he has proposed for a second term — the extension of free early childhood education to include all 3-year-olds, which he calls 3-K.“We know pre-K worked,” Mr. de Blasio said at the recent news conference. “A lot of folks said it couldn’t be done, it couldn’t be done that quickly, it couldn’t reach every child. Guess what? It all happened.” He added, “3-K is the next wave.”As with the first prekindergarten project, Mr. de Blasio does not have the money to pay for this expansion and will need to appeal to the state and federal government for financing. But unlike the mad dash to implement prekindergarten, he plans to put the 3-K program in place gradually, hoping to avoid earlier mistakes. He has started city-financed pilot programs in several districts, chosen because classroom space was readily available.But the prekindergarten experience, and much of what has followed, has shown that Albany can be the hot griddle that Mr. de Blasio must dance on. Over the last three years, the mayor has been tortured over his control of city schools and his push for more affordable housing.When the mayor urged the state to create a $15 minimum wage for New York City, the governor said it was “a nonstarter”; months later, Mr. Cuomo released his own plan to back raise the minimum wage for the entire state.Mr. Shorris, the first deputy mayor, pointed out that Mr. Cuomo eventually became a champion of prekindergarten, just as he later came to support the $15 minimum wage.“However they get there, at the end of the day if we get him to the right place and he’s supportive of the kinds of things we’re trying to do, I think that’s great,” Mr. Shorris said of the governor. “But are there going to be bumps along the way? Yeah, sure.”
You Are Looking Live at Brent Musburger in the Casino LAS VEGAS — “You are looking live ...” was his signature intro over a sweeping camera shot, but instead of a snow-capped Lambeau Field or sunny Los Angeles Coliseum, Brent Musburger finds himself in a television studio plopped in the middle of a casino floor guarded by a battalion of one-armed bandits.Inside this glass box, Musburger, 78, is dressed in all black. He has traded “looking-live” greeting and weekend jaunts to football’s most hallowed athletic grounds to talk gambling five days a week to “My Guys in the Desert,” who today are Vinny Magliulo and Jimmy Vaccaro, bookmakers here at the South Point Casino.The old broadcaster’s cadences are as strong, his amiability as thick as it was in the mid-1970s when he anchored CBS’s pioneering live pregame show, N.F.L. Today, a mélange of features and football talk with a cast aimed at the widest demographic.Irv Cross was the ex-player and designated explainer of a sport that was in its infancy as televised entertainment. Phyllis George, a former Miss America, spoke to the softer side of a brutal game. Jimmy “The Greek” Snyder, who died in 1996, told gamblers which team to bet. Sort of. He picked a winner and final score, which signaled to gamblers how the teams would perform against the point spread.“He was our prognosticator,” Musburger said with a wink.More than four decades later, Musburger remains a trail blazer. He is he co-founder of Vegas Stats & Information Network (VSiN), a family business aimed at building a streaming service offering actionable information for sports bettors.In short, VSiN wants to be the CNBC for gamblers.It may be a niche market, but it is a booming one perhaps on the verge of exploding. Here in Nevada, sports betting is a nearly $5 billion a year industry. In December, the United States Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether to strike down a federal ban on betting amateur or professional games except in the four states that already have operations.The case was brought by the state of New Jersey, but more than a dozen other states have introduced legislation legalizing the activity in pursuit of what law enforcement and industry experts say is the $150 billion that is wagered annually with illegal or offshore bookmakers.In betting parlance, the over/under on sports betting becoming legal is three years. Musburger, who long has liked to wager a few bucks on games, takes the under.“You are not stopping gambling,” he said. “Learn to live with it and move on.”It was Brian Musburger, Brent’s nephew, who first envisioned a gambling network after overhearing a conversation between his uncle and Vacarro. He was an agent alongside his father, Todd, who had clients like Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers Coach Phil Jackson.“I was with him and a fly-on-the-wall in this conversation where Jimmy told Brent that he had gotten a phone call from a trainer of a team who told them that one of its stars had to have his ankles taped and wouldn’t be very mobile,” said Musburger. “So Jimmy adjusted the point spread.”While the networks and ESPN fill their sports broadcasts with features or opinion and fantasy draft shows, the younger Musburger targeted an underserved audience.“If you could bring people into the conversation that happens behind the scenes in the sports books, you have a different kind of sports talk,” Musburger said. “This is the nerve center. Their livelihood depends on getting credible information.”Brent Musburger knew his way around Las Vegas and the people that made it work.One of them was Mike Gaughan, the owner of the South Point.He saw a promotional opportunity and agreed to host VSiN. He built them a more than $1 million state of the art studio. The terms? VSiN agreed to pay him $1 annually for five years.Brian knew that his uncle was winding down a nearly 50-year broadcast career.“Unc, I need you,” he told Brent..On Jan. 25, Musburger announced his retirement from ESPN. Six days later, he called his last college basketball game, a Kentucky game at Rupp Arena. Less than two weeks later, he christened VSiN by anchoring a pregame show for Super Bowl LI.“I couldn’t leave the booth and not do anything – Arlene would have killed me,” Musburger said, referring to his wife of 54 years.Musburger’s day often ends here at a lounge across from the fishbowl studio. He fishes free drink vouchers from a battered briefcase and returns from the bar with a handful of Bud Lights. VSiN is a growing, but frugal operation: The network was launched with more than $1.6 million of mostly Musburger’s and friends’ money.With more than 80 hours of broadcast time to fill, VSiN leans on bookmakers from around town as well as reporters and analysts from various news organizations. There are remote look-ins and interviews from the other casinos. The network is simulcast on SiriusXM radio, and VSiN is producing short form videos for yahoo.com.It has launched a subscription digital magazine chock-full of stats and do-it-yourself handicapping methods with more specialized products – N.B.A. packets, for example — in the pipeline. It has attracted 1.4 million unique visitors (predominately male and affluent) who watch for an average of 26 minutes.Brian Musburger is raising an additional $10 million and says VSiN will grow tenfold on all platforms by the end of 2018.Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research, says the momentum Netflix has gained shows that information and entertainment is moving from a linear broadcast model to a streaming one.“Consumers are thirsty for more and more high quality content on streaming video content to watch on any device when and wherever you want,” Greenfield said.For now, however, the dulcet tones and informed – sometimes hot — opinions of a soon-to-be-inducted Hall of Fame broadcaster remain VSiN’s most valuable asset.Last month, he threw cold water on hosannas offered to Tony Romo, the former Dallas quarterback and now television analyst, who recently garnered praise for his ability to predict upcoming plays.“Tony, get off it. First of all, you’re intruding on your play-by-play man Jim Nantz, who’s just trying to give us the scene,” he said on his show. “and the more years you spend away from the league, you’re going to know less and less about the personnel that’s out on the field. So I’m blowing a ‘stop the hype’ right now.”Do not get him started on the hypocrisy of the N.F.L. when it comes on its stance against sports betting. He notes that two venerable owners, Art Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Tim Mara of the New York Giants, were close friends as well as gamblers, proud ones.The N.F.L. injury report became a staple of the league in 1947 when then commissioner Bert Bell learned of a bribe attempt on two players and realized that gambling on football was not going to go away.Musburger says the N.F.L. should drop its opposition to gambling and start addressing more pressing problems like anthem protests and players’ head injuries, which are contributing to lower television ratings and a decline in participation in youth football.“They are trying to figure out how to make money off it,” said Musburger. “Otherwise, why would they vote 31 to 1 to move the Oakland Raiders here unless they understood where it all was going?”Musburger’s veiled gambling references prompted viewers’ suspicions that he bet on games that he announced. After all, the name of his show, “My Guys in the Desert,” came from a phrase he uttered often to signal this was what his bookmaker friends here were thinking about the upcoming game.Musburger said that he did only once long ago on a Lakers game. When Kurt Rambis scored a late basket to make Musburger a loser, he said he felt like any other gambler watching a game because he had a few bucks on it rather than the broadcaster who will be inducted in the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame in December.Although VSiN personalities do not give out picks, Musburger put up $1,500 to play in the Westgate SuperContest, which attracts thousands of accomplished gamblers in search of nearly $5 million in prize money divided among the top 50 finishers. So far, he is above .500 and still in the hunt for a cash prize.Now about his “You are looking live ...” catch phrase – that was born as a service to his friends here in the desert. Throughout the run of “N.F.L. Today,” there was no Weather Channel or cellphones to check conditions, so Musburger came up with the idea of a live shot that not only served as a tease to the coming games but might move a gambling line.“Let’s face it – gambling is the foundation of the N.F.L, and every other sport’s popularity,” said Musburger. “It’s more fun to watch the game if you have a few bucks on it and in this day and age of information, it’s time to bring it in out of the dark. Gamblers are smart people. Let’s treat them like it.”
Pitch in All 7 Games of a World Series? A Dodger Just Might Do It LOS ANGELES — There is a reason it is rare to pitch in every game of the World Series. Two years ago, when Addison Reed did it for the Mets, he gave up five runs to Kansas City in Game 5 as the Royals clinched the title. On Sunday, when the Los Angeles Dodgers called yet again for Brandon Morrow, he served up four runs, including two homers, in just six weary pitches.Morrow’s velocity was down and his location was off, but both only slightly. Even so, Morrow said, he might have survived the top of the Houston Astros’ lineup if he could have found that mystical quality all pitchers need: life.The longtime starter Mike Mussina once explained that when a pitch lacks life — even if thrown hard — it seems to simply sputter to the plate, as if dead on arrival. But when a pitch has life, it seems as if it could carry right through the catcher, the umpire and the backstop. Morrow understands.“That’s like the last 1 percent of what you can get on the ball, kind of like the life on your arm translates out and through the baseball,” Morrow said in the Dodgers’ somber clubhouse after the Game 5 loss, a 13-12 crusher in 10 innings. “Even though I felt good, I guess I just didn’t have as much life in my arm as I was hoping.”One man familiar with Morrow’s arm is Darold Knowles, the rehabilitation pitching coach for the Toronto Blue Jays. When Knowles coached the Blue Jays’ Class A team in Dunedin, Fla., Morrow made annual visits while recovering from injuries each season from 2011 through 2014.Along the way, Morrow said, he came to learn Knowles’s claim to fame: he is the only pitcher to work seven games of a World Series, doing so for the Oakland Athletics in 1973, when they defeated the Mets. Even with so much bullpen specialization in the decades since, nobody has matched the feat.“It’s been 40-something years, and I always tell my wife it’s going to happen,” Knowles said by phone from Florida. “I think it will — and maybe this will be the year. It couldn’t happen to a nicer guy than Brandon.“He had a lot of injuries when he was a starter with the Blue Jays, but it looks like he’s found his niche,” Knowles said. “He always threw hard. I wouldn’t have thought he’d be able to go two or three days in a row, but obviously that’s not a problem.”It had not been a problem when Knowles spoke, just before Game 5. By then, Morrow had thrown 12⅓ postseason innings, with a 1.46 earned run average, as the primary setup man for Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen.But Game 5 was Morrow’s 12th outing in the Dodgers’ 13 postseason games, and by the time he was done, an 8-7 Los Angeles lead had become an 11-8 deficit after a homer by George Springer, a single by Alex Bregman, a double by Jose Altuve and another homer by Carlos Correa.Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts had said before the game that while Morrow was available, he hoped not to use him. But Clayton Kershaw did not survive the fifth inning, and Roberts deployed Kenta Maeda and Tony Watson to get through the sixth.He still had four relievers (not including Jansen) for the seventh — Ross Stripling, Tony Cingrani, Josh Fields and Brandon McCarthy — but Morrow had sent word from the bullpen insisting he was ready.“When I saw where the game was at in the seventh, I was getting loose and I was feeling O.K.,” Morrow said. “Probably selfish on my part to call down and push to let them know I’m ready and want to get in. They had a plan — we’re obviously very plan-oriented and try to stick to that – and I made them deviate away.”Then again, Morrow was telling the Dodgers what they wanted to hear. Roberts did not need much convincing.“I mean, I didn’t have to try too hard,” Morrow conceded. “I guess everybody’s trying to step up.”Roberts called it “a credit to him” that Morrow asked to pitch, and said it would have been hard to turn him down. Morrow, who signed a minor-league contract in January for $1.125 million, had a 2.06 E.R.A. with no home runs allowed over 45 games this season and averaged more than five and a half strikeouts per walk.“He was very good in spring training,” Roberts said. “You see the plus, plus velocity, and you always think, in a shorter stint, will his stuff play up? So he really embraced coming out of the pen this year, and he did that for our Triple-A club.”Morrow, who had pitched for a decade with Seattle, Toronto and San Diego, yearned for the intensity that comes with the major leagues. But he had pitched only 18 games for the Padres last season after shoulder surgery in 2015 had ended his career as a starter.“I was obviously hoping to get a major league deal,” said Morrow, who had a 1.69 E.R.A. in 18 games for San Diego. “I thought I threw the ball really well, but the swing-and-miss stuff wasn’t there, and the velocity wasn’t quite back all the way. Picking up the ball this year, though, something was different, like I knew I was stronger, ready to go. I felt like myself again.”Morrow has always had the stuff to dominate. Seattle drafted him fifth over all in 2006, out of the University of California, passing on Andrew Miller and three future Cy Young Award winners — Kershaw, Tim Lincecum and Max Scherzer — who went in the next six picks.The Mariners never found a steady role for Morrow, who has learned to manage Type 1 diabetes throughout his career. Traded to Toronto in December 2009, he periodically flourished as a starter, and lost a no-hitter with two outs in the ninth inning in 2010, finishing with a 137-pitch, 17-strikeout one-hitter. In 2012, he threw three shutouts through the first week in June.Then an oblique injury cost him more than two months. Forearm problems and a torn tendon in his hand hampered him in other seasons. No wonder, then, that with good health this season, Morrow has been eager to contribute as much as possible.Knowles can relate. In 1972, he was an eight-year major leaguer on an Oakland team bound for the World Series when a broken thumb in late September ended his season. The next year, the A’s won a five-game American League Championship Series without using Knowles at all.“I just wanted to get into a World Series game; everybody dreams of that,” Knowles said. “I was just thanking God I got into the first game, and I happened to get the save.”In that game, against the Mets, Knowles relieved closer Rollie Fingers with one out and one on in the ninth inning, protecting a 2-1 lead. The Mets had announced the left-handed Rusty Staub as a pinch-hitter against the right-handed Fingers, a future Hall of Famer. But when Oakland Manager Dick Williams called for the left-handed Knowles, the Mets’ manager, Yogi Berra, countered with a righty, Jim Beauchamp.Knowles retired Beauchamp on an infield pop and then got the left-handed Wayne Garrett to fly out to end the game.From there, Williams just kept calling for Knowles, who had 12 days of rest from the end of the regular season to the start of the World Series. He collected five outs in Game 2, and then faced 15 batters across the next three games at Shea Stadium.Facing elimination at home in Game 6, Williams used Knowles to replace another future Hall of Famer, Catfish Hunter, with a 2-0 lead, one out and one on in the eighth inning. Garrett and Felix Millan singled, cutting the lead to a run, but Knowles recovered to strike out Staub.“Yogi Berra said that was the biggest out of the series,” Knowles said. “It took giving up back-to-back hits for that to happen, so it wasn’t ideal.”Fingers got the final four outs of Game 6, and on the morning of Game 7, Knowles learned that no pitcher had ever worked all seven games of a World Series. He knew he might have a chance to be the first, but it almost didn’t come.Fingers entered Game 7 with one out in the sixth, and held a 5-1 lead with two outs in the ninth. But when first baseman Gene Tenace booted a grounder by Ed Kranepool, scoring a run, the left-handed Garrett came to the plate as the potential tying run. Knowles got his turn, retiring Garrett on a pop fly to short for the final out.“I told Dick Williams after Game 7, ‘You’re the dumbest manager I ever played for — you took out Rollie Fingers and you brought me in!’ ” Knowles said. “But he played everything by the book, and it worked out.”Knowles and Garrett are friends now; both live in Florida, and they sometimes golf together. Every time they see each other, Knowles said, he reminds Garrett of that final out.“I threw him three Nolan Ryan fastballs,” Knowles said, laughing. “I pitched all seven games and I think I threw only one slider all series. I was having trouble with it, so I junked it. I was not a power guy, but I had movement.”All pitchers learn to improvise when their best weapons betray them, and Morrow tried in Game 5. Without the life on his pitches, he failed, but he vowed to be ready for the rest of the World Series — meaning he still could tie his old coach’s record.“You just try to dig inside,” Morrow said, “and pull everything out that you’ve got.”
Baseball, Hot Dogs and Apple Pie. Washed Down With Champagne. LOS ANGELES — The tradition is well established by now: After a major league team clinches a playoff spot, advances to the next round or wins a championship, champagne and beer will almost certainly be sprayed.Aimlessly into the air. At reporters in the clubhouse. Down teammates’ backs or into their eyes. Or, rather, their goggles, if they choose to wear them.“You’ve got to let it burn,” said Clayton Kershaw, the ace of the Los Angeles Dodgers, after his team toppled the Chicago Cubs in the National League Championship Series two weeks ago to advance to its first World Series in 29 years. “Goggles are for the weak. You never know when you’re going to do this again. This might be our last turn.”Over the decades, baseball has developed a peculiar cycle: win, celebrate, clean up, repeat. Team employees do their best to prevent damage from the merriment by covering the walls and floors of clubhouses with plastic sheeting or disposable carpeting. It will still be messy and wild. What other workplace is like this?“All of this is so silly anyway,” observed Dodgers pitcher Brandon McCarthy. “We’re all wearing costumes to go out and play in the grass. None of this that happens here makes any sense, so it only makes sense that we celebrate in a way that doesn’t.”As Major League Baseball’s postseason is nearing the biggest celebration of all — the Houston Astros need one more victory to win the World Series, the Dodgers need two — it seems appropriate to ask: Where does this ritual come from?“Great question, but I have no idea,” said Cubs reliever Pedro Strop, who celebrated a lot last year when his team snapped a 108-year drought and finally won the Series. He was speaking during a slippery and sticky moment this month after the Cubs beat the Washington Nationals in a five-game division series.“It’s been like this for years,’’ he added. “It’s actually really fun. It’s like it’s raining and you’re running around to avoid getting wet.”Few, if any, sports seem to celebrate achievements as much as baseball teams do. In the other major professional sports leagues in North America, teams do not usually pop the corks until they win an actual championship.But that may be because other major sports do not play nearly as many games as baseball teams do. The 162-game regular season in baseball is twice as voluminous as the seasons in the N.B.A. and the N.H.L., and has about 10 times as many games as the N.F.L. season.So if a team clinches a playoff spot during the season — even if it is just the right to play in the win-or-go-home wild-card game — it is usually reason enough to break open the champagne and beer.“I always think it’s silly to do it celebrating a division or getting the wild card,” McCarthy said. “But then I thought about that. You might never get back there. If that’s the only time when you’re first up, why not?”If a major league team clinches a wild-card spot, wins the wild-card game, captures a division series and the league championship series, and then prevails in the World Series, that means five raucous, alcohol-filled celebrations in perhaps five or six weeks’ time. Four of them could occur within the span of three weeks in the postseason.“It’s extreme to go from nothing to four celebrations if you win,” said Los Angeles outfielder Curtis Granderson, who has reached the World Series three times in his career — with the Dodgers, Tigers and Mets. “It’s always been interesting to me.”Baseball championship celebrations involving champagne and beer have their roots in amateur baseball, dating back to the 19th century, according to research by John Thorn, the official historian of Major League Baseball.In the 20th century, there are instances of rambunctious festivities that go back to at least the 1940s. One involved the Brooklyn Dodgers, who in 1941 won their first National League pennant in 21 years. The clinching victory came against the Braves in Boston. Afterward, Larry McPhail, the Dodgers’ president, arranged for champagne to be stocked on the train for the team’s ride back to New York.By the time the train reached its destination, “the Dodgers were hilarious and the train was a wreck,” according to a newspaper account of their arrival. One of the Dodgers’ coaches, Chuck Dressen, had his shirt ripped off in the merriment, the article said. Two players, Pee Wee Reese and Pete Reiser, “prowled up and down the aisles squirting everybody with champagne.”Alcohol was also part of the postgame celebration after the legendary home run that Bobby Thomson hit in 1951 to allow the New York Giants to snatch the pennant from the Dodgers.And after the Dodgers won the 1956 N.L. pennant, their celebration was described as such in The New York Times: “Beer and champagne were being poured over the heads and into the hip pockets of those who still had uniforms on.”The celebrations have continued since then, but with various twists. Many players now use goggles, regardless of what Kershaw thinks. Not surprisingly, the New Era Cap Company, which makes the official caps for Major League Baseball, is now in the goggle business, too.One goggle-wearer is Josh Reddick, the Astros’ right fielder, who is notorious for his champagne-drenched reveling while wearing only stars-and-stripes briefs. He does not care if he looks ridiculous.“I love it,” he said in an interview last week. “For as long as I can remember, this is the way it’s been, so that’s what I’m accustomed to and I’ve gotten used to. So I don’t look at it from that perspective, like it being awkward, but it’s just what I’ve known and look forward to as a player.”Major League Baseball has tried to curb over-the-top celebrations with periodic guidelines concerning such things as the quantity of alcohol available or transportation provided for players and staff.Some players and baseball executives acknowledge they have not really thought about alternative ways to whoop it up.Karim Garcia, a retired outfielder from Mexico who spent parts of 10 seasons in the major leagues, said he was surprised when he first took part in a division-clinching celebration with the Dodgers in 1995. As it does now, most of the alcohol, including some expensive champagne, ended up on the floor or sprayed on the ceiling, and went unconsumed.“It was a great experience, and then you realize: ‘Why are you spraying and wasting it? Better to drink it,’” he said. “We probably should have just sprayed beer. It’s just one of those traditions that’s been around awhile and you just follow it. I think it’s the only place that we do it like this.”After winning titles in Mexican League baseball, Garcia said, his teams celebrated only with beer because it was cheaper.Astros reliever Tyler Clippard, a veteran of 11 major league seasons, said: “It is weird. But what else would you do? In the Indy 500, they drink milk. That’s way weirder. What should you do? Spray orange juice?”Farhan Zaidi, the Dodgers’ general manager, said spraying so much beer and champagne was probably not the “greatest bang-for-the-buck expense that we have as an organization, but it’s a tradition and this sport is full of it.”“If the celebration for winning different rounds of the playoffs was an elaborate high five, that’s what everybody would do and then go home,” he added. “It’s just what people have always done. But if aliens landed from another planet and saw this, they would think it was pretty bizarre.”
Review: ‘Red Roses, Green Gold’ Brings Back the Grateful Dead For an act to get the jukebox-musical treatment, hits are a minimum requirement. Abba, Frankie Valli and Carole King all had success on the charts before their music overtook Broadway with “Mamma Mia!,” “Jersey Boys” and “Beautiful.”The Grateful Dead had only one Top 10 song, “Touch of Grey,” and yet here is “Red Roses, Green Gold,” Off Broadway at the Minetta Lane Theater. Not only that, but this is the third show the writer Michael Norman Mann has created using the Dead’s catalog, after “Cumberland Blues” in 1998 and “Shakedown Street” in 2005.Not too bad for a band whose reputation was built on intense touring and extended live jams.The good news is that the songs, which lean heavily on a classic Americana sound, are effective in a sit-down, smoke-free theatrical context. The show, which is billed as “featuring the music of Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter” (Mr. Hunter was the Dead’s nonperforming lyricist), sometimes feels like a wacky relative of the Steve Martin and Edie Brickell Broadway bluegrass musical “Bright Star.”Even better for non-Deadheads, “Red Roses, Green Gold” lasts just over two hours rather than four, with numbers that mostly clock in around three or four minutes.Unfortunately, Mr. Mann has shoehorned them into a cartoonishly corny story.Like “Cumberland Blues,” the show takes place in a theme-park version of a Maryland mining town in the 1920s, more specifically at the saloon and mining company owned by the debonair Jackson Jones (Scott Wakefield). Alas, a pair of scheming brothers (Brian Russell Carey and Michael McCoy Reilly) have their sights on taking over the Palace, which is that in name only.To nobody’s surprise, their plan is foiled at the last minute, thanks in no small part to Jackson’s prodigal son, Mick, played by Michael Viruet as a Jimi Hendrix-esque rogue prone to flashing his nipple rings and manscaped torso. While I am not a professional historian, these do not appear to be period- or setting-accurate.The zany mood is furthered by Rachel Klein’s bouncy staging and Ásta Bennie Hostetter’s colorful costumes, which land somewhere between Laurel Canyon hippie bohemia and carnivalesque traveling show, with nods to the Dead’s trademark red roses and skeletons.As manic as the goings-on are, they cannot entirely detract from the music, which borrows extensively the Dead’s two best studio albums, “American Beauty” and “Workingman’s Dead,” both from 1970 — plus, yes, “Touch of Grey.” Arranged by the keyboardist Jeff Chimenti, a longtime satellite in the Dead galaxy, the songs are drenched in folk, country and blues, and rendered quite well by the multitasking cast, which plays all the instruments.“Truckin’” and “Friend of the Devil” rumble along like the classic bar boogies they are, but the most striking numbers are the quietest ones, such as “Box of Rain,” delivered by Natalie Storrs and David Park, who portray Jackson’s daughter and her love interest.When the cast comes back for encores, Ms. Storrs belts out the kind of vocal runs that are Broadway’s answer to jammy solos. The world of music is smaller than you may think.
Review: ‘Illyria’ Eavesdrops on a Young Joe Papp and Friends You have been invited to eavesdrop on a great man’s birthday party. He is not, at this point, widely regarded as any kind of titan. The mantle that will later be conferred by headlines, testimonials and biographies has yet to fall upon his shoulders.But if you keep quiet and behave well, even when others at this improvised shindig do not, you’ll hear the murmur of cultural history in the making. Strange, isn’t it, how very ordinary it sounds? And how annoyingly aggrieved and, well, small the birthday boy appears in his sulky silence.Richard Nelson’s “Illyria,” a grave and gossipy whisper of a play set in the Bohemian grooves of Manhattan in 1958, portrays a time when our 37-year-old birthday boy was down on his luck and feeling defeated. His name, by the way, is Joe Papp. That’s the guy who founded the Public Theater, which is the place where Mr. Nelson’s latest drama opened on Monday night.Embodied with a distracted air and a sneaky tyrannical streak by the excellent John Magaro, Joe isn’t squarely in the spotlight for much of this production, which is directed by Mr. Nelson. But if you lean in and listen — and you’ll have to, since people evidently mumbled in the late 1950s — you’ll detect the tidal tug of an ego that would reshape the landscape of New York theater.Among American dramatists, Mr. Nelson is the great master of medias res, thrusting audiences into the midst of critical conversations that were initiated long before the curtain goes up. It’s a technique he has realized to perfection in his great cyclical works set in Rhinebeck, N.Y., “The Apple Family Plays” and “The Gabriels,” staged at the Public Theater between 2010 and 2016.Those uniquely topical dramas explored of-the-moment events through the eyes of two different families. They were vivid slice-of-life works in which meals were prepared and consumed, as the people onstage looked at a changing nation from their own beleaguered corner of it.Mr. Nelson takes a similarly sideways approach in “Illyria,” with more mixed results. If you don’t know much about the real Joseph Papp (1921-1991), you may wonder what the heck’s going on and why you should be interested. If you do know a lot about Papp and his associates, you may be a bit exasperated by the liberties Mr. Nelson has taken in bringing them to life.But “Illyria” also affords distinctive if fleeting pleasures that no one these days does better than Mr. Nelson. I mean the sense of experiencing life, in all its trivia and eventfulness, happening in a very specific moment, among people who know one another well. And once again, Mr. Nelson has assembled a fine cast that wears its alter egos with the ease of old cardigans.Aside from Joe, only one of the characters is likely to be familiar to much of the audience. That’s the formidable actress Colleen Dewhurst (played by Rosie Benton), who is just beginning to forge a career in the late 1950s. In “Illyria,” she appears as the hostess of the last-minute birthday bash in the play’s second scene, and she by no means dominates the proceedings.Though the scandalous professional behavior of her future husband, George C. Scott, is much discussed, Colleen is just one of many theatrical aspirants here, a band of almost equals still struggling to make a living. She’s part of Joe’s nascent New York Shakespeare Festival, which puts on plays from the canon for free in the city’s parks.Others on the team include Joe’s actress wife, Peggy (Kristen Connolly), who has just had a baby; the press agent Merle Debuskey (Fran Kranz); the stage manager John Robertson (Max Woertendyke); and the composer David Amram (Blake DeLong). The resident director is Stuart Vaughan (John Sanders), whose wife, Gladys (Emma Duncan), is Joe’s assistant.Local theater buffs may recognize the names of Mr. Debuskey and Mr. Vaughan, as well as that of another character, Bernie Gersten (Will Brill), a longtime friend of Papp’s who would become a producer at his Shakespeare Festival and later Lincoln Center. The dramatis personae is rounded out by Mary Bennett (Naian González Norvind), a young actress new to this insular world.Mostly these people just talk and, this being a play by Mr. Nelson, eat (sandwiches, generally). The subjects of conversation melt and swirl and resurface in thick eddies. They include who to cast as Olivia in “Twelfth Night,” Peggy’s reluctant return to the stage and the consequences of Joe’s and Bernie’s being summoned before the House Un-American Activities Committee for suspected Communist affiliations.The political taint of such presumed associations has put Joe’s fledging troupe in jeopardy, and we hear accounts of his run-ins with the city’s parks department, then overseen by the mighty Robert Moses. Will the establishment put the kibosh on these maverick idealists? Will “Twelfth Night” in Central Park, the occasion for the play’s third and final scene, be this troupe’s last production?These dramatic questions are not posed with histrionic flourish in “Illyria.” (The title comes from the fantastical setting for “Twelfth Night.”) Often they loom less large than romantic crosscurrents and nagging rivalries, particularly between Joe and the more successful Stuart, whom Mr. Sanders portrays with a canny subliminal smugness.Theatergoers expecting the explosions, resolutions and emotional payoffs of a conventionally well-made play are likely to leave “Illyria” frustrated. Though it verges on starry-eyed sentimentality in its final scene, most of this production — designed with spot-on period detail by Susan Hilferty and Jason Ardizzone-West — refrains from thematic signposting.Instead, it inhabits a landscape where the petty and the momentous are practically indistinguishable, and even the strongest feelings are muddied with ambivalence. The real Joe Papp, showman that he was, might have deemed “Illyria” too muted and inconclusive to be satisfying.Theatergoers with patience, though, will be rewarded by moments throughout when they will feel transformed into proverbial flies on the walls of a distant time and place. Real life is happening, as boring and confusing and riveting as it usually appears without the magnifying lens of hindsight.
Rock, Reminiscence and Sci-Fi Will Be Part of Under the Radar Festival The Public Theater’s 2018 Under the Radar Festival will feature pieces inspired by the work of the pioneering science fiction writer Octavia Butler and the influential rock critic Lester Bangs, as well as an autobiographical show from the New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik.The theater on Tuesday announced the lineup of the festival, which, in its 14th year, is dedicated to exposing audiences to works that fall outside of the mainstream. Among the troupes that gained recognition at the festival are Elevator Repair Service and the Belarus Free Theater.While Mark Russell, the festival’s director, said he doesn’t program according to a theme, he mentioned the show “Parable of the Sower,” based on the Butler novels “Parable of the Sower” and “Parable of the Talents,” as emblematic of the lineup.An operatic adaptation by the mother and daughter Toshi Reagon and Bernice Johnson Reagon, the dystopian story follows a young woman named Lauren as she moves through her life in a crumbling America.“That’s what we decided would be the heart of the festival and then I started moving from there,” he said on Monday, pointing to Andrew Schneider’s “After” and Dickie Beau’s Hamlet-inspired “Re-Member Me” as other notable building blocks.Writers’ lives inspire several shows. “The Gates: An Evening of Stories with Adam Gopnik” is an autobiographical suite of stories focusing on the writer’s early life in New York in the ’80s and his life in the much-transformed city of today.“How to Be a Rock Critic” tells the story of Lester Bangs’s life in a solo show that explores the connection between the trajectory of rock ’n’ roll in the 1970s and the fate of the music critic.Under the Radar has presented companies hailing from more than 40 countries over the years. This year’s international offerings include pieces by Cuba’s Teatro El Público, Italy’s Motus and Japan’s Satoshi Miyagi.When asked about the diversity of the festival’s slate, Mr. Russell said, “I’m trying to make a festival for the City of New York, as I dream it, so it’s great to be able to have all these groups be able to collaborate with us.”Under the Radar is scheduled to run Jan. 4-15 at the Public’s Manhattan venue and other sites, including the N.Y.U. Skirball Center and BRIC. For more information, go to undertheradarfestival.com.
Many Academics Are Eager to Publish in Worthless Journals Call it a classic case of supply meeting demand.Universities, colleges, even community colleges insist that faculty publish scholarly research, and the more papers the better. Academics and the schools they teach at rely on these publications to bolster their reputations, and with an oversupply of Ph.D.’s vying for jobs, careers hang in the balance.Competition is fierce to get published in leading journals. But what about the overworked professors at less prestigious schools and community colleges, without big grants and state-of-the-art labs? How do they get ahead?As it turns out, many of their articles are appearing in “journals” that will publish almost anything, for fees that can range into the hundreds of dollars per paper. These publications often are called predatory journals, on the assumption that well-meaning academics are duped into working with them — tricked by flattering emails from the journals inviting them to submit a paper or fooled by a name that sounded like a journal they knew.But it’s increasingly clear that many academics know exactly what they’re getting into, which explains why these journals have proliferated despite wide criticism. The relationship is less predator and prey, some experts say, than a new and ugly symbiosis.Many faculty members — especially at schools where the teaching load is heavy and resources few — have become eager participants in what experts call academic fraud that wastes taxpayer money, chips away at scientific credibility, and muddies important research.“When hundreds of thousands of publications appear in predatory journals, it stretches credulity to believe all the authors and universities they work for are victims,” Derek Pyne, an economics professor at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia, wrote in a op-ed published in the Ottawa Citizen, a Canadian newspaper.The number of such journals has exploded to more than 10,000 in recent years, with nearly as many predatory as legitimate ones. “Predatory publishing is becoming an organized industry,” wrote one group of critics in a paper in Nature.Many of these journals have names that closely resemble those of established publications, making them easily mistakable. There is the Journal of Economics and Finance, published by Springer, but now also the Journal of Finance and Economics. There is the Journal of Engineering Technology, put out by the American Society for Engineering Education, but now another called the GSTF Journal of Engineering Technology.Predatory journals have few expenses, since they do not seriously review papers that are submitted and they publish only online. They blast emails to academics, inviting them to publish. And the journals often advertise on their websites that they are indexed by Google Scholar. Often that is correct — but Google Scholar does not vet the journals it indexes.The journals are giving rise to a wider ecosystem of pseudo science. For the academic who wants to add credentials to a résumé, for instance, publishers also hold meetings where, for a hefty fee, you can be listed as a presenter — whether you actually attend the meeting or not.One of those meetings, held in New York in June by a group called the World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, seemed more like a Potemkin village. On the publisher’s website, the convention promised to be large and lavish.But when I visited, the only venue was a small windowless room on the sixth floor of a hotel undergoing renovation. A handful of people sat in the room, diligently listening to a talk. Most who were listed on the program were not in attendance.Participating in such dubious enterprises carries few risks. Dr. Pyne, who did a study of his colleagues’ publications, reports that faculty members at his school who got promoted last year had at least four papers in questionable journals. All but one academic in 10 who won a School of Business and Economics award had published papers in these journals. One had 10 such articles.Academics get rewarded with promotions when they stuff their résumés with articles like these, Dr. Pyne concluded. There are few or no adverse consequences — in fact, the rewards for publishing in predatory journals were greater than for publishing in legitimate ones.Dr. Pyne does not know what role those studies played in the promotions. But, he said, “I can say that such publications do not seem to hurt promotion prospects.”Tensions over this kind of scholarship have spilled over Queensborough Community College, part of CUNY, the City University of New York.Although it is hardly known for its research, college administrators urge the faculty to publish. Recently a group of concerned professors complained that nearly a dozen colleagues have repeatedly published in at least one of the dubious journals — and have been promoted and rewarded for it.Noting that a number of these papers apparently depended on federal and city funds, the professors brought the matter to the attention of the vice chancellor for research and even wrote to the New York State inspector general’s office.The school referred inquiries to its head librarian, Jeanne Galvin.“Just as with many colleges, faculty submit their work for publication in a variety of journals based on individual judgment,” she said in an email. “Queensborough offers several advisory resources, such as workshops and individual consultation with expert librarians. The research that I have seen published by our faculty is of the highest quality.”Some say the academic system bears much of the blame for the rise of predatory journals, demanding publications even from teachers at places without real resources for research and where they may have little time apart from teaching.At Queensborough, faculty members typically teach nine courses per year. At four-year colleges, faculty may teach four to six courses a year.Yet “every university requires some level of publication,” said Lawrence DiPaolo, vice president of academic affairs at Neumann University in Aston, Pa.Recently a group of researchers invented a fake academic: Anna O. Szust. The name in Polish means fraudster. Dr. Szust applied to legitimate and predatory journals asking to be an editor. She supplied a résumé in which her publications and degrees were total fabrications, as were the names of the publishers of the books she said she had contributed to.The legitimate journals rejected her application immediately. But 48 out of 360 questionable journals made her an editor. Four made her editor in chief. One journal sent her an email saying, “It’s our pleasure to add your name as our editor in chief for the journal with no responsibilities.”The lead author of the Dr. Szust sting operation, Katarzyna Pisanski, a psychologist at the University of Sussex in England, said the question of what motivates people to publish in such journals “is a touchy subject.”“If you were tricked by spam email you might not want to admit it, and if you did it wittingly to increase your publication counts you might also not want to admit it,” she said in an email.The consequences of participating can be more than just a résumé freckled with poor-quality papers and meeting abstracts. Publications become part of the body of scientific literature.There are indications that some academic institutions are beginning to wise up to the dangers.Dewayne Fox, an associate professor of fisheries at Delaware State University, sits on a committee at his school that reviews job applicants. One recent applicant, he recalled, listed 50 publications in such journals and is on the editorial boards of some of them.A few years ago, he said, no one would have noticed. But now he and others on search committees at his university have begun scrutinizing the publications closely to see if the journals are legitimate.“If something gets published in one of these journals and it’s complete garbage, it can develop a life of its own,” Dr. Fox said.“Think about human medicine and how much is on the line. When people publish something that is not replicable, it can have health impacts.”
June Robles Birt, Whose Abduction at 6 Gripped the Nation, Is Dead at 87 By 1934, Tucson figured its Wild West days were behind it. The legendary gunfight at the O.K. Corral, down the road in Tombstone, had occurred fully a half-century before, and Tucson was blooming as a desert mecca for tourists and respiratory patients.True, John Dillinger and his bank-robbing gang had been captured at the Hotel Congress there that January, but they were holed up in Tucson only because they had decided that the city, population 32,000, was so removed from the nation’s mainstream violence that they would never be noticed there.So when 6-year-old June Robles, the granddaughter of a prosperous cattle baron and real estate magnate, vanished in broad daylight just after leaving her Tucson school on a spring day in 1934, news of her disappearance shattered the city’s calm and swept across the country in terrifying front-page headlines, stoking Americans’ already prevalent fears about the lucrative — and sometimes deadly — crime of child abduction. Only two years earlier, the 20-month-old son of the aviator Charles A. Lindbergh Jr. had been snatched from his New Jersey home, held for ransom and murdered.The Robles abduction had a happier, if bizarre, ending, however. Nineteen days later, June was found bewildered but alive in a makeshift wood-and-sheet-metal cage buried in the broiling desert. Americans could heave a collective sigh of relief.For months, her disappearance had remained the only open case among more than 30 abductions that the F.B.I. had investigated since kidnapping was made a federal crime in response to the Lindbergh case.June Robles’s disappearance was never solved, and as decades and generations came and went, the case became a mostly forgotten footnote in the annals of crime. The headlines disappeared, and so, too, did June Robles — at least from public view. For the next 80 years she led a reticent if not obscure life, never leaving the city where she was born.She died in Tucson on Sept. 2, 2014, apparently of complications of Parkinson’s disease. She was 87.At the time, her family placed a paid death notice in The Arizona Daily Star under her married name, June Birt, but apparently no news obituary — no coda to a spectacular case — was ever written.The New York Times learned of her death late last month in an emailed inquiry from a writer who was researching another child abduction for a book.“Little June” Robles, as she was invariably called, spoke to news reporters immediately after her rescue, but in subsequent years she never sat for a full-fledged interview. She wrote no memoirs. On anniversaries of the kidnapping, the case might be reprised in newspapers and magazines and on television news programs, but there was scant information about what had happened to her since. A lengthy wedding announcement in 1950 made no mention of her ordeal in the national spotlight 16 years earlier.What had happened, according to a forthcoming book by Paul Cool for the Arizona Historical Society, was that after the tumult of her brief national celebrity, Ms. Robles was determined to remain inconspicuous from then on.“That was the way she wanted it,” her son James Robles said in a telephone interview this week. “That was the way she wished it. That was the way it was meant to be.”He added: “Most of the people who know about this are all dead, and I don’t know why it’s even news now. Most everyone connected with the case just wanted it to go away.”June Cecilia Robles was born in Tucson on June 11, 1927. Her mother was the former Helen Mauler, from Kansas. Her father, Fernando Robles, was a former railway clerk who owned an electrical supply store. He was the son and a presumptive heir of Bernabe Robles, a Mexican-born descendant of Spanish conquistadors. Bernabe was 7 in 1864, when he immigrated to the United States with his mother on a burro.By 1934 Bernabe Robles had amassed a fortune as a cattle baron and entrepreneur. He had acquired vast tracts of Arizona real estate, initially to provide scarce water for the horses that powered a stage coach line he also owned. As Tucson developed beyond its original borders, the value of his property had multiplied. That led some Tucsonians to speculate that the kidnappers had been enticed by his wealth.The abduction occurred on the afternoon of April 25 as June was walking alone from the Roskruge public school to visit an aunt, according to court testimony. She was trailing behind her 6-year-old cousin, who had gone on ahead.A man approached her. He said her father had asked him to give her a lift to his store. After some cajoling, she got into his car, a black Ford sedan.Later that day, a local boy handed her father a ransom note. The boy said an unidentified man had given him 25 cents to deliver it. The note demanded $15,000 (about $300,000 in today’s money). Mr. Robles scribbled a reply — its text was not reported — and gave it to the boy to carry back to the kidnapper. According to the testimony, however, when the boy looked for the man, he was gone.The next day, a second ransom note, signed “Z,” was delivered to June’s grandfather. The ransom demand had been reduced to $10,000. Fernando Robles and his twin brother, Carlos, the assistant Pima County prosecutor, scraped together the money, apparently after their father, Bernabe, had declined to contribute.Meanwhile, a posse of hundreds of gun-toting cowboys, ranchers and Apache scouts scoured the rugged terrain on horseback. Bernabe Robles secretly consulted a psychic in Mexico. A plane scouted the 70 miles to the border and beyond.“We have run down clue after clue, which has faded into nothing,” Tucson’s police chief, Gus Wollard, said.Fernando Robles asked law-enforcement officials to suspend their search and to cancel a $1,500 reward so that he could deal with the kidnapper directly.“Only one thing now is left,” he said in an appeal published on April 30. “I must get in touch with these people. I want my baby back.”To prove that June was still alive, Fernando Robles urged her captors to send him the answers to four questions addressed to his daughter. One question was “What do you do with your bunnies in the morning?”On Monday night, May 7, a third ransom note was slipped under the door of the county prosecutor’s office in the Pima County Courthouse.“If you had listened to us, your child would be with you,” the note said. It was signed “XYZ.”A week later, Gov. B. B. Moeur received an airmail letter postmarked Chicago. Inside was a crude map and directions to a site in the remote desert, about nine miles from downtown Tucson, where the sender said the Robles girl’s “body” could be found.That prompted a search by June’s uncle Carlos Robles and his boss, Clarence Houston, the county attorney. It was Mr. Houston who, after more than three fruitless hours, stumbled over a mound of dirt covered with sagebrush, mesquite and cholla cactus. Beneath it, he discovered a perforated sheet of metal, which proved to be the top of a narrow, coffinlike underground cage.“I was sure June was dead,” Carlos Robles told The New York Times. Inside, Little June looked up, dazed by the sudden sunlight and by her surprise liberator.“Hello, June, do you know me?” Mr. Houston asked. “Are you afraid of me?”“No, I’m not afraid of you,” she replied. “I want my mama.”The girl was filthy, blistered by prickly heat and bitten by ants, her ankles chafed by chains attached to an iron stake. She said she had subsisted on fruit, bread and jam, potato chips and graham crackers that the kidnappers had left. She had made do with a ceramic pot for a toilet.Immediately after her rescue, as she was escorted away, all she seemed concerned about was her report card, which she had left behind in her underground cell. “I went back and got it,” she told The Tucson Daily Citizen. “I wanted my mama to see it.”Describing her abduction to British Pathé News, June said one kidnapper had threatened her. “He was going to spank me if I was going to cry,” she said. Her grandmother was quoted as saying, “The kidnappers said they would put a knife in her back if she cried.”June’s rescue was trumpeted around the world. The New York Times reported the story as its lead article on the front page under a three-line headline stretched across four columns.The kidnappers were never found. A local dance-hall operator, a friend of June’s father, was charged after his handwriting was found to be similar to that used in one of the ransom notes, but the case against him collapsed.Tucsonians were filled with questions: Why had a ransom note been delivered to the prosecutor? Could June really have survived 19 days underground? Why didn’t her wealthy grandfather front the ransom? What was the Chicago connection?In December 1936, after several suspects had been interrogated, a federal grand jury concluded that there was not enough evidence to accuse anyone. It described June’s baffling disappearance as an “alleged kidnapping.”J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the F.B.I., apparently shared the grand jury’s skepticism. “We have had 36 kidnappings listed, and all of them are solved on our records,” he said.Seeking to capitalize on the publicity, June’s parents hoped to send the girl on a vaudeville tour to raise $1,500 in reward money for the arrest of the kidnappers. But when they sought more, to pay for her education, Hollywood promoters balked.June was enrolled in a Roman Catholic school, where she was escorted daily under guard. “I simply cannot bear to leave my children alone for a minute,” Helen Robles told The Tucson Daily Citizen.June earned a degree in business administration from the University of Arizona in 1948 and, after graduation, worked for the school’s registrar.The last time Little June was interviewed, in 1936, she said that all she had wanted was “to be a mother like my mother.” And that was what she became.Her marriage in 1950 was to Dancey Birt, an aircraft factory supervisor at the time. He survives her. Besides her son James, she is also survived by three other children, Thomas, Bruce and Barbara; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.
Fred Beckey, Conqueror and Chronicler of North American Peaks, Dies at 94 Fred Beckey, a fabled mountaineer and author who was the first to take hundreds of routes to the summits of North America’s tallest peaks in Alaska, the Canadian Rockies and the Pacific Northwest in an audacious seven-decade climbing career, died on Monday in Seattle. He was 94.Megan Bond, a close friend of Mr. Beckey’s, wrote in a Facebook message that he died of congestive heart failure in her home. A longtime resident of Seattle, he had been in hospice care for four days, she said.Rawboned and tenacious, Mr. Beckey made as many as a thousand ascents that no one was known to have taken before. He wrote a dozen books on mountaineering, many of them considered definitive guides to the terrain of the continent’s best-known and least accessible peaks.Mr. Beckey was virtually unknown to the general public — the exact opposite of Sir Edmund Hillary, the New Zealander who, with his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay, won worldwide fame by conquering Earth’s tallest peak, the 29,029-foot Mount Everest, on the Nepal-Tibet border in 1953.Indeed, Mr. Beckey shunned publicity and people. He lived like a hermit in Seattle, holing up to write or vanishing for months on expeditions. He looked like a scruffy hobo — a wiry, stooped nomad with a backpack, a shapeless jacket, dirty pants and sneakers. But he was all-purpose: the craggy face leathery from sun, wind and snow; powerful hands scarred with cuts; flyaway hair crushed under a woolen cap; keen eyes for the next toehold; and a toothy smile for the book signings.He never married or had children, never had a business or sought security. Friends said he just wanted to climb mountains.But to the fraternity of climbing enthusiasts around the world, he was a phenomenon whose exploits above clouds and tree lines at 10,000 to 20,000 feet resounded in mountaineering lore and journals: the achievements of an eccentric daredevil who took on the continent’s last unclimbed peaks and uncharted routes, who probably took more risks than anyone in history.He wrote guidebooks and lectured for the cognoscenti, Americans and Canadians who appreciated the history, topography and perilous beauty of their wilderness strongholds, and for those who hoped to test their mettle on glacial escarpments with rope, ice ax and aching limbs for the reward of standing on the crown of a mountain called Terror or Despair, overlooking a vast panorama of the world.“If Thoreau and Emerson describe the transcendental American theme, then Beckey — after Ahab, akin to Kerouac — describes the oddly manic drive to scale and map and detail the wilderness in a modern way,” Steve Costie, executive director of the Mountaineers, a Seattle-based outdoor recreation group, told The New York Times in 2008, when Mr. Beckey was in his 72nd year of mountaineering.He climbed Africa’s tallest peak, Mount Kilimanjaro (19,341 feet), and Switzerland’s highest massif, Monte Rosa (15,203). But he rarely ventured into the Himalayas, straddling the borders of China and India, where a dozen of the world’s greatest summits defied human intrusion for centuries, rising more than five miles above sea level into an otherworldly realm of yawning abysses, 100-mile-an-hour winds, perpetual cold, and air so thin that the human brain and lungs cannot function properly in it.While other experienced mountaineers repeated ascents of Himalayan and Andean peaks for speed records, Mr. Beckey roamed North America in search of unconquered summits and routes considered too difficult to climb. He often climbed 40 or 50 different peaks a year.He was not the first to climb Alaska’s Denali (20,310), North America’s highest peak (formerly known as Mount McKinley). A team did that in 1913. But in 1954 he and several friends achieved mountaineering’s Triple Crown by reaching the caps of the Alaska Range giants: Mounts Hunter (14,573) and Deborah (12,339) — both in virgin ascents — and Denali’s rarely climbed North Peak (19,470).In a notoriously dangerous sport, Mr. Beckey sustained a crushed rib cage and another climber, Charles Shiverick, was killed when an avalanche carried them a quarter of a mile down Mount Serra in British Columbia in 1947. An ice pinnacle snared Mr. Beckey’s rope, saving him, but his companion struck a rock and died of internal injuries.In an international expedition in 1955 to conquer the world’s fourth-highest peak, Lhotse (27,940) in the Himalayas, Mr. Beckey was denounced by colleagues for abandoning his tentmate with a cerebral edema at 23,000 feet in a howling blizzard the night before they were to attempt the summit. He descended alone, he said, to get help.The stricken man, snow-blind and nearly frozen without a sleeping bag, was rescued by others, but it was a misadventure that Mr. Beckey never lived down. While he was a compelling choice for the first American team assault on Everest in 1963, he was not invited — a snub that ended his Himalayan forays and confirmed his preference for climbing alone or with a few companions.Mr. Beckey was caught in shrieking gales, trapped on rock ledges and buried in avalanches. But he was rarely hurt seriously, a testament perhaps to fine judgments: How to cross a snowfield that might conceal a crevasse? Where to hammer a piton into rock or ice to secure a rope on which life might hang? Where to cling or step when hugging a sheer vertical rock face over an abyss?“This man survived nearly 1,000 first ascents, where a climber doesn’t know where to go and often has to deal with loose rock,” Peter Green, director of the outdoor program at Portland’s Catlin Gabel School, told The Oregonian in 2012. “It’s amazing he’s still alive. His decision-making and judgment must be so good.”Wolfgang Beckey was born on Jan. 14, 1923, near Düsseldorf, Germany, to Klaus and Marta Maria Beckey. His father was a surgeon and his mother an opera singer.The family, including a brother, Helmut, emigrated to Seattle in 1925. The boy called himself Fred and learned climbing techniques as a Boy Scout and in a Mountaineers course.He is survived by his brother, who Ms. Bond said lives in Germany.At 13, Fred and two friends reached the top of Mount Despair, a rugged 7,292-foot peak in the North Cascades that mountaineers had considered unclimbable. He soon began making local history climbing summits in the Olympic and North Cascade ranges.He loved skiing, and in 1942 he joined the wartime Army’s 10th Mountain Division, based in Colorado. After the war, he attended the University of Washington, but spent most of his time with his brother and friends scaling peaks in Washington, Wyoming, California and Oregon, the Bitterroots in Montana, the Bugaboos in British Columbia and desert rock formations in the Southwest.After graduating in 1949 with a degree in business administration, he sold ads for The Seattle Post-Intelligencer and was a print shop sales representative. He also finished his first book, “Climber’s Guide to the Cascade and Olympic Mountains of Washington” (1949).Later books included “Challenge of the North Cascades” (1969); “Cascade Alpine Guide,” a three-volume set with many editions (1973 to 2008); “Mountains of North America” (1982); “Mount McKinley: Icy Crown of North America” (1993); “Range of Glaciers: The Exploration and Survey of the Northern Cascade Range” (2003); and “Fred Beckey’s 100 Favorite North American Climbs” (2011).His home was plastered with photos of his conquests, including two named for him: Beckey’s Spire, also known as Christianity Spire, in Sedona, Ariz., which he climbed in 1970, and Mount Beckey, an 8,500-foot Alaskan peak in the Cathedral Mountains, which he climbed in 1996.Friends called him a cantankerous cuss who hated talk about himself. He sped long distances in his old pink Thunderbird, screaming all night to stay awake at the wheel, and howled at tourists who gawked at his camps. On a mountain, he amazed fellow climbers with his uphill speed and stamina, even in his 80s.“I guess you have your choice of trying to make money or getting involved with adventure,” Mr. Beckey told Lincoln Stoller for the Learning Project in 2007. “Most people get married, and by the time they’re 30 they’ve got a couple of kids, and then they’re strapped down. Then they have to work.”
Dennis Banks, American Indian Civil Rights Leader, Dies at 80 Dennis J. Banks, the militant Chippewa who founded the American Indian Movement in 1968 and led often-violent insurrections to protest the treatment of Native Americans and the nation’s history of injustices against its indigenous peoples, died on Sunday night at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. He was 80.His daughter Tashina Banks Rama said the cause was complications of pneumonia following successful open-heart surgery a week ago at the clinic. Mr. Banks lived on the Leech Lake Reservation in northern Minnesota, where he was born and where he grew up.Mr. Banks and his Oglala Sioux compatriot Russell Means were by the mid-1970s perhaps the nation’s best-known Native Americans since Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, who led the attack that crushed the cavalry forces of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in the Montana Territory in 1876.Mr. Banks, whose early life of poverty, alcoholism and alienation mirrored the fates of countless ancestors, led protests that caused mass disorder, shootouts, deaths and grievous injuries. He was jailed for burglary and convicted of riot and assault, and he became a fugitive for nine years. He found sanctuary in California and New York but finally gave up and was imprisoned for 14 months.He once led a six-day takeover of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, and mounted an armed 71-day occupation of the town of Wounded Knee, S.D., on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Wounded Knee was the scene of the last major conflict of the American Indian Wars, in which 350 Lakota men, women and children were massacred by United States troops in 1890.While his protests won some government concessions and drew national attention and wide sympathy for the deplorable social and economic conditions of American Indians, Mr. Banks achieved few real improvements in the daily lives of millions of Native Americans, who live on reservations and in major cities and lag behind most fellow citizens in jobs, housing and education.To admirers, Mr. Banks was a broad-chested champion of native pride. With dark, piercing eyes, high cheekbones, a jutting chin and long raven hair, he was a paladin who defied authority and, in an era crowded with civil rights protests, spoke for the nation’s oldest minority.To his critics, including many American Indians, Mr. Banks was a self-promoter, grabbing headlines and becoming a darling of politically liberal Hollywood stars like Jane Fonda and Marlon Brando. His severest detractors, including law-enforcement officials, said he let followers risk injury and arrest while he jumped bail to avoid a long prison sentence and did not surrender for nearly a decade.Mr. Banks and Mr. Means first won national attention for declaring a “Day of Mourning” for Native Americans on Thanksgiving Day in 1970. Their band seized the ship Mayflower II, a replica of the original in Plymouth, Mass., and a televised confrontation between real Indians and costumed “Pilgrims” made the American Indian Movement leaders overnight heroes.In 1972, the two organized cross-country car caravans on “Trails of Broken Treaties.” They converged on Washington with 500 followers to protest Indian living standards and lost treaty rights, occupied the Bureau of Indian Affairs and held out for nearly a week, destroying documents and the premises, until the government agreed to discuss Indian grievances and review treaty commitments.In 1973, after a white man killed an Indian in a saloon brawl and was charged not with murder but with involuntary manslaughter, Mr. Banks led 200 American Indian Movement protesters in a face-off with the police in Custer, S.D. It became a riot when the slain man’s mother was beaten by officers. After he left town, Mr. Banks, who said he had merely tried to ease tensions, was charged with assault and rioting.It was the last straw. “We had reached a point in history where we could not tolerate the abuse any longer, where mothers could not tolerate the mistreatment that goes on on the reservations any longer, where they could not see another Indian youngster die,” he told the author Peter Matthiessen.Weeks later, the siege that made Mr. Banks and Mr. Means famous across America began when 200 Oglala Lakota and A.I.M. followers with rifles and shotguns occupied Wounded Knee. About 300 United States marshals, F.B.I. agents and other law-enforcement officials cordoned off the area with armored cars and heavy weapons, touching off a 10-week battle of nerves and gunfire.Amid wide news media coverage, the significance of the battlefield was not lost on many Americans. Dee Brown’s best-selling book “Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West” (1970) had recently explored the record of massacres and atrocities against Native Americans on the expanding frontier, undermining one of the nation’s fondest myths.Proclaiming a willingness to die for their cause, Mr. Banks and Mr. Means demanded the ouster of Richard Wilson, the elected leader of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council, whom they called a corrupt white man’s stooge. The government refused. Shootings punctuated the days of stalemate, leaving wounded on both sides. Two Indians were killed, and a federal agent was shot and paralyzed.When it was over, Mr. Banks and Mr. Means were charged with assault and conspiracy. After a federal trial, with the defense raising historic and current Indian grievances, a judge dismissed the case for prosecutorial misconduct, including illegal wiretaps and evidence that had been tampered with.By then, Mr. Banks was a pre-eminent spokesman for Native Americans. He mediated armed conflicts between Indians and the authorities in various states. But his own legal troubles were not over.Charged with riot and assault with a deadly weapon for his role in the 1973 melee in Custer, he was found guilty in 1975. Facing up to 15 years in prison, he jumped bail and fled to California.With 1.4 million signatures on a petition supporting Mr. Banks, Gov. Jerry Brown granted him asylum in 1976, rejecting extradition to South Dakota by saying his life might be in danger if he were sent back. Mr. Banks later became chancellor of Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl University, a small two-year college for Indians in Davis, Calif.Deprived of California sanctuary when Governor Brown was succeeded by a Republican, George Deukmejian, in early 1983, Mr. Banks found a new refuge on an Onondaga reservation near Syracuse. Federal officials said he would be arrested only if he left the reservation. But in 1984, weary of his confined life, he returned to South Dakota voluntarily and was sentenced to three years in prison.Paroled in 1985 after serving only 14 months, he moved to the Pine Ridge Reservation to work as a drug addiction and alcoholism counselor. He also turned his life around, embracing sobriety, giving talks on public service and organizing cross-country events that he called Sacred Runs, which became popular among supporters of Native Americans in later years.“We were the prophets, the messengers, the fire starters,” Mr. Banks said in an autobiography, “Ojibwa Warrior: Dennis Banks and the Rise of the American Indian Movement” (2005, with Richard Erdoes). “Wounded Knee awakened not only the conscience of all Native Americans, but also of white Americans nationwide.”Dennis James Banks was born on the Leech Lake Reservation on April 12, 1937. He never knew his father. His mother abandoned him to his grandparents.When he was 5, he was taken from his family and sent to a series of government schools for Indians that systematically denigrated his Ojibwa (Chippewa) culture, language and identity. He ran away often, until, at 17, he returned to Leech Lake.Unable to find work, he joined the Air Force and was stationed in Japan, where he married a Japanese woman, had a child with her and went absent without leave. Arrested and returned to the United States, he never saw his wife or child again. After being discharged, he moved to Minneapolis, drifted into crime, was arrested in a burglary and went to jail for two and a half years.Released in 1968, he founded the American Indian Movement with an Ojibwa he had met in prison, Clyde Bellecourt, and others to fight the oppression and endemic poverty of Native Americans. He became chairman and national director as the group, based in Minneapolis, forged alliances and grew rapidly. After two years it said it had 25,000 members.Within a year A.I.M., with its flair for guerrilla tactics, joined a lengthy occupation of Alcatraz Island, the former federal prison site in San Francisco Bay.After his fugitive years, Mr. Banks had a modest movie career. He had roles in Franc Roddam’s “War Party” (1988), Michael Apted’s “Thunderheart” (1992), Michael Mann’s “The Last of the Mohicans” (1992, with Russell Means), and Georgina Lightning’s “Older Than America” (2008), which explored the devastating effects of Indian boarding schools like those Mr. Banks had been forced to attend.Mr. Banks also appeared in documentaries: “We Shall Remain, Part V: Wounded Knee” (2009), a Ric Burns “American Experience” television film directed by Stanley Nelson; “A Good Day to Die” (2010), directed by David Mueller and Lynn Salt; and “Nowa Cumig: The Drum Will Never Stop” (2011), directed by Marie-Michele Jasmin-Belisle.Besides his wife and child in Japan, Mr. Banks had many children with other women. In addition to Ms. Banks Rama, he is survived by 19 children, 11 with the surname Banks: Janice, Darla, Deanna, Dennis, Red Elk, Tatanka, Minoh, Tokala, Tiopa, Tacanunpa and Arrow. The others are Glenda Roberts, Beverly Baribeau, Kevin Strong, D. J. Nelson-Banks, Bryan Graves, and Pearl, Denise and Kawlija Blanchard. Mr. Banks is also survived by more than 100 grandchildren, Ms. Banks Rama said.Mr. Banks was the 2016 vice presidential nominee of the California Peace and Freedom Party, which identified itself as socialist and feminist. The party’s presidential candidate was Gloria La Riva. As a single-state ticket, they won 66,000 votes.In recent years, Mr. Banks lived with some of his children in Kentucky and Minnesota. He was an honorary trustee of the Leech Lake Tribal College, a two-year public institution in Cass Lake, Minn. Mr. Means, who also appeared in movies and wrote a memoir, died on the Pine Ridge Reservation in 2012 at age 72.In 1990, both men joined a ceremony at the Pine Ridge Reservation commemorating the centenary of the Wounded Knee massacre.“Maybe we opened up some eyes, opened some doors,” Mr. Banks told The Los Angeles Times. “And it was at least an educational process here. Fifteen years ago, there was no newspaper here, no radio station. Now there’s more community control over education.”
After Spacey Accusation, Netflix Announces End of ‘House of Cards’ The day after Kevin Spacey apologized following an accusation that he made a sexual advance on a 14-year-old boy in the 1980s, Netflix announced that the next season of his show “House of Cards” would be its last.Netflix and Media Rights Capital, the studio behind the show, said in a statement Monday they were “deeply troubled by last night’s news concerning Kevin Spacey.”“Executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported,” the statement said. “As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time.”A Netflix spokeswoman said the decision to make the sixth season the show’s last had been made months ago. Those episodes are scheduled to be released in 2018.Mr. Spacey has played the lead character in “House of Cards” since it debuted in 2013, starring alongside Robin Wright and also serving as an executive producer. The political thriller was a breakthrough for Netflix, just as it was starting its efforts into producing original programming and offering subscribers an opportunity to watch an entire season of a new series in one fell swoop. Mr. Spacey’s over-the-top performance as Frank Underwood has earned him five Emmy Award nominations.The International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which presents the International Emmy Awards, announced on Monday that it would not honor Mr. Spacey with a founders award, which was to be bestowed at the International Emmy Awards Gala on Nov. 20.On Sunday night, BuzzFeed published an article in which the actor Anthony Rapp accused Mr. Spacey of making a sexual advance toward him when he was 14 and Mr. Spacey was in his mid-20s.Mr. Spacey released an apology shortly after. He said he did not recall the episode but apologized for his “deeply inappropriate drunken behavior” and that the allegation “has encouraged me to address other things about my life.”Beau Willimon, a creator on “House of Cards” who left the series in 2016, said earlier on Monday that he found Mr. Rapp’s allegations “deeply troubling.”“During the time I worked with Kevin Spacey on ‘House of Cards’ I neither witnessed nor was aware of any inappropriate behavior on set or off,” he said in a statement he posted on Twitter. “That said, I take reports of such behavior seriously, and this is no exception. I feel for Mr. Rapp and I support his courage.”
Stephen Colbert Can Hardly Contain His Excitement About the Indictments Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com.Late-night hosts on Monday seized upon a bombshell story that they had been expecting, in some form or another, for weeks. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, announced charges against the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and two other erstwhile members of President Trump’s team.“It really doesn’t look good. Twelve counts, including ‘conspiracy against the United States.’ I don’t even know what that means, but it just sounds bad,” Trevor Noah said.Stephen Colbert could hardly control his excitement.And Jimmy Fallon thinks we might start seeing a lot less of Mr. Trump’s children.Mr. Colbert zeroed in on the least well-known person to be implicated in the indictments: the former Trump adviser George Papadopoulos, who has already pleaded guilty and is reportedly cooperating with the investigation.“The Tonight Show” imagines Mr. Trump’s presidency as one long scary movie.Shaquille O’Neal sat in for Jimmy Kimmel on Monday. “Now that I’m a late-night host I came up with a new nickname for myself,” he said. “Arsenio Tall.”Chris Matthews, the host of MSNBC’s “Hardball,” will speak to Stephen Colbert on Tuesday.Mark Hamill, who returns as Luke Skywalker in the new “Star Wars” film, “The Last Jedi,” is as much of an unapologetic geek at heart as any of his admirers.
What Experts Know About Men Who Rape In 1976, a Ph.D. candidate at Claremont Graduate University placed a rather unusual personal ad in newspapers throughout Los Angeles:He sat by his phone, skeptical that it would ring. “I didn’t think that anyone would want to respond,” said Samuel D. Smithyman, now 72 and a clinical psychologist in South Carolina.But the phone did ring. Nearly 200 times.At the other end of the line were a computer programmer who had raped his “sort of girlfriend,” a painter who had raped his acquaintance’s wife, and a school custodian who described 10 to 15 rapes as a means of getting even with “rich bastards” in Beverly Hills.By the end of the summer, Dr. Smithyman had completed 50 interviews, which became the foundation for his dissertation: “The Undetected Rapist.” What was particularly surprising to him was how normal these men sounded and how diverse their backgrounds were. He concluded that few generalizations could be made.Over the past few weeks, women across the world have recounted tales of harassment and sexual assault by posting anecdotes to social media with the hashtag #MeToo. Even just focusing on the second category, the biographies of the accused are so varied that they seem to support Dr. Smithyman’s observation.But more recent research suggests that there are some commonalities. In the decades since his paper, scientists have been gradually filling out a picture of men who commit sexual assaults.The most pronounced similarities have little to do with the traditional demographic categories, like race, class and marital status. Rather, other kinds of patterns have emerged: these men begin early, studies find. They may associate with others who also commit sexual violence. They usually deny that they have raped women even as they admit to nonconsensual sex.Clarifying these and other patterns, many researchers say, is the most realistic path toward curtailing behaviors that cause so much pain.“If you don’t really understand perpetrators, you’re never going to understand sexual violence,” said Sherry Hamby, editor of the journal Psychology of Violence. That may seem obvious, but she said she receives “10 papers on victims” for every one on perpetrators.This may be partly connected to a tendency to consider sexual assault a women’s issue even though men usually commit the crime. But finding the right subjects also has complicated the research.Early studies relied heavily on convicted rapists. This skewed the data, said Neil Malamuth, a psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has been studying sexual aggression for decades.Men in prison are often “generalists,” he said: “They would steal your television, your watch, your car. And sometimes they steal sex.”But men who commit sexual assault, and are not imprisoned because they got away with it, are often “specialists.” There is a strong chance that this is their primary criminal transgression.More recent studies tend to rely on anonymous surveys of college students and other communities, which come with legal language assuring subjects their answers cannot be used against them. The studies avoid using terms such as “rape” and “sexual assault.”Instead, they ask subjects highly specific questions about their actions and tactics. The focus of most sexual aggression research is acknowledged nonconsensual sexual behavior. In questionnaires and in follow-up interviews, subjects are surprisingly open about ignoring consent.Men who rape tend to start young, in high school or the first couple of years of college, likely crossing a line with someone they know, the research suggests.Some of these men commit one or two sexual assaults and then stop. Others — no one can yet say what portion — maintain this behavior or even pick up the pace.Antonia Abbey, a social psychologist at Wayne State University, has found that young men who expressed remorse were less likely to offend the following year, while those who blamed their victim were more likely to do it again.One repeat offender put it this way: “I felt I was repaying her for sexually arousing me.”There is a heated debate among experts about whether there is a point at which sexual assault becomes an entrenched behavior and what percentage of assaults are committed by serial predators.Most researchers agree that the line between the occasional and frequent offender is not so clear. The recent work of Kevin Swartout, a professor of psychology and public health at Georgia State University, suggests that low-frequency offenders are more common on college campuses than previously thought.“It’s a matter of degree, more like dosage,” said Mary P. Koss, a professor of public health at the University of Arizona, who is credited with coining the term “date rape.”Dosage of what? Certain factors — researchers call them “risk factors” while acknowledging that these men are nonetheless responsible for their actions — have an outsize presence among those who commit sexual assaults.Heavy drinking, perceived pressure to have sex, a belief in “rape myths” — such as the idea that no means yes — are all risk factors among men who have committed sexual assault. A peer group that uses hostile language to describe women is another one.Yet there also seem to be personal attributes that have a mediating effect on these factors. Men who are highly aroused by rape porn — another risk factor — are less likely to attempt sexual assault if they score highly on measures of empathy, Dr. Malamuth has found.Narcissism seems to work in the other direction, magnifying odds that men will commit sexual assault and rape.What about the idea that rape is about power over women? Some experts feel that research into hostile attitudes toward women supports this idea.In general, however, researchers say motives are varied and difficult to quantify.Dr. Malamuth has noticed that repeat offenders often tell similar stories of rejection in high school and of looking on as “jocks and the football players got all the attractive women.”As these once-unpopular, often narcissistic men become more successful, he suspects that “getting back at these women, having power over them, seems to have become a source of arousal.”Most subjects in these studies freely acknowledge nonconsensual sex — but that does not mean they consider it real rape. Researchers encounter this contradiction again and again.Asked “if they had penetrated against their consent,” said Dr. Koss, the subject will say yes. Asked if he did “something like rape,” the answer is almost always no.Studies of incarcerated rapists — even men who admit to keeping sex slaves in conflict zones — find a similar disconnect. It’s not that they deny sexual assault happens; it’s just that the crime is committed by the monster over there.And this is not a sign that the respondents are psychopaths, said Dr. Hamby, the journal editor. It’s a sign that they are human. “No one thinks they are a bad guy,” she said.Indeed, experts note one last trait shared by men who have raped: they do not believe they are the problem.
A Lesson From the Biggest Losers: Exercise Keeps Off the Weight It is a question that plagues all who struggle with weight: Why do some of us manage to keep off lost pounds, while others regain them?Now, a study of 14 participants from the “Biggest Loser” television show provides an answer: physical activity — and much more of it than public health guidelines suggest.On average, those who managed to maintain a significant weight loss had 80 minutes a day of moderate activity, like walking, or 35 minutes a day of vigorous exercise, like running.The researchers conducting the new study did not distinguish between purposeful exercise, like going to the gym and working out, and exercise done over the course of the day, like walking to work or taking the stairs.Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, by comparison, call for at least 150 minutes a week of moderate exercise, or 75 minutes a week of vigorous exercise for healthy adults.The study was published on Tuesday in the journal Obesity. The lead author, Kevin Hall, chief of the Integrative Physiology Section at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and his colleagues also presented their work at the Obesity Society’s annual meeting.Although the study is very small and must be replicated, Dr. Hall said, it is the first to assess obese people years after they lost weight with state-of-the-art methods to measure the calories they had consumed and the amount of exercise they had done.The researchers did their measurements when the contestants were chosen, and again at six weeks, thirty weeks and six years after the contest began.“The findings here are important,” said Rena Wing, a psychiatry professor at Brown University and a founder of the National Weight Control Registry, which includes more than 10,000 people.The food eaten “is the key determinant of initial weight loss. And physical activity is the key to maintenance,” she said.The study also helps explain why that might be. One consequence of weight loss among the Biggest Loser participants was a greatly slowed metabolism.The subjects were burning an average of 500 fewer calories a day than would be expected, Dr. Hall and his colleagues found. In essence, their bodies were fighting against weight loss.Those who kept the weight off “are countering the drop in metabolism with physical activity,” Dr. Hall said.During the initial weight loss, the equation was different. Then, the difference between how much weight “Biggest Loser” contestants lost could be explained by the number of calories they cut from their diets. The amount of exercise did not distinguish those who lost more from those who lost less.The contestants competed for six months to see who could lose the most weight. Participants followed a grueling diet and an exhausting exercise program.Contestants’ average weight at the start of the show was 329 pounds. At the end, it was 200 pounds, a 129-pound loss. But six years after the study ended, their average weight rebounded to 290 pounds, just 38 pounds less than when they started.That average, though, hid wide variations.To learn more, Dr. Hall and his colleagues divided the group of 14 into two. There were the “regainers,” the seven participants who ended up after six years weighing five pounds more on average than they had at the start.And there were the “maintainers,” the seven who maintained an average weight loss of 81 pounds.To measure the amount of calories the contestants burned, the researchers asked the subjects to drink “doubly labeled water,” in which hydrogen and oxygen atoms are at least partially replaced by stable isotopes, which have a different atomic mass.The isotopes appear in carbon dioxide exhaled by subjects, which allowed the researchers to estimate the average amount exhaled each day. The more calories burned, the more carbon dioxide exhaled.Some “Biggest Loser” contestants — including the first author, Dr. Jennifer Kerns, now an obesity specialist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Washington — said the conclusions of the new study confirmed their own experiences.Dr. Kerns, a contestant in Season 3 of the show, says she has managed to keep off 100 pounds only by tracking everything she eats and by exercising on an elliptical cross-trainer for 35 to 40 minutes a day. In addition, her job requires her to walk around the hospital seeing patients.She has learned that she cannot relax this regimen if she wants to maintain her weight. “My natural tendency is to regain,” she said.Erinn Egbert was a candidate for Season 8 of the “Biggest Loser” but ultimately did not make the cut. So she went home “to figure it out on my own.”She hired two trainers and followed a diet and exercise program while she finished her senior year at Ohio State University. She weighed 237 pounds when the show began and lost about 120 pounds.She has maintained a weight that is just eight pounds more. She does it with rigid portion control and regular, intense exercise — 45 minutes to an hour a day, Monday through Saturday, doing the Beachbody programs, a challenging combination of strength training and cardiovascular exercise.Ms. Egbert, who is 30 and lives in Lexington, Ky., says she learned the importance of working consistently to stay thin, even with a slowed metabolism.“You have got to keep at it every single day,” she said.It’s a difficult task for virtually anyone, Dr. Kerns said: “The amount of time and dedication it takes to manage one’s food intake and prioritize exercise every day can be an untenable burden for many people.”“It’s totally unfair to judge those who can’t do it,” she added.Dr. Hall agreed. “The idea that people who regain lost weight are necessarily slothful and gluttonous is an unfortunate stigmatization that is not based in fact,” he said.Danny Cahill, who is 47 and lives in Tulsa, Okla., is among those who found it increasingly difficult to keep up the sort of regimen he needed to avoid gaining weight.He won the “Biggest Loser” competition in Season 8. He weighed 430 pounds when the show began, and lost 239 of them.For the four years after the show, he exercised more than two and half hours a day and gained back just 40 pounds.Then the injuries began, forcing him to cut back his workouts to one and half hours a day. His weight crept up to 235 pounds.The next year, “my body just started breaking down,” he said. “I had a foot injury, a wrist injury. I couldn’t keep it up.” And he was exhausted.His weight went up to 300 pounds. For the past two years, his weight has remained stable at about 340 to 350 pounds, “but only because I am eating as very little as I can,” he said.“That’s the disheartening part,” Mr. Cahill said. Losing the pounds is one thing. Keeping them off?“I am still struggling with it,” he said.
When the Doctor’s Mother Has Cancer “I want you to talk to me like I’m one of your patients, not like I’m your mother.”My mom’s familiar voice came over the car’s speakers via the Bluetooth connection to my phone as I drove home. She had left a voicemail an hour earlier asking me to call her back, which was never a good sign. My mother, still working as an administrator in Rhode Island at age 74, was not the type to mince words, nor ask for a return call to discuss trivialities. I asked her what was going on.“I had a cold that wasn’t getting any better, so I went to an urgent care clinic to get some antibiotics.”I avoided the temptation to remind her that most colds were viral, and that antibiotics don’t alter their duration. Naturally, she knew that I would tell her that, and thus she didn’t mention she was going to urgent care in the first place. So it goes with mothers and sons, particularly when one of those sons is a doctor. She continued.“They took a chest X-ray, and my doctor called me the next day to tell me they found a ‘shadow’ in my left lung and that I needed to get a CT scan of my chest.”By this point I was holding my breath, bracing myself for what would come next: The beginning of every cancer story, when the seemingly innocent cough, dizziness or common cold takes a sinister turn and the unexpected replaces what was expected.“She called me this afternoon and told me I have lung cancer, and I have to schedule a biopsy.”I only vaguely processed the other cars on the road and the clouds breezing past the gray sky, the rest of the world moving on as mine suddenly stood still.“O.K.,” I said, buying time to find some of the words I had heard family members of my own patients use for reassurance. “There are still a lot of things a mass in the lungs could be, like an infection, or scar tissue. It’s not cancer yet, until a biopsy shows that it’s cancer.” So the saying in oncology goes: “Tumor is a rumor, tissue is the issue.” I continued. “You haven’t gotten a biopsy, right?”“Well, no. But my doctor seemed pretty sure this was cancer.”“It’s not cancer yet,” I said, more son than doctor, trying to convince myself as much as her.Over the next few days, I played an unfamiliar role. Rather than doctor providing information, I became the family member trying to obtain it, and also attempting to help schedule a procedure in an unfamiliar hospital many states away.My mother’s doctor faxed me the report from the CT scan, which described a lobulated mass over three centimeters long, typical of cancer. Scheduling the biopsy proved more challenging, though, and after several phone calls the best the interventional radiology department could provide was a tentative date, 10 days in the future.We entered the purgatory of waiting for a diagnosis. As those days passed, my mother formulated a number of “If this is cancer” questions: “If this is cancer, what are the next tests I will need? Will I need surgery? Chemotherapy? Can I keep working? When will we know?”Until the diagnosis was made, I could answer only in generalities, and speculate.Three days after the biopsy of the mass in her lung, the one that looked ominous as a cumulonimbus cloud on her CT scan, my phone buzzed with her message: “The test was positive. Call me, I’m home.”I never imagined that the diagnosis would arrive by text. Then again, perhaps texting allowed her, and me, some distance from the new truth that had just dawned. I ducked away from my own clinic full of cancer patients to reach her.“I just talked to my doctor. The biopsy showed cancer.” It was the first time she had used the word, and I noted again how she distanced herself from it, as if the biopsy had the cancer, not her.“Did your doctor mention what kind of cancer?” I asked. She read the unfamiliar words from the paper on which she had taken notes.“Adenocarcinoma. Consistent with pulmonary origin.” There was silence on the phone line as we both processed the information. “What is the next step?” she asked.The next step was to determine how far the cancer had spread — its stage. In this respect, lung cancer is quite different from the cancer I treat, leukemia. Leukemia doesn’t have a stage, as it appears throughout the blood and bone marrow at diagnosis. If we did try to tag a stage to leukemia, it would be stage 4 or stage 0: Either you’ve got it, or you don’t.The staging for lung cancer is predicated on the tumor’s size, whether it has spread to lymph nodes, the location of those lymph nodes, or whether it has metastasized to another organ or to the bones. This is assessed by additional scans, and often more biopsies. I explained this to her and asked whether she wanted the tests performed closer to her home in Rhode Island, or where I live and practice, in Cleveland.“What do you want?” she asked.It was hard to answer. I just wanted her better.She decided to have her staging and consultations at my hospital, and flew west the following week to begin her appointments, starting with an M.R.I. of the brain to check if the cancer had spread there, some lab tests and a PET/CT scan.Positron emission tomography or PET scans involve injection into the veins of a radionuclide “tracer” attached to glucose. Cells in the body that are active (and thus consuming glucose), such as cancer cells, accumulate the tracer and “light up” on the scan. The test can thus show both the main tumor and areas where the tumor has spread. Other cells that are active, which can occur with infection or inflammation, can also light up, though, leading to false positive results, meaning the scan shows cancer erroneously.The next day we met first with the surgeon, who showed her the M.R.I. scans on the computer screen in his clinic room. He told her that her brain was free of cancer, and that it was “young” appearing.She was thrilled with both details and visibly relaxed. “That was my biggest fear, that it had spread to my brain.”Next, he showed the PET scans. “Here’s the tumor we saw on the CT scan,” he said, pointing at a fiery, globular mass. “And here are a couple of lymph nodes in your mediastinum,” in the middle of the chest, pointing at two smaller flames where the cancer had spread.Instead of stage 1 lung cancer, meaning cancer that was confined to the initial mass and could be removed surgically, she had stage 3 and would need to receive chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Then, only if the cancer regressed, would she be eligible for surgery.It also meant the chance she would be cured had just plummeted manifold.“I want to be sure that those lymph nodes really have cancer in them,” the surgeon said as much to her as to himself as he considered the PET scan. “I’ll arrange for you to have a biopsy by a pulmonologist.”She met next with a medical oncologist, a lung cancer specialist and close friend who also coached my son’s baseball team. In the cruelest of ironies, he had recently lost his own mother to stage 4 lung cancer, and he regarded me and my mother with that special kind of empathy reserved for those who are equally embattled cancer soldiers and their caregivers. He walked us through his treatment plan and also paused as he reviewed the PET scan. “We’ll biopsy those lymph nodes before starting any of this,” he said, reinforcing what the surgeon had said.Two days later, my mother underwent the additional biopsy, and an hour after that, the pulmonologist called me.“The lymph nodes were totally clear,” he said over the phone. “No cancer. The PET scan was a false positive.”I repeated the words back to him to make sure I had heard them correctly, and then choked up as a wave of relief washed over me. She was back to stage 1, and would just need surgery. I told her the good news in the recovery area, following the biopsy.Walking from the procedure, my mother and I ran into the medical oncologist and told him the biopsy results. This man, whose own mother was denied any chance of cure for her lung cancer, was selflessly overjoyed at our good fortune. He hugged us in congratulations.“I have to wonder,” my mother asked him, “would I have been treated with chemotherapy and radiation elsewhere, based only on the PET scan results?”He nodded, grimacing. “Unfortunately, that happens a lot.”My mother underwent surgery, and has now returned to work. She had a great outcome, but she also had a strong, connected advocate, in me, and the means to travel to a specialty cancer center. I was happy for her, but the experience was discomfiting. It left me wondering how commonly cancer patients are treated inappropriately because they don’t have that same access, based on tests that aren’t always accurate.
Up Close With the Tribes of Ethiopia’s Imperiled Omo Valley “Your George W. Bush came here two years ago and not a person recognized him.”“No one?”“No one knew who he was.”“Would they have known Nelson Mandela?”“No. No one here would have seen TV. No one here thinks beyond Omo.”I was speaking with Lale Biwa, a member of the Karo people, in Ethiopia’s Omo Valley. We were surrounded by low, circular huts made from sticks, with pitched grass roofs, in his home village of Dus, on the banks of the Omo River. A woman, heavily adorned in beads and bracelets, ground sorghum on a large stone in the nearby shade. Men, some carrying AK-47s, sat in clusters. Small naked children scampered past. Goats and cattle roamed freely on the dusty flood plain. There was no electricity, no running water, no cars. Mr. Biwam, who guesses his age to be “about 40,” looked around. “It is a good place,” he said. “The people are true.”I had come to the Omo Valley with the innovative tourism entrepreneur Will Jones to get a view into the lives of some of Africa’s most traditional tribes. “I’m particularly interested in the Omo,” Mr. Jones told me. “It’s an at-risk ecosystem, with at-risk communities. But it is still a very wild place.” Mr. Jones was born in Nigeria of English parents, raised in East Africa and educated in England. “When it came time to put on a suit and go into town,” he said, “I came back to Africa.”Mr. Jones, 45, has been creating customized tours to the continent for more than 20 years. Wild Philanthropy is his latest venture — an enterprise designed to build sustainable tourism with a mutually beneficial exchange between visitors and the people and land they visit. Mr. Jones also operates the only permanent tented camp in the Omo Valley, not far from Mr. Biwa’s village.This southwestern corner of Ethiopia is home to seven primary tribes who coexist with varying degrees of peace. The land is largely dry savanna, with the Omo River cutting a nearly 475-mile-long swath down to Lake Turkana on the Kenya border. The discovery of human remains dating back nearly 2.5 million years prompted Unesco to dub the Lower Valley a World Heritage site in 1980.But today the Omo is a region on the precipice. The Ethiopian government has recently completed the third of five proposed dams upriver. The dams threaten to alter the lives of the communities that have inhabited this valley for millennium and depend on the river’s moods for survival.“This was the second year in a row that the flood crop failed,” Mr. Jones told me. “It is the only time anyone can remember that the river never rose.”The area has also fallen victim to hit-and-run tourism — people driving down from Addis Ababa, storming into villages, cameras blazing, then leaving in a cloud of dust. I encountered one such scrum at a local festival. Witnessing the feverish pursuit for documentation of “otherness” reflected back at me my own motives for being there. It is an issue every traveler to remote or indigenous regions needs to reconcile.“There is a circuit of exploitation here,” Mr. Jones told me. “It’s one of the reasons we cultivate relationships with the local people, trading with them, trying to create a mutually beneficial exchange. And it’s why we’re primarily using the river as our road. The river allows us access to villages inaccessible any other way.” In the six days we spent on the river we saw one other motorized boat — carrying supplies for an NGO downriver.With Mr. Biwa as our guide, we headed to a small village inhabited by the Hamar people. The Hamar, numbering 45,000 throughout the valley, are known to be pastoralists. The village was overflowing with cattle. As in Dus, the dwellings were simple, built of sticks and grass, and well ordered. Young men tended cattle while a woman skinned and butchered a goat with the help of her toddler, who hung pieces of the animal on a fence beside an AK-47 and a belt of ammo.“The AK-47 has replaced the spear,” Mr. Jones said.Mr. Biwa nodded. “As long as you have AK, you are respected,” he said. “Your family feels safe and proud. Someone with no AK, people look down on them. If you do not have AK your family will go to someone who does.”They were American-made, I was told, gathered during the war in neighboring Sudan.But they are not cheap,” Mr. Biwa said.“How much do they cost?” I asked.“Five cows,” he said.Beside firearms, I witnessed few other accommodations to the contemporary world in the Omo. Yet for a place so far off the grid, news traveled fast throughout the valley. While in the Hamar village we heard word of a nearby bull-jumping ceremony. The bull jump is a ritual initiation to manhood for both the Hamar and Karo communities. We headed east.At the end of a long, deeply rutted road we came upon a dusty village in the midst of a celebration. Old men and women gathered in the shade. Young men painted their faces red and white. Young women were draped in skirts and wore large bells wrapped around their calves. Their hair was ornately done in rings caked with ochre-colored mud. Each carried a small horn and blew it incessantly.When one young woman turned away from me I noticed fresh welts on her bare back, dripping blood; she seemed unaware and continued to dance. Then I saw her approach a young man, stand close in front of him, and blow her horn in his face. She began to jump up and down, her bells clanging, her horn blaring. The young man bent to the ground and picked up a long switch and raised it over his head. The woman blew her horn more insistently, then suddenly stopped. She stared at the young man. He struck her with the whip, which snapped around her body and lashed across her back with a sharp cracking sound. She did not flinch. She lifted her horn, blew it in his face and danced away, fresh blood rising on her back. The same performance was repeated again and again by many of the young women. Their backs were covered in old scars and new welts, yet none of them displayed any outward signs of pain.As the sun was setting, a dozen bulls were led to a clearing and aligned flank to flank. The women clustered together and began jumping, their bells ringing out, their horns blasting. Others began to chant. Suddenly a naked young man leapt up on the back of the first bull and raced across the spine of each. He jumped down after the last bull, but then he was up again, racing across their backs in the other direction. He repeated the back-and-forth exercise three times. If he fell it would be a disgrace he would carry for life, Mr. Biwa had warned me. But the youth never faltered — the next morning he would awake a man, able to sit among the elders.The women continued to blow their horns and the celebration continued on into the night. We drove away under a moonless sky, the Southern Cross hanging low, silence filling our car.The next morning we headed up river to a small village of the Nyangatom people. Relations between Karo and Nyangatom have long been strained. Intertribal conflicts over cattle rustling and grazing land have kept the valley bristling with internal strife for decades, passed down from generation to generation, Mr. Biwa said.“Where we are going, this was our land until 15 years ago,” Mr. Biwa said as he throttled our engine through the brown water. “The Nyangatom are fierce fighters. They pushed us across the river. Our women tell us we are weak. Not just with their words. They dance — in front of everyone. It is a shame we wear.”We passed large crocodiles cooling themselves on the muddy banks, their jaws resting open. Black-and-white colobus monkeys leapt from branches of fig trees. A dugout canoe sat unattended on the riverbank. A Goliath heron lumbered into the air.In time the heavy foliage lining the river thinned, then grew sparse. Thirty-foot cliffs began to rise up and the landscape turned parched. Ahead, on the west bank, bony cattle were drinking from the river, kicking a choking dust high into the sky and across the sun, casting everything in an eerie patina. Atop the cliff, two men stood sentry. One had an AK-47 slung from his shoulder; the other wore what in a more urban setting might have been called a hipster hat. The tribes wore a mishmash of clothing — brightly colored traditional wraps, animal skins and adornments, mixed freely with Chelsea football jerseys, rakish caps and fatigue shorts — creating an all too apt picture of Africa’s disparate influences, all vying for dominance.The men on the cliff greeted us with stares, and we set out across the arid land. Distant hills of Kenya were visible to the south. Three young girls with water jugs balancing on their heads silently caught up with us. One carried the designs of scarification — small, raised scars created by rubbing charcoal in deliberately administered cuts, causing the skin to welt in intricate patterns. They made this two-mile walk to and from the river twice daily — in Africa carrying water is women’s work.At the outskirts of the village, a half-dozen expressionless men loitered. The tallest sported a vaguely military-looking beret, worn at a jaunty angle, and an AK-47. The rest held long sticks. Some wore rubber sandals made from scavenged truck ties; the others were barefoot.Many Nyangatom are seminomadic and this village appeared haphazardly thrown together, as if built in a rush, without care. There was no central meeting area, no sense of organization. Children did not rush to greet us. We huddled with the men in the scant shade of a scraggly date tree. Cigarettes were passed around and smoked.In time, more than a dozen women emerged from the honeycomb-shaped dwellings that looked as if they could neither contain nor shelter life. One old woman began to chant, then just as suddenly stopped. All wore heavy ropes of beaded necklaces piled high and were wrapped from the waist in once colorful cloth, and several held small children. Fatigue hung in the blistering heat. It would have been difficult to imagine daily life clinging closer to the edge of existence.“The cradle of mankind is no Garden of Eden,” Mr. Jones said softly as we tracked back cross the barren land to the boat.Back down the river, the mood was more celebratory — a ceremony was underway in Dus. Two hundred men from Mr. Biwa’s Karo community were gathering in a large semicircle on a bluff above the river. Seating was arranged from the youngest to the most senior elder. I was offered a spot in the dirt much too far along the timeline for my liking.A bull was being roasted over an open fire in the center of the gathering. Three men with machetes hacked the animal to pieces. Chunks of meat and fat, clinging to large bones, were deposited onto small beds of leaves before the assembled. A part of the animal I couldn’t identify was dropped in front of me. The old man beside me with heavily pierced ears and a pointed stick protruding below his lower lip offered me his knife. He watched as I sliced into the mysterious blob, then grinned as I put it in my mouth. Just beyond the circle a dozen hooded vultures gathered.When the entire animal had been consumed, one of the elders got up and began to speak.“He is making a prayer for the river to rise,” Mr. Biwa told me.“Don’t they know about the dam?” I asked.“It is a difficult thing to understand,” he said.The elder kept talking as Mr. Biwa translated. “And now is a prayer for rain. For the women and children. A prayer that all bad feelings be carried off across the river.” After each invocation the assembled replied in a deep, guttural moan.Finally, the three men who had carved the bull sliced open the only remaining part of the animal. They reached in and produced globs of warm dung and dispersed them. Each man began to spread the excrement over his legs and across his chest in a commitment to protect those they love.Afterward, I slipped away. But hours later, in the dusk, I walked back alone from our camp and entered the village again. As was usually the case, a small child was the first to greet me. The light was fading quickly, as it does near the Equator. A group of men huddled near the Parliament and Ceremony House, but otherwise the village was quiet. The small boy shadowed me and I began to hear a loose kind of chanting. I turned toward the sound. There was a soft breeze in the gloaming; the heat was finally off the day. Then the unmistakable register of an AK-47 rang out.I leapt into the air. My head snapped in all directions, looking for the origin of the gunfire. Was I going to be shot as an intruder in the night? My young companion laughed at me. He looked directly up into the sky, indicating the direction of the shot. I tried to smile, and, more slowly now, continued toward the sound of the crowd. My small friend reached up and took my hand. The voices became more insistent. It was nearly dark. Then I heard it again — this time, a rapid barrage of gunfire. Then another. The boy smiled in reassurance. I dropped his hand and beat it back to the campsite.The next morning, as we loaded the boat for our trip farther downriver, I learned that a village elder had died suddenly and the gunfire had been part of the mourning process.We set out before the heat of the day. For seven hours heavy bush lined the banks. Occasionally children splashed in the crocodile-infested water and small villages were visible through the foliage. Baboons scampered up the steep banks. A rare Pel’s fishing owl swept overhead. At the dire river outpost of Omorate, we had our passports inspected, paid the local graft and carried on.“It’s a bit of a no man’s land from here to Lake Turkana,” Mr. Jones told me.The heavy bush yielded to a more open flood plane. Large villages of the Daasanach people, whom we had come to see, began to line the river. These villages differed from others we had seen in the bizarre-seeming platforms, 10 feet off the ground, that had been constructed to store and protect the sorghum crop from the annual flooding — flooding now in jeopardy because of the damming upriver.We set up camp on a high bank. The local villagers assumed free run of our site and we were absorbed into daily life. Dugout canoes, listing and overfull with people, were constantly crossing and recrossing the river. Voices carried back and forth across the water long after dark.On an excursion farther downstream, the river began to splinter. Dusty land gave way to the high grass of the delta. Soon pelicans swarmed, then Lake Turkana was upon us. After the confines of life on the river, the expanse of the inland sea was daunting.Here too, the environment is threatened. “It’s said Turkana could drop 20 feet with the dam,” Mr. Jones said. “The effect on the delta would be anyone’s guess.”From fishermen at Turkana we learned that not far upstream, numerous Daasanach communities had begun to gather for a Dimi ceremony. They had come from miles away for an event that happens only every few years and lasts several weeks — culminating in the act of female circumcision.We left the boat and were immediately confronted by two dozen teenage boys, each with a bow and arrow. After an initial standoff, they happily showed us the sharp tips of their weapons. We carried on across land littered with the bones of what I assumed to be cattle, through heat so intense it was difficult to breathe. The earth shimmered and huts began to materialize on the horizon.The Dimi gathering was in the early stages; only a handful of families had arrived. Outside the temporary huts were poles hung with leopard skin cloaks and ostrich plume hats for men, and colobus monkey capes for women. The skin of several people who came to greet us was already painted yellow in preparation for the dancing that would accompany the coming ceremony.Back by the boat I encountered a man with his entire chest and stomach covered in the well-ordered markings of scarification.“This is to indicate that he has killed in battle,” Mr. Biwa explained.The man glared at me. When I extended my hand to shake his, he broke into a toothsome grin.On our last evening, the sun was hazy near the western horizon over Sudan. I walked into the village behind our site, and then kept walking to the next village, and the next. Children began to follow. Soon their numbers were more than a hundred, the bolder ones shook hands, some touched my hair — then ran away giggling. Eventually I began to chase them — the boogeyman to their delighted screams — as the sun fell.On the way back, on the outskirts of our campsite, I came upon an old man setting fire to a dead tree near a clearing. In the morning I told Mr. Biwa what I had seen.“It was a prayer,” he said. “A prayer for the river to rise.”We climbed into our boat and headed back upstream on a river that was unlikely to do so.
For National Parks, a Proposal to Increase Visitor Fees Fees at 17 popular national parks may soon be rising sharply. On Oct. 24, the National Park Service announced a proposal to begin charging higher peak-season fees for five months per year at some of the country’s most beloved parks, including Yosemite National Park, Yellowstone and Joshua Tree National Park.The park service said that the increase in funds would be used to address maintenance issues that affect the visitor experience, such as roads, campgrounds and bathrooms.Under the proposal, entry fees at 17 parks during the peak season in 2018 would increase to $70 for noncommercial vehicles, $50 for motorcycles and $30 for pedestrians or cyclists. By comparison, in 2017 the entrance fees at Grand Canyon National Park are: $30 per vehicle, $25 per motorcycle and $15 for visitors on foot or bike. An increase in fees is also proposed for commercial tour operators, while the cost of the annual pass, with access to all national parks, would remain at $80.The proposed hike in peak season fees is similar to surge pricing, popularized by Uber, when high demand results in higher prices. The increased fees would begin as soon as Jan. 1, 2018 for Joshua Tree National Park; May 1, 2018 for 12 parks, including Glacier National Park and Olympic National Park; and June 1, 2018 for four parks, including Acadia National Park and Rocky Mountain National Park.The 17 parks included in the peak season proposal “are the top revenue parks,” according to the National Park Service. In a document released by the park service detailing the fee increases, it is noted that these parks “collect 70 percent of the total of all entrance fees throughout the country.” Out of the 417 sites run by the park service, 118 currently charge entry fees (the majority offer free entry). Funds from fee-charging parks support others with free entry; according to the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act, “80 percent of an entrance fee remains in the park where it is collected. The other 20 percent is spent on projects in other national parks.”Recreational visits to national parks have risen steadily in recent years. The park service reported more than 330 million visits in 2016 — in 2000, the number was 286 million visits. An increase in visitors and aging infrastructure both contributed to a backlog of maintenance projects in the parks. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said in a statement, “The infrastructure of our national parks is aging and in need of renovation and restoration.” The park service said that the proposed peak season fees would increase revenue by $70 million, a 34 percent increase. Yet while it is generally agreed that national park infrastructure needs maintenance, it is not agreed where those funds should originate.In reaction to the proposal, Theresa Pierno, the chief executive of the nonpartisan National Parks Conservation Association, spoke out in a statement on the group’s website. “We should not increase fees to such a degree as to make these places – protected for all Americans to experience – unaffordable for some families to visit,” she said. “The solution to our parks’ repair needs cannot and should not be largely shouldered by its visitors.”The National Park Service is open to comments from the public regarding the peak season fees proposal via their website, through Nov. 23.An increase in fees at national parks has been a recent trend. In August 2017, the cost of a lifetime senior pass was raised to $80 from $10 (the cost had been $10 since 1994). In January 2017, entry fees at Joshua Tree National Park were raised to $25 per vehicle from $20.Outside of the peak season fees, individual national parks have released proposals for increased entry fees in 2018. Proposals for modest increases include Great Falls in Maryland and Virginia, to $15 from $10 per vehicle. Other parks announced new rates starting in 2018, including Gulf Islands National Seashore, where the cost of entry for a private vehicle is being raised to $20 from $15.Price increases aren’t limited to entry fees. In January 2017, fees for group picnic areas in Washington, D.C.- area national parks rose significantly. At Fort Dupont Park in Washington, fees increased to $65 from $45 for a half-day group picnic site. In Fort Washington Park in Maryland, group picnic area rates increased to $75 per day from $25.The cost of camping is also expected to rise. A proposal from Guadalupe Mountains National Park in Texas includes an increase to $15 from $8 per night for camping in a tent or R.V. A similar proposal from Ozark National Scenic Riverways in Missouri would increase the nightly cost of backcountry campsites to $10 from $5, and the cost of cave tours to $10 from $5. A proposal from the Natural Bridges National Monument in Utah would increase camping fees to $15 from $10 during the period of March 1 to Oct. 31 each year.Travelers seeking value in the national parks may want to investigate hotel packages, especially during the off-season. Tenaya Lodge in Yosemite offers “hot dates” specials through December starting at $149 per night (rates start at $361 in July). At the Old Faithful Snow Lodge in Yellowstone, winter 2017/2018 rates are as low as $151 per night for a frontier cabin.In 2017, the National Park Service offered free entry on several holidays, including Martin Luther King Jr. Day (Jan. 16), Presidents’ Day (Feb. 20), weekends of National Park Week (April 15 to 16 and April 22 to 23), National Park Service Birthday (Aug. 25), National Public Lands Day (Sept. 30) and Veterans Day weekend (Nov. 11 to 12).
Drinks at High-End Hotel Bars — Hold the Booze Renowned hotel bars — the American Bar at the Savoy Hotel in London, for example, or Bemelmans Bar at the Carlyle in New York — are often well-regarded for their innovative cocktails. Today, creative nonalcoholic concoctions are catching on — most notably in London, Paris, New York and Los Angeles. Just don’t call them mocktails.“I consider our nonalcohol cocktails to be as complex and as important as our ones with alcohol and refer to them simply as cocktails,” said Ryan Chetiyawardana, the founder and owner of Dandelyan, at Mondrian London at Sea Containers hotel,which offers four nonalcoholic drinks. “Mocktails, on the other hand, have a negative connotation. They tend to be overly sweet and an afterthought at bars.”There’s the Bradsell, for example: a combination of cold-brew coffee, malt caramel and chai spices such as cinnamon and ginger. Another option is the Apple Sourz-Less: The base is a nonalcoholic distilled spirit called Seedlip Garden, a blend of peas, hay, spearmint, hops, rosemary and thyme; it also includes fresh peas, pressed apples, rye flakes and capillaire syrup (a mix of fern, pine and orange blossom).The bar sells an average of 50 to 100 nonalcoholic cocktails a day, and this number is only growing, according to Mr. Chetiyawardana. “The people ordering them aren’t necessarily teetotalers,” he said. “They’re often drinkers who want to take a night off from alcohol but still want to go out and socialize.”The American Bar, at the Savoy, offers five nonalcoholic cocktails, and all use another Seedlip product called Seedlip Spice, a blend of allspice berries, cardamom, oak and lemon and grapefruit peels. One example, which they refer to as the Art Deco, also includes citric acid, eucalyptus, peppermint syrup and soda water.“We’re open all day and were seeing that our customers increasingly didn’t want to drink alcohol midday, so I tried to give them some equally appealing alternatives,” said Erik Lorincz, the American Bar’s head bartender.Generally, these nonalcoholic drinks are less pricey than regular cocktails. At the American Bar, for example, prices for alcoholic cocktails start at £18 (about $24) each the nonalcoholic ones are £11.50. At Bemelmans, the difference is even more stark: nonalcoholic options are $12, compared with $21 to $26 for cocktails.Mr. Lorincz and several other hotel bartenders said that Seedlip, a relatively new London-based brand, has inspired them to pay more attention to their virgin cocktails because the two variations of the spirit are made with flavorful, high-quality ingredients and match the sophistication of a top-shelf liquor.In addition to Dandelyan and the American Bar, Seedlip cocktails are available at almost 100 notable hotel bars, including the Rivoli Bar at the Ritz London, the Nomad Bar at the Nomad Hotel in New York, Le Bar at Four Seasons Hotel George V in Paris and the Walker Inn at the Hotel Normandie in Los Angeles.Seedlip’s founder, Ben Branson, said that he created the spirits because he doesn’t imbibe but likes spending time in vibrant bars. “I love the bar scene, and I often had a hard time finding a drink to enjoy at many of the bars I went to,” he said.Well-made nonalcoholic cocktails impart the same feeling of relaxation as ones with alcohol, said Philip Duff, the education director for the New Orleans festival Tales of the Cocktail. “An artistic drink is an artistic drink whether it has alcohol in it or not, and both will chill you out,” he said. Hotel bars are the ideal setting for serving virgin drinks, he said, because compared with other bars, they tend to have bigger spending budgets and access to more ingredients, which the bartenders can use to craft creative drinks.In addition to an expansive list of alcoholic cocktails, the Le Bar du Plaza Athenne, at the Plaza Athénée in Paris, has a “Nice Guys” no-alcohol menu with four choices, including the Mister Ginger, a combination of fresh mint, ginger ale, simple syrup and soda water.And in New York City, Bemelmans Bar, at the Carlyle, has a seasonal nonalcoholic cocktail menu. Currently on offer is the Ananas Cooler, made of pineapple juice, ginger beer, muddled mint and agave nectar. Served over ice in a tall beer glass and garnished with candied ginger, the drink is now a best-seller at Bemelmans, according to Javier Martinez, the bar’s manager.“We may be known for our martinis and Manhattans, but the virgin drinks have been a winner for us and are fun for me to create,” he said. Mr. Martinez is so excited by the prospect of nonalcoholic cocktails, he said, that right now, in fall, he’s already experimenting with combinations for next spring.
Vivian Maier, Through a Clearer Lens No one would find the prospect of posthumous fame more appalling than the photographer Vivian Maier. In life, she fanatically concealed her traces: She liked strong bolts on her doors, fake names (she had at least three in rotation) and what seemed to be a spurious French accent. She rarely discussed or shared her work. Many assumed she was homeless.“I’m sort of a spy,” she’d tell people. “I’m the mystery woman.”She died in a nursing home in 2009, at 83, slipping away as anonymously as she’d lived. Her story would have ended there — but she had left riches in her wake.Among Maier’s possessions were more than 100,000 negatives — a startling body of work imbued with the humanism of Robert Frank and Lisette Model but a mischief all its own. From the 1950s, she had been photographing city life with greedy intensity, capturing vagrants passed out on the Bowery; the carcasses of the Chicago stockyards; Lena Horne, spotted on the street, on a bright autumn day — and, above all, herself. She couldn’t pass a reflective surface — a shop window, a mirror or any shiny piece of metal — without snapping a selfie. In photo after photo, she stares directly at you: a rangy woman with a deadpan expression, wearing a man’s shirt and shoes. Almost immediately upon discovery of her work, she was heralded as one of the 20th century’s great photographers.The Maier myth followed. She became the “nanny photographer,” the secretive self-taught genius who tramped around town with a Rolleiflex camera around her neck and her young charges in tow. The eBay enthusiasts who snatched up her negatives at auction with the hopes of reselling them became heroes for saving her from obscurity. One, a real estate agent named John Maloof, bought the bulk of her estate for $400 and made it his mission to share her work with the world. He has published books of her photographs, arranged exhibitions, and co-written and co-directed a documentary, “Finding Vivian Maier” (2013), that was nominated for an Academy Award.But stories — like snapshots — are shaped by people, and for particular purposes. There’s always an angle. A new biography, “Vivian Maier: A Photographer’s Life and Afterlife,” by Pamela Bannos, strives to rescue Maier all over again, this time from the men who promulgated the Maier myth and profited off her work; chiefly Maloof, who controlled her copyright for a time. After a legal battle — “the Vivian Mire,” one critic called it — her estate passed into a trust last year, where it will be held for possible heirs and eventually released into the public domain.The book braids together three strands: a brisk, rather generic history of American photography; a biography of Maier; and a withering account of how the artist has been represented since her death. “My goal was always to recognize and give Maier agency within her own story,” Bannos writes. She tries to dislodge the portrayal of Maier as a mysterious, freakish figure, and to see a person where others have seen mostly pathology: her hoarding and possible paranoia.Bannos makes the case that Maier lived a much larger, more varied life than assumed. This famous recluse once took a five-month trip around the world as well as a subarctic train expedition, both times traveling with just her camera for company. As for her notorious secrecy, it served a purpose, at least in the beginning. Her parents were frantic dissemblers who struggled to conceal scandals of illegitimacy, abandonment and institutionalization. Of course Maier was wary about sharing her personal details, Bannos reasons: Who would hire a nanny with such a sordid family life?Nor should we be so struck that Maier never wanted to show her work to anyone. Sharing comes easily, too easily, to us. Not so for Maier, who told a friend that “if she had not kept her images secret, people would have stolen or misused them” — how prophetic that now seems. And her compulsive photographing prefigured our own relationship with our phones, Bannos says, our own desire to constantly document our lives.In this way, almost point by point, Bannos refutes how Maier has been marketed. And she looks at how it has benefited Maloof et al. to present Maier as a strange, incapable wraith, how it made them look all the more heroic, and allowed them to cavalierly overlook her absolute unwillingness to to show her work publicly.In a strange coincidence, Bannos reports, 21 years after Maier lived on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, where she cared for the dark-haired girl who often appears in her photos, Susan Sontag would move into the penthouse of the very same building and begin the essays in “On Photography.” “Photographs alter and enlarge our notions of what is worth looking at and what we have a right to observe,” Sontag wrote in the opening pages of that book. “They are a grammar and, even more importantly, an ethics of seeing. Finally, the most grandiose result of the photographic enterprise is to give us the sense that we can hold the whole world in our heads.”Biographies and documentaries can tempt us the same way. They can offer the fantasy of absolute knowledge, absolute possession (perhaps this is how Maloof went astray). The achievement of Bannos’s intelligent, irritable self-reflexive study is in its restraint. She unseats the ghost and restores to us the woman — but in her own words and images, and without psychologizing. It’s a portrait as direct as any of Maier’s, and what a distinct pleasure it is to meet her gaze again.
‘Poet in Spain’ Offers New Translations of Lorca’s Soulful Work The poet and playwright Federico García Lorca is, after Cervantes, the most commanding figure in Spain’s literature. He died young, executed at 38 by nationalist forces at the start of the Spanish Civil War. This early death has rendered him a permanent political and cultural object of desire.During his lifetime Lorca feared what he called “stupid fame.” It’s hard to say what he would make of the flourishing industry of works (ballets, operas, films, novels, pop songs, poems) that reference and adapt his life and work.Lorca’s body was never found. This hasn’t stopped artists from figuratively pickpocketing it, hoping to nick a bit of his gravitas and spirit, and to import tragic frissons by association. His work is less read today than it is projected upon.Lorca was a great explicator of duende, the idea that an artwork should brim with authenticity and death-awareness and skin-prickling and foot-stamping awe and soul.He evoked duende perhaps most fully in his “Gypsy Ballads,” published in 1928. It’s a canonical book in Spain. Here was a highly cultivated poet reworking Andalusian folk culture and myth. The high-low effect was startling. It was as if Robert Lowell had made a murderous little book that drew its inspiration from Harry Smith’s “Anthology of American Folk Music.”The poet and translator Sarah Arvio is here now with “Poet in Spain,” a new translation of Lorca’s poems into English. It is the first major undertaking of its kind since “Collected Poems: A Bilingual Edition” (1991), the work of several translators and edited by Christopher Maurer.Unlike Maurer, Arvio omits Lorca’s intemperate and political and Whitman-inflected New York poems, written after he visited the city in 1929 and 1930. (These were published after his death under the title “Poet in New York.”) She focuses instead entirely on what she calls his “moonlit earthbound Spanish poems.”About Lorca’s New York versus his Spanish poems, Arvio writes, “To my ear, these voices are so different they could almost be the voices of two different poets.” The crucial word here is “almost.” The absence of these vital poems immediately renders Arvio’s book less necessary than Maurer’s in terms of seeing this complicated poet whole.There are consolations. Arvio is a supple translator, and she has delivered a personal book. She has felt free to shift Lorca’s poems around in sequence, as he himself often did when putting together his books. Most notably she has shorn the poems of punctuation, as Lorca sometimes did in his drafts.The spare effect can be riveting. Take this snippet of “Dreamwalking Ballad”:At other moments, the punctuation is missed. You feel Lorca has been tamped down. His poem “Cazador” (“Hunter”), for example, begins with these words: “¡Alto pinar!” Arvio translates this, with a vast diminution in energy, as “High grove of pines.”Lorca wrote in an exclamatory style that gave his work a flamenco brashness. Witness the first stanza of “Árboles” (“Trees”) from 1919:Arvio renders this in telegraphic yet somewhat lobotomized fashion:At other moments, Arvio’s translations are both less accurate and less felicitous than those in Maurer’s edition. The opening lines of “Reyerta” (“Brawl” or “Feud”), for example, read this way: “En la mitad del barranco / las navajas de Albacete, / bellas de sangre contraria, / relucen como los peces.”Arvio gives us this translation: “Halfway down the gully / the blades from Albacete / glisten like fishes / flush with fighting blood.”In Maurer’s book, it is: “Halfway down the gorge / knives of Albacete, / beautiful with enemy blood, / shine like fish.”Beautiful with enemy blood. That isn’t just a gorgeous phrase, ripe with meaning, but it comports more exactly with Lorca’s Spanish.The poems in this book include not only “Gypsy Ballads,” but the “Dark Love Sonnets,” with their death-haunted homoeroticism, and poems about the deadly goring of Lorca’s friend the bullfighter Ignacio Sánchez Mejías, among others.Lorca’s poems from Spain are a poetry of dreams and journeys and glimpses from balconies, of sunbaked meadows and realms of erotic yearning. He went to the well often for the same elemental imagery: the sea, the wind, the moon, flowers and trees. His mind worked feverishly enough to induce hallucinations.He completed 13 plays and nine books of verse between 1917 and 1936. This book includes one of those plays, a rich and gripping retranslation of “Blood Wedding,” written in 1932. It’s an unconventional choice to print it in a book of poems, but Arvio argues and then demonstrates that the language in it is of a piece with Lorca’s blood-warm verse.The poet Ted Hughes, who once translated “Blood Wedding,” observed that “Lorca cannot be Englished.” Perhaps. But his life and work offer mysteries we’re still profitably untangling.
Hilde Lysiak, Reporter, Author, 10-Year-Old The first book in the “Hilde Cracks the Case” series opens with 9-year-old Hilde Lysiak outside her local police station in the town of Selinsgrove, Pa., following up on a tip about a break-in on Orange Street. The on-duty officer refuses to divulge any information, but if she’s going to break the story in her newspaper, The Orange Street News, she has to investigate using six basic reporting questions: Who? What? Where? When? Why? How?“In the first chapter, Hilde is doing the exact same thing I did in real life,” said Ms. Lysiak, the now 10-year-old reporter upon whom the book is based. She visited The Times recently, proudly rocking peach-colored socks featuring racoons eating doughnuts.“Hero Dog” is the first of six books in a series featuring Ms. Lysiak; they draw significantly from her experiences chasing the news in real-life Selinsgrove, where her parents give her a two-mile-wide stomping ground. The books, which Ms. Lysiak works on with her father, Matthew Lysiak, include definitions for terms like a “deadline” or a “press pass” and reporting tips like the six questions, which she used to write on her arm in marker so she wouldn’t forget them. The second book in the series was released on Tuesday. Ms. Lysiak’s story has also been optioned by Paramount TV and Anonymous Content for a television series.Ms. Lysiak’s experiences went viral in April 2016, when she broke a story on a local homicide. A source had tipped her on the incident a few blocks from her home, and after confirming with the police department, she immediately went to the scene, interviewing neighbors for additional information. Her on-the-ground reporting meant her article was up hours before other news outlets had even reached the scene, prompting critical comments on her website from those who thought a little girl as “cute” as she was should be playing with dolls or having tea parties instead of chasing hard news. Her story was picked up by The Washington Post and The Guardian, among other outlets.“I think a lot of adults tell their kids they can do anything, but at the end of the day don’t actually let them do anything,” she said.Growing up, Ms. Lysiak traveled around the country with her father, a former reporter for The New York Daily News, when he was on assignment. Asked what she remembers from that time, she mentions a wild turkey chase in Staten Island and a visit to an oversize Christmas tree in Pennsylvania.But her father notes that she was exposed to serious reporting early on. They spent a month in Florida after Trayvon Martin was shot and killed by George Zimmerman and went to South Carolina after the massacre at a church in Charleston.“We would have conversations, but I wish I could tell you I said, ‘Well, in journalism, here’s what we do,’” Mr. Lysiak said. Instead, Ms. Lysiak learned through exposure.The family moved from New York City to Pennsylvania when she was 6, and soon after she started covering minor family events — she broke the news to her father, for instance, that her mother planned to buy a new car — writing the articles on notecards in crayon. But she quickly realized it “wasn’t getting me anywhere” and asked her dad if he could help her start a “real” newspaper. He agreed to handle the printing and the layout if she did all the writing and reporting.She began by covering her block, then broadened to the neighborhood. Sometimes she gets stories from emailed tips, but mostly she rides around on her bike, asking people if they’ve heard of anything strange going on.Ms. Lysiak started out charging $1 for a year’s subscription and had a few dozen subscribers; now her print circulation is close to 600 — $20 for a yearlong subscription — with hundreds of thousands of online views. Ms. Lysiak uses some of this money to pay her 13-year-old sister Izzy $25 a week to be her videographer. She credits her older sibling with making her paper a multimedia operation.Ms. Lysiak is home-schooled and used to spend all her time reporting. “She’d leave in the morning, and we wouldn’t see her until the afternoon,” said Mr. Lysiak. His wife, Bridget, wanted to make sure their daughters had a contingency plan in case their passions changed. They balance out reporting with regular math, science and history lessons for Ms. Lysiak, while Izzy, who has a regular advice column in The Orange Street News and works as an actress, takes 10th-grade-level math, biology and history at the local high school. Ms. Lysiak also has two younger sisters, Juliet, 3, and Georgia, 6.“Our family’s really big on people having free time,” Mr. Lysiak said. “There’s so much homework in school these days, and we had to make the decision about whether she’d have her paper or not. And she really wanted her paper.”The Lysiaks send Hilde to camp for a few weeks every summer to make sure she gets a break from reporting, and she spends her free time making slime, which “I find great joy in,” she said.In fact, slime comes up quite a bit, to her father’s chagrin. Ms. Lysiak laments that her biking limits prevent her from riding to Walmart, where they sell inexpensive glue that is “great for slime.” And she recounts an accident in her “laboratory” — her closet — after which her parents relegated her slime-making to the outdoors. Ms. Lysiak is as serious about her reporting as she is about being a kid.“Hilde Cracks the Case” is part of the Branches line at Scholastic, a group of early chapter books geared toward children 5 to 8 years old who are newly independent readers but not yet ready for conventional chapter books. It’s the brainchild of Katie Carella, a senior editor at Scholastic; before getting into publishing, she was a teacher, and she noticed a gap in the books available to her students who were burgeoning readers.“I want to have a series that can reach every reader,” Ms. Carella said. “Kids at this level need to build their reading stamina and fluency,” and it’s important that they be allowed to “make their own reading choices.” The Branches line was first introduced in 2013, and now it includes 18 series (the 19th will be published in January), with 12 million books in circulation. “Hilde Cracks the Case” is its first mystery series.When the real Hilde’s parents left New York, they thought they were putting journalism behind them. Mr. Lysiak had become disenchanted with the industry, so he left his job at The Daily News.“When I saw her real passion, it brought my passion back,” he said, “because she does it so simply — it’s like who, what. The things that I used to go do before it got complicated.”Despite earlier criticism, people in the town definitely take her seriously now.“There are a lot of people in town that don’t like her,” Mr. Lysiak said. “ They want her writing stories about parades and promoting the town. But no, Hilde wants to report crime and scandal when she finds it.”In response to her neighbors’ wariness, Ms. Lysiak added, “It makes me think I’m a good journalist.”
What to Do When an Inebriated Stranger Stumbles Into Your Home? What would you do if you heard a noise in the night and discovered a stranger in the house? Offer him a midnight snack? A hoodie, if it’s chilly? A ride home? That’s how some residents react to a home invasion in the student-saturated neighborhoods surrounding Penn State University. True, some of them grab baseball bats and call the police, but once they realize the intruder is an inebriated undergraduate who has no idea where he is, the adrenaline rush ebbs and empathy kicks in.“I was a college kid,” reasoned David McClelland, a homeowner who confronted an uninvited guest. “I remember doing some dumb stuff.”“The mother in me came out,” is how Meredith Doran put it. A stranger came banging on her back door one frigid winter morning. Seeing his thin hoodie, she let him in, offered him crackers and water and then a ride home. “His vibe,” she explained, “was not a menacing one.”The same cannot be said of Ms. Doran’s husband, Matt Jordan, who, a couple of years earlier, had grabbed a bat to confront a student in boxer shorts and knee-high black socks who sat on their sofa with his head in his hands.“Who the hell are you?” asked Mr. Jordan, who is as physically imposing as an N.F.L. tight end.“I’m J.T.,” his visitor announced, as if his identity should have been obvious.“J.T.,” Mr. Jordan recounted, “if you don’t get out of the house now, I’m going to call the police. And he said, ‘Dude, really?’ And I said, ‘Yes, really.’”The townies have a name for these intruders: Red Bull Zombies. Before hyper-caffeinated beverages like Red Bull, students could consume only so much alcohol before passing out. Now, they’re no less addled but the stimulants keep them ambulatory, and so they blunder into the wrong houses.There are as many students as there are full-time residents in the State College area. Most locals tuck themselves away in quiet suburban enclaves. Those who dwell among the students so value their neighborhood’s historic houses, tree-lined streets and proximity to downtown and campus that they’re willing to put up with what they call the “dumb stuff.” And some positively enjoy the antic energy of their young neighbors.“There’s a pulse to the neighborhood,” said Joel Weidner, who called the police when he heard someone “thudding around” in his basement a few years back. A drunken student had crashed through a basement window. “Suburbia would be boring.”While these victims of home invasions see the humor in their experiences, they’re keenly aware that their community, like so many college towns, has a serious drinking problem. Just this year, after a night of alcohol-drenched hazing rituals, a fraternity pledge fell down a flight of stairs and later died. In response, the university has increased its oversight of the Greek system. Among new restrictions, it is reducing the number of fraternity parties with alcohol that it issues permits for, from 45 a semester to 10 (wine and beer only, and no kegs).It’s hard to know how often the Red Bull Zombies strike, because many trespasses go unreported and the ones that are called in are variously classified as criminal mischief, public drunkenness, underage drinking or disorderly conduct. The State College police chief, John Gardner, guesses that 5 to 10 student invasions occur a year. There’s potential for harm, of course, for residents who let their guard down as well as for invaders. In 2014 in Sterling, Va., an inebriated teenager was shot and killed when he stumbled into a neighbor’s house.Sometimes the residents haven’t locked up; sometimes the uninvited guest breaks through a window or flimsy door. In most cases, “it’s not an attempt to commit a crime,” Chief Gardner said. “They truly believe that’s where they live.” Or where their friends live.Consider the head-spinning dialogue when Barbara Nilsen found an intruder on her couch, removing his shoes.She: “Why are you in my house?”He: “Because you said come in.”She: “I did not say come in, and you need to leave.”He: “Well, why would I be here if you didn’t say come in?”She: “Because you’re very drunk and confused and you need to leave.”Finally, he put his shoes on and left.Jackie Sobel, who has lived among students for close to 50 years, called the police about a would-be intruder one snowy night: He wouldn’t stop banging on the door even after she told him he was at the wrong house. But when she saw that the guy was bare-chested, she brought him a T-shirt.“I couldn’t stand to see him in the cold,” she said.Her neighbor Nina White, another half-century resident, also took pity on an unwelcome visitor. Hers is the most famous story in the neighborhood, perhaps because it most resembles the trespass of Goldilocks into the home of the Three Bears. She was making dinner when her daughter tugged at her elbow.“Mommy, Mommy,” the child said, “would you get that man out of my bed? I want to play in my room.”Ms. White thought her daughter was being silly. “There’s no man in your bed,” she said. But the girl insisted — three times, as in the fairy tale — so her mother checked, to humor her. Sure enough, a student was zonked out in her room.Ms. White didn’t scream. She didn’t call the police. Instead, noting that, drunk as he was, her intruder seemed to have taken care to let his shoes dangle off the end of the bed, she pronounced him “some mother’s son.”When she woke up the mother’s son and asked him if he knew where he was, he looked around at the posters of animals on the bedroom walls and said, “I’m in some enchanted land.”Ms. White lent the disenchanted youth a coat and escorted him to the fraternity house he had been aiming for in the first place.Arguments about whether an intrusion is actually taking place — and if so, who is the intruder and who is the intruded upon — are common.The first thing David McClelland’s couch surfer said when roused was, “What are you doing in my room?”When Mr. McClelland tried to explain that he had it backward, his visitor challenged him to a fight — just as soon as he returned from the bathroom. Mr. McClelland was happy to show him the way. He opened the front door and the student, clad only in boxer shorts, stepped outside — and urinated on the front porch. The police officer summoned by Mr. McClelland waited until the young man was finished, then cuffed him and hauled him to jail, dressed as he was.So that was the end of that. Except Mr. McClelland found that the student had also relieved himself on the couch.When they met in court a few months later, and he realized the boy was a freshman in his first semester, his desire to punish evaporated.“Yes, somebody peed in the house,” he said, “but nobody got hurt, nobody was injured, nothing was stolen.” And when the student reimbursed him for the damage to his sofa, “we got a nicer couch out of the deal.”Jackie Sobel obtained a different sort of satisfaction when she met her intruder in court. “I said I didn’t want to take it any further,” she recalled. “I just wanted to scare him as much as he scared me.”
Opioids on the Quad As other college students head out to party on a Saturday night, Julie Linneman, a sophomore at Villanova University, rides the subway to a small rowhouse in West Philadelphia to meet with “her people,” a posse of students who understand what it’s like to be taken down by opioids.Ms. Linneman is a bespectacled 22-year-old who favors shredded jeans. She is a fan of cooking shows, fantasy fiction and Paul McCartney. She spent her first attempt at sophomore year — the one at Northern Kentucky University — in her dorm room, high on heroin.Coming to terms with a habit that nearly killed her, she has found support at the Haven at Drexel, Drexel University’s housing for students in recovery. Seven students from colleges in the Philadelphia area — including the University of Pennsylvania, Temple and Villanova — live, eat and socialize here, where they can abstain without temptation.More converge during these Saturday night meetings. “Sometimes you just need to be around other students who know what you have gone through,” Ms. Linneman said. They share snacks, drink water instead of beer, and talk about their life-threatening addictions.Ms. Linneman, who agreed to be named because she hopes to pursue a career in recovery advocacy, got her first pills — Vyvanse and Adderall, stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder — in high school from the boy with the locker next to hers. She soon moved on to prescription painkillers like Percocet. The “warm blanket” effect alleviated debilitating anxiety and loneliness.Once at college, she replaced pills with bags of cheap heroin. Her roommate moved out. The drug rendered her friendless. “It was one of the most lonely times of my life,” she recalled. She grew thin and pale. She would sit in the cafeteria alone, barely eating, occasionally nodding off. The workers would ask, “Are you O.K.?”She still managed to get decent grades and to keep her addiction hidden at her job. By the end of the semester, Ms. Linneman’s father knew something was wrong. Over winter break, he gathered her sister and brother for an uncomfortable intervention. She wasn’t ready to seek help and went back to school. She began skipping classes and eventually dropped out. Then she was ready.Nasty withdrawal symptoms make stopping doubly hard. She spent four and a half months in a New Jersey rehabilitation center before joining the Haven, first as a resident, now as a frequent visitor. She has been clean for a year and a half.The opioid epidemic has ravaged communities around the nation — deaths from overdoses now outnumber deaths from car crashes — prompting President Trump to establish a federal task force and, on Thursday, to declare a public health emergency, allowing some grant money to be released to combat the problem and some laws and regulations to be eased. The task force is to issue a plan of action this week.Already on campuses, recovery programs are expanding and multiplying, populated by students who have struggled with dependence on Percocet (oxycodone) and Vicodin (hydrocodone), as well as those who have moved on to fentanyl and heroin, which are far cheaper on the street than prescription pills.Little data exist on the extent of the problem among college students. But according to a 2016 national survey of them by the University of Michigan, 7 percent of 870 respondents said they had misused opioid painkillers; 4 percent had done so in the previous year. For 19- to 22-year-olds who hadn’t gone to college or had dropped out, which is common when struggling with addiction, close to 13 percent said they had misused painkillers.Sean Esteban McCabe, a Michigan researcher who has studied student addiction for close to 20 years, said misuse is most prevalent on competitive campuses, where students are more affluent and have better access to prescribed pills. Studies have indicated that athletes in high-contact sports like ice hockey and wrestling, who are often prescribed painkillers, are particularly vulnerable. Campus users, Dr. McCabe said, tend to be white, live in fraternity or sorority houses, and have lower grade-point averages.Thanks to better prevention education and treatment, heroin use among college students has flattened out, and abuse of painkillers seems to be dropping. A decade ago, 9 percent in the Michigan survey said they had misused within the previous year.This news has not heartened advocates, though, largely because the number of deaths has actually risen. Public health officials blame a black market flooded with more dangerous options like fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic that is 100 times more potent than morphine. It is the opioid that killed Prince.Opioid-related deaths among Americans age 24 and under almost doubled from 2005 to 2015, when 3,165 were reported, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The number of opioid-related emergency room visits by young people also nearly doubled over five years, from 52 per 100,000 patients to 97 in 2014, according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services.Last May, four students at Johns Hopkins University were hospitalized after overdosing on opioids during a late-night fraternity party. Furman University in Greenville, S.C., lost a student a day before his graduation last spring when he overdosed on fentanyl. A sophomore at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who had just spent the weekend with his mother at a Tar Heel football game, was found dead in his bedroom. In his system were traces of the opioids he had tried desperately to kick.States have urged colleges to take action. New York and Colorado are earmarking millions of dollars to their public colleges for prevention education and research. Maryland now requires colleges and universities to offer arriving students a drug-prevention class that focuses on the risks of opioid use. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who heads the federal addiction task force, announced this year a $1 million increase for recovery dorms on public campuses in his state.It is not uncommon for stores near campuses, health centers and dorms to stock free overdose reversal kits of naloxone. And the return to school now includes a bustle of overdose-prevention training sessions for residence hall assistants, campus police officers and health care workers.Last year, West Virginia University, in a state that leads the nation in fatal drug overdoses, started a parent support group. Mothers and fathers of young users gather monthly, some calling in remotely, to tell stories of spoons going missing from kitchen cutlery drawers and students calling home, desperate for money, dropping out of classes or getting arrested. Sometimes the parents cry uncontrollably.•Prescription pills are part of the party mix. Xanax, a highly addictive anxiety drug, has become a popular accompaniment to beer and vodka shots. Adderall is crushed for snorting. And Vicodin is ingested as a relaxant, available from students with prescriptions or on an online black market.Dr. Joseph Lee, medical director for youth services at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, says that students act as mixologists, creating dangerous drug and alcohol cocktails for themselves and friends. “They are alarmingly familiar with what they can do to get high, but not the danger,” he said, “and they don’t know where to get help.”Students in recovery confirm this. Many of them say that in high school and college they were purposeful about their drug use, smoking pot to calm down and taking stimulants to speed up. The technique worked well, until overuse and mixed use began to alter the impact. Drugs that were supposed to do one thing did another.Bart Arconti, a junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, got hooked on prescription painkillers in the basement of his best friend’s townhouse in a Baltimore suburb. He was 17. His friend had bought hydrocodone from a neighbor. They crushed a pill on the washing machine lid and snorted it. It became his favorite high.Mr. Arconti hopes his story might inspire others to get help. He stopped taking opioids four and a half years ago after several stints in rehabilitation. He says users destined to become addicts generally experiment until they find the drug they want. “There is a lot to choose from,” he said.It should not be a surprise that today’s 20-somethings have developed a taste for prescription pill cocktails. Pills are ubiquitous in homes, schools and offices. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health in 2015 found that 119 million Americans, 12 and older, take prescription painkillers, tranquilizers, sedatives or, increasingly among children and young adults, stimulants like Adderall. That’s nearly half the population.Painkillers in particular have surged. The sale of opioids quadrupled between 1999 and 2010, according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine. By 2012, doctors were writing 259 million opioid prescriptions a year, enough for every American adult to have his or her own bottle. The National Institute on Drug Abuse has been encouraging doctors to reduce the number of addictive pills they hand out. Parents are being told to dispose of unused painkillers, and drug companies are producing opioids in gel forms, so they can’t be crushed to snort.Dr. Andrew Kolodny, the co-director of Opioid Policy Research at Brandeis University’s Heller School for Social Policy and Management, describes the drug surge as “a pill-for-everything culture,” which he says has significantly affected how young people feel about prescription pills when they go off to college. Multiple studies have shown that the more available pills are to young people, the more likely they are to use them.“Today, if you grow up in a home where pills are used for every little problem,” he said, “you are likely to leave for college with a lot less fear about them.”•Throughout October, a wall of painted sneakers has greeted visitors to the University of North Carolina’s student union. It’s part of an exhibit entitled “Step Into the Soles of Recovery,” sponsored by the university’s four-year-old recovery program. Alongside the shoes are the personal accounts of the students who decorated them. The laces of one sneaker are wrapped tightly around it. On a piece of paper nearby, the student wrote: “For me, addiction always felt suffocating.”Frank Allison used heroin and drank heavily until he was 40; now 51, he heads the U.N.C. recovery program. He said the exhibit was a way for some of the four-dozen students in his program to talk candidly with the campus about their struggles, part of a push to destigmatize addiction and shift attitudes about treatment.Mr. Allison wants to see a move away from a “moral model” that treats students with substance issues like failures with no self-control instead of like people with a chronic illness, which is how the American Society of Addiction Medicine defines it. Physicians believe that this viewpoint will help frame the opioid problem for parents and educators, and help funnel recovery and prevention funds onto campuses.U.N.C. offers a cadre of services that largely depend on where students are in their recovery — six months substance-free or 60 months substance-free. Two years ago, Mr. Allison persuaded administrators to offer beds on a drug- and alcohol-free dorm floor. Three of his students currently live there. Some choose to be closely monitored, through breathalyzers and urine tests. The university helps them find therapists and coaches who accompany them to multiple recovery meetings a week. Others have chosen more autonomy but attend Mr. Allison’s workshops on meditation, mindfulness and balanced living.Like others in the movement, he refers to addiction as a “substance use disorder” and refuses to use the word “failure” when referring to relapses.“People don’t misuse substances because they are bad people,” he said. “I wasn’t a bad person. I was a sick person. Having a substance use disorder is like having diabetes or a heart condition.”Mr. Arconti, now 26 and pursuing a degree in Asian studies, says that Mr. Allison’s vision is reflected in the recovery community. The group, mostly male, consists of former frat boys, rock climbers and hip-hop fans, many not yet of legal drinking age. While some arrived in the program after too much dorm-room pot smoking, Mr. Arconti’s addiction lasted years. At the height of it, he made frequent “runs” to a drug-infested neighborhood in West Baltimore. Some of his friends have since died. Others are in jail. That was before he woke up one morning in a seedy hotel room and decided his body was spent. He committed to stopping.When there are U.N.C. basketball games Mr. Arconti watches with his recovery friends. Together, they go to Durham Bulls games and amusement parks. But it is at weekly meetings where the recovery ethos shines. Students talk about sober dating, relapse temptations and struggles to make time for studying and recovery. When they speak specifically about their addictions, they are quick to play down the drugs they gravitated toward. Instead, they focus on the illness they share, and the future.During a recent meeting, when it was his turn to talk, Mr. Arconti said: “I’m happy to be here. I’m mentally and spiritually feeling well.”Nationally, more students are seeking treatment. Last year, about one in two patients at the Minnesota youth treatment center of the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation were being treated for opioid addiction. In 2010, one in six were. And the number of opioid-related claims for coverage by Blue Cross Blue Shield has almost doubled since 2010 for college-age patients.The Haven at Drexel is part of a network called the Haven at College, which started in 2012 with one residence, at the University of Southern California, where young people could bond over a common struggle. Now there are five — four on or near California campuses and the one at Drexel — housing more than 50 young adults.The umbrella organization is run by two former users — alcohol and heroin were their drugs of choice. The cost is $1,900 to $3,800 a month, which can be defrayed by financial aid, alumni funds earmarked for recovery and Haven work-study. Students who live in the houses receive meals, coaching from a licensed clinician and support from a house manager who monitors their whereabouts. There are curfews for newcomers, penalties for missing them and chores for everyone.But mostly, students say, there is camaraderie.Most of the houses are near dorms or fraternity houses, in what Holly Sherman, a founder and the executive director, calls the “war zone of party central.” Still, or perhaps because of this, it is not uncommon to have dozens of people show up for the Saturday night meeting.Ms. Sherman says students arrive on campus and wonder: “‘How am I going to stay sober if I can’t find a sober community?’ What we do is work with the university to establish that community for them.”Matthew, a 24-year-old former varsity athlete, sometimes attends the meetings. A May graduate of Albright College in Reading, Pa., he asked that his last name not be used because he wants to work as a financial adviser or analyst at a Fortune 500 company. But the opioid obsession he developed in college is getting in the way. He hopes the experiences of other students, many of whom know well the allure of opioids but have managed to kick the habit, will rub off on him.He was handed a “Perc” freshman year by an older teammate he looked up to. At the time, he was at a small Catholic college in a Philadelphia suburb. “I’m in college,” he recalled thinking. “Let’s experiment, let’s party. He’s cool. I want to be cool.”Soon after, a dealer introduced him to heroin. He began snorting before class, while doing homework and instead of going to parties and drinking. The heroin made all the drudgeries — homework, dining hall food, boring classes — seem manageable. “During Accounting 101, I’m in the bathroom snorting heroin, thinking: ‘I’ve got to get back to class.’”When he transferred to Albright College, he dialed back on the heroin and returned to Percocet. Last summer, shortly after graduating, he went to a rehabilitation center in Florida.“I’m not ready to just throw my life away for a stupid blue pill,” he said, perched on a weathered coach in the recovery center living room. Still, he acknowledged, he struggles to kick the habit. “I don’t want to do this for the rest of my life. I’ve got really big goals.”
Momofuku Ssam Bar Keeps Evolving Under a Singaporean Chef When I see something wrapped in a banana leaf, I am almost always interested in what’s inside. Unwrapping one such package at Momofuku Ssam Bar recently I was extra interested, because the restaurant has a new chef named Max Ng who is a citizen of Singapore, and one of the dishes he has brought with him from that country is a whole skate wing cooked in a banana leaf.The wing was rubbed top and bottom with sambal belacan, a Malaysian sauce built on a foundation of fermented-shrimp paste. It was a little spicy and strongly, disorientingly funky in a way that gave me the feeling of trying to stand up in a small boat in high surf. On the side, Mr. Ng served a bowl of congee to act as a kind of buffer, although it was by no means bland.Under the orange belacan I could taste the green-tea flavor of the banana leaf, drawn out by steam. Mr. Ng had intensified that, too, by charring the leaf so aggressively that it was still smoldering when it came to the table.Smoke in restaurants is usually found in captivity these days, caged within a glass or a cloche or a bag and carefully liberated, to oohs and aahs, before it drifts toward the ceiling and is gone. This is a favorite modernist party trick that anyone can do with the right smoker and pump. It is kind of cool the first time you see it.The smoke rising from the banana-leaf skate was the old, Promethean kind, and if I’m reading its message correctly it signaled another shift in direction for Ssam Bar. Founded by David Chang in the East Village in 2006, the restaurant evolved so quickly in its first two years that it took three New York Times reviews just to keep up.In the very beginning, Ssam Bar sold three kinds of Korean burritos. Dana Bowen, writing for The Times’s cheap-eats column, called them “enjoyable enough,” then spent the rest of her space on the after-hours experiments that Mr. Chang and three other cooks were serving late at night, like a whole roasted pork butt, to be pulled apart with tongs that quickly become as joyously greasy as everything and everybody else at the table.By early 2007, when Frank Bruni weighed in, the after-hours experiments had taken over the menu, which offered previously unimagined combinations of kimchi, country ham, hamachi, rice sticks, fish sauce and organ meats. Ssam Bar had become “a nearly full-fledged restaurant in near-perfect sync with the times,” Mr. Bruni wrote. Apparently it wasn’t done fledging yet; he returned in 2008 to promote it from two stars to three.Review overkill? No. Ssam Bar wasn’t just changing its menu. It rewrote the rules by which critically acclaimed restaurants were supposed to operate, stripping away comforts (chairs with backs, sound systems with a “low” setting) and amenities (reservations, unshared tables), and gambling that everybody would be too stunned by the food to complain.It worked. Ssam Bar mounted a guerrilla attack on the dining establishment, and it won before anybody quite knew what was going on, Mr. Chang included.There followed a long period of refinement and maturation, which is more than some guerrilla outfits can say. The wine list now takes more than 20 seconds to read, and is especially worth exploring for fans of gamay and sparkling wine. (Or both — there’s a sparkling gamay.) Under Matthew Rudofker, the executive chef from 2010 until May, Ssam Bar expanded beyond pork shoulder to other sizable cuts of meat: rib-eyes, briskets, whole ducks.Over the years, like many of Mr. Chang’s restaurants, Ssam Bar was increasingly infiltrated by modern techniques, fermentation, cutting-edge plating styles and umami-building tricks. The kitchen worked at a very high level, but at times it felt slightly deracinated, as if it drew much of its inspiration from other islands in the Momofuku archipelago.Carefully but confidently, Mr. Ng is moving away from that style and toward one of his own. He has gone back to the traditions of Asia, particularly street food and Singaporean cuisine. Like the char on that smoldering banana leaf, his techniques tend to be premodern, even though he has worked for nobody but Mr. Chang since moving to the United States in 2011, starting with an externship at Ssam Bar during culinary school and rising to chef de cuisine at Momofuku Ko.Mr. Ng has been trying his hand at the fish-shaped cakes from Japan known as taiyaki. He has a terrific idea for what to do with them: stuff them with foie gras. In his hands they’re almost French, because he fills the molds with croissant dough rather than pancake batter and glazes the crust with honey and white port. Over the top he strews some candied puffed rice that would make a fine breakfast; the whole dish would make a fine breakfast, come to think of it, although you’d stand up afterward knowing your day had already peaked.Sizzling eggs arrive not quite set in a cast-iron pan hot enough to finish cooking them at the table. The heat also softens a slice of pork terrine, which melts to coat the eggs. When I first tried this open-faced omelet, the eggs had been poured around a handful of chanterelles. Now they’ve been replaced by smoked bluefish.To make one of the most original corn dishes I’ve seen in a long time, Mr. Ng cleaves the cobs lengthwise into quarters and fries them until they curl. They are dusted with spice. You pick one up with your fingers and swipe it through a black aioli of squid ink or a white streak of whipped ricotta, which will melt like butter. Then you eat the kernels from the cob as if you were gnawing the meat off a baby back rib.These new dishes live alongside some legacies of Mr. Rudofker’s regime. There are cured sardines on long fingers of toast spread with hozon, the fermented chickpea paste that in this case plays the role of butter very well.Big cuts of meat are still offered. They have to be ordered ahead, but a variation of the rotisserie duck can sometimes be had on the spur of the moment. The breast is rubbed heartily with five-spice powder and fanned out over rice, the idea being to wrap it in lettuce with fried shallots and gochujang, without getting too distracted when the duck’s fried bones show up about 15 minutes later.As if he had realized that a restaurant that acts like a teenage punk is not as endearing once it reaches middle age, Mr. Chang redid Ssam Bar last year. The seats and bar stools have backs. The communal tables have been replaced by smaller ones where you sit only with people you know. Somehow the noise has been tamed.You won’t have tinnitus by the time you get to Mr. Ng’s Singaporean coconut pie, which has a smooth, sweet, wobbly, pandan-scented filling like chess pie, a dome of whipped cream made from coconut milk and a dark brown drizzle of coconut-sugar caramel.Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

If You Missed Diwali in India, Dallas Is the Place to Be DALLAS — Two weeks after the close of the State Fair of Texas, with the smells of deep-fried Oreos and funnel cake still lingering in the air, 60,000 Indian-Americans from across the country are expected to descend on the same site this Saturday to observe Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights and one of India’s most important holidays.Like the state fair, the annual event — known officially as the DFW Diwali Mela (for Dallas-Fort Worth) — is built around food and mounted on a scale worthy of Texas. Held in and around the Cotton Bowl, it is among the largest and grandest Diwali celebrations in the United States.Dallas is not the most obvious setting. Though the city and its surrounding area have one of the nation’s largest Indian populations (108,000 in the 2010 census), the Chicago region’s is nearly twice that size, and the New York-New Jersey area’s is more than five times as large. The Dallas festival doesn’t even take place on Diwali (Oct. 19 this year) because the state fair is using the fairgrounds then.But for those who attend the Dallas mela, Nov. 4 may as well be the official holiday. What brings them here is the sheer scope and Technicolor splash of the spectacle: Bollywood singers are flown in from India. A cast of 150 volunteers stages a production of the Ramlila (a re-enactment of the Ramayana, the Hindu epic). Three giant burning effigies of the 10-headed Hindu villain Ravana and his family crackle into the night, and hundreds of cooks fry up syrupy, spice-laced Indian sweets.This year’s festival will have a slightly different tone than in years past, coming so soon after Hurricane Harvey, which devastated much of Houston and other parts of southeastern Texas. Organizers are expecting a sizable contingent from Houston’s large Indian community to travel more than 200 miles to Dallas, in part because Houston’s Diwali celebration on Oct. 7 was smaller this year in the wake of the floods.“We have so many friends there,” said Satish Gupta, who founded the Dallas mela. (Its supporting organization, the DFW Indian Cultural Society, is aiding hurricane relief efforts.) “It’s not even a question. Whatever help we can provide.”This means, too, that the coming event could be the largest in the history of the city’s festival.One of its central components — and the backdrop to every other activity at the mela — is the dizzying array of foods, with special care taken to make sure that every region’s Diwali-specific treats are represented. This multicultural spirit is what sets the Dallas mela apart from those in other cities.“In a single festival, you can eat Gujarati snacks while listening to performances in Tamil, and watching South Indian dance,” said Kalpana Fruitwala, an organizer.For the event, Subash Chander, the owner of the popular Bombay Sweets & Snacks in suburban Irving, creates a pack of Bengali mithai, milk- and nut-based sweets. It includes neon-pink chum chum (coconut-coated milk solids), and gulab jamun (syrup-soaked balls of deep-fried batter) filled with a silky mixture of cream and ground almonds.On a recent afternoon, Mr. Chander was deeply concentrating on an enormous mixing bowl heated to exactly 450 degrees, making sure the milk and shredded coconut for the chum chum were being churned to the ideal softness. If the temperature rises even a few degrees, or the mixture is stirred for too long, he said, the treat loses its luxurious, slightly bouncy texture.“You have to be very patient,” Mr. Chander said. “Only after 18 years have I figured out the secret to making chum chum this soft.”The response at the festival makes all the care worthwhile. “All night, we have this big line that wraps around many times,” he said. “It got so long that the organizers had to install stands for people to wait.”Lalith Thota, who is busy preparing to open the restaurant India 101, also in Irving, will make jangiri, a thick, patterned fritter soaked in sugar syrup (with a shape not unlike that State Fair of Texas staple, funnel cake) that is eaten widely in Andhra Pradesh.Nearby, at the restaurant Bawarchi Biryanis, Anil Sukkagopal said his Diwali booth will serve Mysore pak, a rich, crumbly pastry made of ghee and chickpea flour that has its origins in Karnataka.“We want to create an environment like the street markets in Bombay,” Mr. Sukkagopal said. “We’ll be yelling and shouting about our food. People will be crowding around. It’s a sensory experience.”At his booth, Naga Kolli, the owner of the South Indian restaurant Saravanaa Bhavan, in nearby Plano, will supplement a menu of dosas and idlis with payasam, a comforting, saffron-stained milk pudding popular in Tamil Nadu, where the dish is often consumed first thing in the morning on Diwali, right after prayers.Testing the recipe in the restaurant’s kitchen, a cook tossed in just-fried cashews and raisins into a bubbling stainless steel vat filled with milk and vermicelli noodles, to add richness and crunch.“We make it because it is made especially for Diwali in certain places,” Mr. Naga said, adding with a laugh, “The only disadvantage of payasam is that because it’s more of a liquid, people have a hard time walking around the festival with it.”The Dallas celebration has come a long way since 1994, when it began as a house party with about 50 guests, bootleg fireworks and catered food at Mr. Gupta’s home in North Dallas.When the party started to outgrow his backyard, Mr. Gupta came up with the idea to turn it into a public, community-run mela, a type of traditional festival with food and music that occurs in every village throughout India during Diwali. “We wanted to bring that flavor of home to Dallas, to give our children a closer connection to Indian culture,” he said.For the inaugural mela in 2006, Mr. Gupta ambitiously decided to book Texas Stadium in Irving. “Everyone was making fun of us,” said R.K. Panditi, a festival organizer who oversees the food vendors. “We knew we wouldn’t fill it, but I thought maybe we’ll get 15,000.”More than 38,000 people showed up, creating a major traffic jam on the freeway, and an hourlong wait just to enter the stadium. The food ran out within the first hour, so Mr. Panditi had to ask two nearby Indian restaurants to stay open until 4 a.m. to feed the crowds.Since 2011, the festival has taken place in the Cotton Bowl, which has a capacity of nearly 100,000, and the added allure of being a citywide landmark and the site of the state fair.The festival has played an enormous role in expanding the impact of the Indian community, whose population in the Dallas area alone more than doubled between 2000 and 2010. There is now a petition going around the Coppell Independent School District to make Diwali an official school holiday, and last year a seasonal Diwali postage stamp had its Texas debut at the mela here.On Saturday, vendors will arrive at the Cotton Bowl at 10 a.m. and not leave until well after midnight, when stalls once loaded with chum chum and biryani have been completely emptied of their goods.Staying until the very end is well worth it, though, as the closing event of the mela is an impressive display of fireworks shaped like diyas (lamps, a symbol of Diwali), synchronized to a colorful laser show and Bollywood music — a favorite tradition of Mr. Gupta’s ever since that first house party.“Without the fireworks,” he said, a sparkle in his eye, “there is no Diwali.”Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

José Andrés Fed Puerto Rico, and May Change How Aid Is Given SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — José Andrés was walking along a dark street in a stained T-shirt and a ball cap, trying to decompress after another day of feeding an island that has been largely without electricity since Hurricane Maria hit a month ago.He’d gone barely half a block before two women ran over to snag a selfie. A man shouted out his name from a bar running on a generator and offered to buy him a rum sour.The reaction is more subdued in rural mountain communities like Naguabo, where Mr. Andrés and his crew have been delivering supplies so cooks at a small Pentecostal church can make 5,000 servings of arroz con pollo and carne guisada every day. There, people touch his sleeve and whisper, “Gracias.” They surround him and pray.“He’s much more than a hero,” said Jesus R. Rivera, who was inside a cigar store watching Mr. Andrés pick out one of his daily smokes. “The situation is that still some people don’t even have food. He is all that is keeping them from starving.”It’s overwhelming, even for Mr. Andrés, the larger-than-life, Michelin-starred Spanish chef with a prolific, unfiltered social media presence, who got into a legal fight with the Trump Organization after Donald Trump made disparaging comments about Mexicans.“Every day I have this personal anxiety inside,” Mr. Andrés said during a Jeep ride through the countryside in late October. “We only came here to try to help a few thousand because nobody had a plan to feed Puerto Rico, and we opened the biggest restaurant in the world in a week. That’s how crazy this is.”Since he hit the ground five days after the hurricane devastated this island of 3.4 million on Sept. 20, he has built a network of kitchens, supply chains and delivery services that as of Monday had served more than 2.2 million warm meals and sandwiches. No other single agency — not the Red Cross, the Salvation Army nor any government entity — has fed more people freshly cooked food since the hurricane, or done it in such a nurturing way.Mr. Andrés’s effort, by all accounts the largest emergency feeding program ever set up by a group of chefs, has started winding down. But it illustrates in dramatic fashion the rise of chefs as valuable players in a realm traditionally left to more-established aid organizations.With an ability to network quickly, organize kitchens in difficult circumstances and marshal raw ingredients and equipment, chef-led groups are creating a model for a more agile, local response to catastrophes.“It’s part of larger trend we’re starting to see with corporations and individuals who are applying their unique skill sets to solve problems after a disaster,” said Bob Ottenhoff, the president and chief executive of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, which helps donors make strategic contributions related to domestic and international emergencies.In addition to sending money or showing up to hand out blankets or boxes of food, companies like UPS and IBM are designing ways to quickly supply logistical and technical aid.“Chefs are part of that trend now, too,” Mr. Ottenhoff said. “They’re starting to say, ‘Look, people are in need of not just food but good food, and we know how to serve large quantities of good food very quickly.’”Kimberly Grant, the chief executive of Mr. André’s Think Food Group, which runs 27 restaurants, put it like this: “Who else can take raw ingredients that are seemingly unassociated and make them into delicious food and do it under extreme pressure?”Restaurateurs have long offered food when trouble hit their communities.Kitchens near the World Trade Center in New York served thousands of meals each day to emergency workers after 9/11. In response to the 2004 earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, the celebrity chef Cat Cora started Chefs for Humanity. Competition barbecue teams that headed to Joplin, Mo., after the 2011 tornadoes organized themselves into Operation BBQ Relief, a nonprofit group that has since responded to more than 40 disasters.Two weeks ago, a food writer in Northern California tapped the region’s best chefs to provide a steady stream of meals for people who had lost homes to wildfires. The restaurateur and TV personality Guy Fieri, who had to evacuate his Santa Rosa residence, organized a team of volunteers and began serving mashed potatoes and pork loin to firefighters and others in a parking lot.Mr. Andrés helped out after Hurricane Sandy, but his first big lesson in emergency food relief came in August, when he rallied local chefs in Houston to help feed survivors of Hurricane Harvey.Other Houston chefs and caterers started a website called “I Have Food I Need Food” and used social media to create a system to organize donations, cook food and get it delivered. They codified their effort in a manual and send it to chefs in Miami who were staring down Hurricane Irma, which landed 16 days later.Mr. Andrés went to Houston in part to study how to expand the scope of World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit association of chefs he established in 2011 after helping Haiti earthquake victims a year earlier. The idea was to learn how he and Brian MacNair, World Central Kitchen’s executive director, could add emergency food relief to an agenda that already included building school kitchens, organizing culinary training and offering other forms of support in several countries.But nothing prepared Mr. Andrés for what he faced in Puerto Rico. After taking one of the first commercial flights to the island after the storm, he realized that things were worse than anyone knew.He found his friend Jose Enrique, the chef who has been leading Puerto Rico’s farm-to-table resurgence. Mr. Enrique had no electricity to run his Restaurant Jose Enrique, in the Santurce district of San Juan. Rain poured through the roof. But he had food in the freezer. Other chefs did, too. Someone had a generator.“We decided we would just start cooking,” Mr. Enrique said.The next morning, Mr. Andrés went to a food distributor and loaded up his car. “I was already smart enough to know I would need aluminum pans, so I bought every aluminum pan I could,” he said.They began cooking big pots of the classic island stew called sancocho on the street in front of Mr. Enrique’s small restaurant. Word spread and the lines grew. They sent food to people waiting in 10-hour lines at gas stations. They heard that workers at the city’s biggest medical clinic were going hungry, so they added it to what was now a makeshift delivery schedule. “Every day it would just double,” Mr. Enrique said.Mr. Andrés didn’t realize that his was the biggest hot-food game on the island until a week or so after they started. Someone from the Salvation Army pulled up and asked for 120 meals.“In my life I never expected the Salvation Army to be asking me for food,” he said. “If one of the biggest NGOs comes to us for food, who is actually going to be feeding Puerto Rico? We are. We are it.”More cooks arrived to help. Partnerships were forged with other aid groups and large food companies. Sandwiches and fruit were added to their repertory of rice dishes.The team moved its base of operation to the island’s largest arena. To pay for it all, at least in the beginning, they used Mr. Andrés’s credit cards, or cash from the pockets of the Orvis fly-fishing vest he wore like a battle jacket.Mr. Andrés left the island only a few times, the first after 11 days on the ground. He had lost 25 pounds and became dehydrated.His team deployed food trucks, like a strike force, to isolated neighborhoods and towns that needed help. Agents of Homeland Security Investigations, a division of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, were serving as emergency workers, and staying in the same hotel as Mr. Andrés’s crew. The chef persuaded them to load food into their vehicles every morning as they headed out to patrol.With limited ability to communicate, the crew organized everything with satellite phones, WhatsApp and a big paper map of all the feeding stations on the island, which Mr. Andrés carried like a general at war.He negotiated with a chain of vocational schools around the island to let culinary students cook there. During visits to his kitchens, 18 in all, he admonished volunteers to add more mayonnaise to sandwiches, keep the temperature up on the pans of rice or serve bigger portions.The Compass Group, a giant American food-service operation that Mr. Andrés recently partnered with, sent someone who understood what it takes to feed several thousand people at a time.Mr. Andrés recruited his own chefs, too. David Thomas, accustomed to making $540 suckling pigs as the executive chef at Mr. Andrés’s Bazaar Meat restaurant in Las Vegas, suddenly found himself trying to figure out how to make meals out of donations that might include 5,000 pounds of lunch meat one day and 17 pallets of yogurt the next.The operation grew so big that at one point you couldn’t find any sliced cheese in all of Puerto Rico. The team had bought it all up for sandwiches.Eventually, the effort would cost World Central Kitchen about $400,000 a day, paid for by donations from foundations, celebrities and a flood of smaller donors, as well as two Federal Emergency Management Agency contracts — one early on to cover the cost of 140,000 meals, and another for $10 million to cover two weeks’ worth of meals while Mr. Andrés’s team scaled down the operation.Mr. Andrés, who often rolls right over regulations and ignores the word “no,” clashed more than once with FEMA and other large organizations that have a more-seasoned and methodical approach. In meetings and telephone calls, FEMA officials reminded him that he and his people lacked the experience needed to organize a mass emergency feeding operation, he said.““We are not perfect, but that doesn’t mean the government is perfect,” Mr. Andrés said. “I am doing it without red tape and 100 meetings.”FEMA officials contacted for this article were quick to point out that many other groups and agencies besides World Central Kitchen were feeding Puerto Rico; a spokesman would not publicly discuss Mr. Andrés or his operation.Late last week, the system that was serving more than 130,000 meals a day became much smaller. A core crew will likely keep things going until Thanksgiving, with one main kitchen and a handful in some of the neediest regions.Mr. Andrés flew home to Washington, D.C., on Thursday. “This has been like my little Vietnam, but now I need to go back to normal life,” he said.He never intended to stay as long as he did, he said. Or to feed an island.“At the end, I couldn’t forgive myself if I didn’t try to do what I thought was right,” he said. “We need to think less sometimes and dream less and just make it happen.”Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

When ‘Conservatives’ Turned Into Radicals In 1953, a weathered journalist named Frank Chodorov founded the Intercollegiate Society of Individualists, an organization intended to halt the march of progressive ideas on American campuses. It’s still around, known today as the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, dedicated to promoting things like limited government, “personal responsibility,” a free-market economy and traditional values.It was the I.S.I. — through a group called the Collegiate Network — that supported the conservative student newspaper where I worked while at the University of Michigan. I was, at the time, interested in how much of a role the state seemed to play in my life, and how all our lives could be freer, more self-contained. I wanted to explore the underpinnings of conservatism with other believers. The paper I joined was perhaps more libertarian than traditionally conservative, but the I.S.I. paid our publishing costs and sent us to editors’ conferences; as far as I knew, that meant that the people who paid for my first trip outside the Eastern time zone voted for George W. Bush and thought the Iraq war was a good idea.Chodorov, I’d later learn, was not this kind of conservative. He vigorously opposed all forms of military intervention and spent one 1938 essay reminding readers “that war is caused by the conditions that bring about poverty; that no war is justified; that no war benefits the people.” In the 1950s, he differed strongly with William F. Buckley Jr. — his handpicked choice as the first president of the I.S.I. — out of a belief that conservatives’ efforts to combat international Communism would be more dangerous than Communism itself. The man whose organization was meant to ensure I became a rock-ribbed conservative seemed to exist far away from what the group was sponsoring half a century later. “Conservatism,” I learned, can be a slippery thing — flexible in its ideas, and something else entirely in practice.For centuries, conservative politics has considered itself a means of preserving something — a culture, a way of being, an imagined notion of what once was and should be again. For Edmund Burke, the Irish statesman credited with some of conservative thought’s earliest underpinnings, to be a conservative was to avoid the human temptation to progress too far beyond our bounds. “The great error of our nature,” he wrote in 1756, “is not to know where to stop” and ultimately “to lose all we have gained by an insatiable pursuit after more.” Burke wanted to preserve the cultural legacy of European monarchies, writing during the French Revolution: “We fear God, we look up with awe to kings; with affection to parliaments; with duty to magistrates; with reverence to priests; and with respect to nobility. Why? Because when such ideas are brought before our minds, it is natural to be so affected.” To be a conservative, for him, was to obey a “natural” order, rather than trying, in our hubris, to conceive of a better one.Conservatives have tried to preserve religious values, class-based social systems, the concept of the “Western democratic order.” They gave the oldest political party in England its name. In America, freed from ties to monarchy or aristocracy, they tried to cast in amber the ideals they believed animated the nation’s founding. Conservatism has told us again and again that what came before us was most likely better than what will follow, and that old ideals are the basis of who we are as a people. Buckley, the founder of National Review, was a self-described conservative, believing that, as the conservative theorist Peter Viereck once wrote in The Times, “freedom depends on the traditional value-code of the West.” So is Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. So is Mitt Romney, who during the 2012 presidential campaign called himself “severely conservative.”Is Donald Trump? As of last year’s Republican primaries, an array of “Never Trump” conservatives were arguing that the candidate wouldn’t merely be a bad president but a liberal one, ramping up the federal deficit and taking leftist stances on health care, L.G.B.T. rights and foreign policy. His very temperament, with its lack of humility or restraint, was said to go against the fabric of conservatism. But many voters didn’t share these worries: In Election Day exit polls, 81 percent of those who described themselves as “conservative” said they had voted for Trump. The modern licentiousness that conservative figures used to condemn, the promises to use government power in ways that would normally unsettle conservative ideologues — voters could embrace these, so long as it appeared to benefit them. Their politics weren’t those of William F. Buckley; they were those of Donald J. Trump.What my time at that student paper taught me is that conservatism has long had two faces — one for its ideological elites and another for its voters. Its intellectual class debates free markets and constitutional law, but the message for voters is consistently different, full of sinister socialist plots and black welfare recipients soaking up tax money. The conversations I had in our office on Sunday afternoons took place against a backdrop of complaints about “liberal fascism,” of unceasing racial rhetoric in every publication and comments section, of the national anti-liberal student group Young Americans for Freedom planning a gathering in the center of our campus for “Catch an Illegal Immigrant Day.”Trump rejected only half that equation: the elites who believed their ideas determined the trajectory of conservative thought. He excised the ideological middlemen and spoke directly to voters, who did not need to wrestle with coherent principles or define the nature of the relationship between citizen and state. They were free to decide that universal health care and copious use of executive orders were conservative values after all — and when they did, the very people whose entire careers had depended on carefully defining and nurturing the conservative movement would come to look like liberal shills. As Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona said late in October, announcing that he would not seek re-election: “It is clear at this moment that a traditional conservative” — a believer in free trade, limited government and all the rest — “has a narrower and narrower path to nomination in the Republican Party.”In his mission statement for National Review, published in 1955, Buckley imagined a magazine that “stands athwart history, yelling stop”; its conservatism wanted to hold the reins of societal change, stopping it in its tracks. But even this vision of conservatism had to distance itself from others. The John Birch Society was too conspiracy-minded. Obstinate segregationists, like the Alabama governor George Wallace, were frowned upon. Ayn Rand was a bellicose atheist. Those elements, though, still saw themselves as conservative — sometimes more conservative than those who wanted to displace them. When National Review repudiated the head of the John Birch Society, Buckley received piles of letters. “I have always believed you to be a true conservative,” said one. “However, since you seem categorically to accept most of the left-wing programs, I’m beginning to doubt your sincerity.”These other conservatives would fight efforts to integrate schools long after mainstream conservatives gave in. They would power right-wing talk radio and support the Moral Majority. They would eventually create the Tea Party, send Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton to Capitol Hill and help elect Donald Trump to the highest office in the land — all without much input from Buckley, or Ryan, or Mitch McConnell, or Commentary.More important, they didn’t fear change; they desired it. Their imaginings ran not toward the stopping of history but toward constitutional conventions and civil wars. The emergence among them of the “alt-right” wasn’t a reaction to progressive threats but to a perceived lack of radical action from conservative leaders. Such voters no longer wanted to preserve an America that was going astray; they wanted to raze and remodel it, with Trump as head of demolition. As the Fox News host Tucker Carlson wrote in Politico, early in 2016, Republican voters “seem to know a lot about Trump, more than the people who run their party. They know that he isn’t a conventional ideological conservative. They seem relieved.”But this dynamic had been clear for at least a decade. From my first year of college to the weeks in which, as editor in chief, I closed my final edition of the paper, I came to a realization: Whatever conservatism told me it was intellectually — whatever ideas we discussed, whatever policy papers I read — could never compete with what conservatism was in practice. At the conferences the Collegiate Network sent me to, no one was discussing tax policy or the nature of effective governance; they were debating whether Barack Obama was a “real” American and whether Sarah Palin could unseat him in 2012, based on pure and unfettered loathing. Nothing was being conserved.Conservative voters have known this for some time. This is why they voted last year for a president who swore not to preserve but to upend. Since Barry Goldwater’s 1964 campaign for the presidency, Republicans have worked to maintain a two-tiered party — one for the ideologues who believed in Burke and Buckley, free markets and free minds, and one for the voters, who are often moved less by a system of ideas than by id and grievance. It was always the voters, though, who really mattered. And it was the voters who won.
A Modernist Box Among the Victorians On a recent afternoon, Leslie Dowling motored down a narrow residential street beneath a leafy canopy, past small, tightly clustered houses from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with gable and hip roofs and broad front porches. Then there was a glimpse of something new — a modernist box of a house seemingly elevated in the treetops —before she twisted the steering wheel to enter a narrow driveway and slipped into a tiny carport beneath the structure.“We both drive Minis” — a necessity for navigating the tight turns, said Ms. Dowling, 49, who owns the house with her husband, Carlo Momo, 58. Ms. Dowling, an architect who once worked for Michael Graves, is a partner in Dowling Studios, a bicoastal architecture firm she runs with her San Francisco-based twin sister, Julie.Clad in horizontal red-cedar boards punctuated by floor-to-ceiling aluminum-and-glass doors and windows, and lifted off the ground where it meets the sidewalk, the house, which was completed last year, comes as a surprise on a traditional street in the center of Princeton, N.J.But perhaps even more surprising is that it is in the municipality’s new Witherspoon-Jackson historic district, established last year.When Ms. Dowling and Mr. Momo bought the lot in 2014, they had no idea a historic designation might be in the works. They were just so pleased to find space in the center of town that they agreed to pay not only the $600,000 price, but also the real estate agent’s commission of $30,000.“Downtown is bursting at the seams,” said Mr. Momo, a partner in the Terra Momo restaurant group, which owns the nearby Terra Momo Bread Company, Teresa Caffe and Mediterra restaurant. “This is right on the seam, so I said, ‘Let’s do something here.’”The lot already had “a 100-plus-year-old” dilapidated house on it, Ms. Dowling said, which had been abandoned for many years.“We bought it thinking we were going to save the front half,” she continued, while extending the house with an addition on the back. “But it was so rotted and poorly cared for that we couldn’t salvage it.”So they gave the porch to an architect working on the renovation of a house down the street, where the singer, actor, athlete and civil rights activist Paul Robeson was born in 1898, and slated the rest for demolition.Ms. Dowling drew up plans for a new building using existing setback requirements as her guide, while looking to maximize space. The house had to be 10 feet from either side of the 40-foot-wide lot, and 35 feet from the rear lot line. The height was limited to 30 feet.She started with a two-story box that precisely traced those limits, and then carved out space for the carport and a double-height kitchen to get the total indoor area down to 2,298 square feet — just two square feet shy of the maximum 2,300 allowed.She submitted her plans to Princeton’s building department and received a construction permit before whispers about the movement to create a historic district reached her. “I started hearing from neighbors saying, ‘Can you show us what you’re doing? We’d like to be included,’” she said.Hoping to demonstrate that she and Mr. Momo had every intention of being good neighbors, she organized a community meeting at the local library to share her design, and went door to door distributing fliers. “I built a model. I made poundcake. It was a real good-will effort,” she said. “Three people showed up.”Demolition began in April 2015, without incident. Fifteen months and about $1 million later, Ms. Dowling, Mr. Momo and their 14-year-old daughter, Anna, moved into the completed three-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom house, built by R. Faucett Construction.Ms. Dowling and Mr. Momo now spend much of their time in the airy kitchen, where soaring walls of operable windows bring in abundant natural light and breezes. “I’m the cook; she’s the baker,” Mr. Momo said.The living room has large sliding glass doors opening onto steps that lead down to the grassy backyard designed by Peter Soderman, where their dog, Pepper, goes to play. In the basement, a home office serves as the East Coast outpost of Dowling Studios.“Could I have come in and done some quasi-colonial thing, as other builders around town are doing? Sure,” Ms. Dowling said. “But what’s the better response: to build something that looked like what was here or something that is designed for today?”The couple’s feelings on the subject are clear — and at least some of their neighbors seem sympathetic. Shortly after the house was completed, representatives of the historic district contacted Mr. Momo.“They invited me onto the board,” he said, adding that he initially felt conflicted as the owner of a modern home.“I tried to decline,” he said. “But they wanted me anyway.”
Staying in Crown Heights, Even as It Gentrifies When new owners bought her Crown Heights apartment building a few years ago, Lisa Mathis feared that she might be pushed out of not only her eight-unit rental building, but also the neighborhood.But even as Crown Heights — and her building — has become a destination for New Yorkers priced out of trendier parts of Brooklyn, Ms. Mathis has found a surprising kinship with her new neighbors, rather than a clash between old and new.Ms. Mathis, 57, grew up at 80 New York Avenue. She went to P.S. 138, played handball across the street and got her first library card at the Brower Park Library. And some years later, after her marriage broke up, it was to 80 New York Avenue that she returned.At first, she and her two children lived with her mother. Then the three-bedroom, one-bath apartment across the hall opened up. That was 12 years ago.“I was so happy,” Ms. Mathis said. “It’s homey, peaceful, and my mother was across the hall. The kids were small then, and there were lots of meals that I didn’t have to cook.”Rent was $1,200, which was “a lot,” said Ms. Mathis, a court clerk specialist at New York State Surrogate’s Court, but “you sacrifice.” When they moved in, she could afford only beds and curtains at first.“In my family, you have to get the curtains right away. You can’t have people looking in at you. Maybe it’s a Southern thing,” said Ms. Mathis, whose mother was raised in North Carolina.Several months later, she bought a dining set. Several months after that, they got a couch. But if the rent was a stretch, it was worthwhile. She loved the hardwood floors and the dining room, which is divided from the living room by pocket doors. And the building felt like home, with her mother across the hall and her aunt living upstairs.So did the neighborhood. “I see faces that I grew up around,” Ms. Mathis said.The only thing she lacked was a lease, but over the next decade the rent never went up. Then, in late 2014, the building sold to new owners, Mendel and Chananya Gold, who offered tenants buyouts to get them to leave. Those who stayed endured months of construction as the other apartments were renovated.Reached on the phone, Chananya Gold said, “No comment. No comment at all.”Ms. Mathis didn’t want to move. Her son, Derek, a graphic designer who is now 26, was living with her, and she suspected that her daughter, a college student, might need to move back in when she graduated. She also knew that her aunt, who intended to stay in the building, had a rent-stabilized unit, so she went to see a lawyer. (Her mother had since retired to North Carolina.)The lawyer discovered that not only was Ms. Mathis a rent-stabilized tenant as well — lease or no — but she had been charged more than the legally allowable rent all those years. It felt like a victory. But before long, she realized that fighting for her right to stay was only the first of many skirmishes.In the fall of 2015, the heat never came on. The landlord told tenants the heating system needed to be replaced, but the winter passed without heat — at least for the rent-stabilized units: The five market-rate units were renovated with working heat that was billed to those tenants.The heat didn’t come on in Ms. Mathis’s apartment the following year either, and a solution that involved installing furnaces in the rent-stabilized apartments didn’t pass muster with city inspectors. By now, Ms. Mathis has spent two winters in an unheated apartment, huddled under electric blankets.“The first year without heat, my aunt was 79. To do that to someone of that age — I might have considered leaving if she wasn’t in the building,” Ms. Mathis said. “But she’s on fixed income and wouldn’t be able to stay in the neighborhood if she left. She and my mom were really close, so I felt like I have no choice but to stay and fight.”She continued: “It really affects the quality of life not to have heat: It’s hard to clean. It’s hard to do anything. I like to cook and have family over, and I lost two Thanksgivings and two Christmases.”There have also been frequent gas leaks, Ms. Mathis said, one of which revealed that one of the five market-rate apartments in the building had been paying for the cooking gas of the three rent-stabilized units. Another leak caused the building’s hot water and cooking gas to be shut off for a month last spring.As a result of the shared hardships, the tenants — old and new — have banded together to file several lawsuits against the landlord, including for the illegal destabilization of the renovated apartments, which have been carved into four- and five-bedrooms that rent, per room, for nearly as much as Ms. Mathis pays for her entire apartment. And last spring, they organized a rent strike.“God has been very benevolent in putting the people in this building together,” Ms. Mathis said. “Some are good at social media, some are good at writing, a few people are union organizers and some are arts-inclined — they made the signs that we put up in the window.”Ms. Mathis is optimistic that she’ll finally have heat this winter, after reaching a housing court settlement with the landlord. Large metal heating ducts, installed the previous winter, hang from her hall ceiling, and the furnace that was once mounted inside her front door has been moved to the basement.The yearslong ordeal has had one unexpected benefit. “We’re a very tight-knit building now,” Ms. Mathis said. “I don’t know if we’d have this kind of connection otherwise.”
A Bedroom for Rover, Maybe Even a Condo The moment I laid eyes on Daffodil, I vowed I would give her a good home.I found her at an adoption event for more than 50 rescued rabbits, sponsored by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals two winters ago. A Silver rabbit, Daffodil looked more like a wild hare than any domestic bunny I’d ever seen, and I was instantly smitten.Once my adoption application was approved, I scooped Daffy up, jumped in a cab and headed uptown to my one-bedroom apartment in Harlem, prepared to give her the best “forever home” possible.First and foremost, that meant giving her all the space, freedom and companionship she would need. In other words, no cage, plenty of room to roam and, soon, a new best friend: Daisy, a two-and-a-half-pound Himalayan rabbit I adopted three months later from the Center for Avian and Exotic Medicine in Manhattan.And so I set to work turning a 4-by-9-foot walk-in closet outside my bedroom into a bunny room. I filled it with plenty of hiding spots, toys, litter boxes (domestic rabbits can be litter box-trained), a bi-level bunny condo and a little four-poster bed. I painted grass and flowers on the walls and hung art. I hoped all of this would make the room feel warm and safe to the bunnies.It felt like the obvious thing to do for any loved one under my roof, four-legged or not. In fact, it seemed so natural that I began to wonder what other kinds of dedicated pet spaces animal lovers might have made for their pets. If I, with my limited funds and square footage, had devoted a room — albeit a very small one — to my furry friends, what kinds of over-the-top spaces were animal enthusiasts with larger budgets creating for their pets?With a little research, I discovered such efforts could range from a living room wall transformed into a cat jungle gym to an entire studio apartment dedicated to a family of pets, including three parrots, a feral cat and a 35-year-old tortoise. Many animal lovers in New York and beyond, it seems, think nothing of the cost involved in creating a special space for their pets — even when that sort of customization might cut into the profits when it comes time to sell their homes.Hunt Slonem, an artist celebrated for his whimsical paintings of animals (particularly bunnies), carved 1,200 square feet out of his 30,000-square-foot studio in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, for his bird family.Mr. Slonem has kept birds as pets for most of his life, and he currently has about 60 of them, all rescues, including a 75-year-old macaw called Sebastian and a cockatoo named Clyde that follows him everywhere.The space he has devoted to the birds features dozens of suspended cages, often left open so the birds can fly free, and tile imported from Nicaragua that Mr. Slonem said helps to “define the space and stylishly conceal the droppings.”Inside this indoor avian community, Mr. Slonem’s birds are free to talk, spat and mate — some for life, as they see fit. The space is so open and accommodating that many of the more social birds, including a close-knit clique of Amazon parrots, make regular house calls to each other’s cages. Feeding the birds, which takes up to five hours a day, requires the full-time services of a professional bird minder who has worked for Mr. Slonem for 35 years and who serves them a fresh salad of leafy greens, melons, bananas, grapes and tofu.In Mr. Slonem’s latest book, “Birds,” he describes them as his muses and confidantes. He regularly paints among them, and whenever he is within earshot of the aviary, he said, the birds begin to chant his name in unison. “They’re as smart as three-year-olds,” Mr. Slonem said. “And they have huge personalities. They’re my dear friends, a relief from the humdrum of life.”While Mr. Slonem shares his sprawling studio with the birds, he hasn’t given up any of his own living space. But other New Yorkers have.In New York by Gehry building in Manhattan, Lucy Swift Weber’s 10-year-old Yorkie, Chauncey, is recovering from cancer. When things got particularly rough last year, Ms. Weber decided to convert the guest bedroom in her two-bedroom apartment into Chauncey’s room, to “give him the space to heal.”Along with an en-suite bathroom — good for quick water refills and easy cleanup — the dog’s bedroom has a set of customized pet stairs, a plush floor-pillow lounge and a six-foot-tall headboard that Ms. Weber upholstered in a fabric she designed herself. “It’s become this warm, comfortable world where Chauncey can relax and rehabilitate,” Ms. Weber said. “I tried to make the room both calming and cheerful enough that he would want to spend time there, and it worked. He’s in there all of the time by choice.”But even once he is in better health, Ms. Weber said, Chauncey will continue to have a room of his own; she and her boyfriend just moved into a larger, three-bedroom apartment on another floor of the same building, so that her boyfriend’s college-age sons won’t have to sleep in Chauncey’s room when they visit.Caroline Stern, who owns three condos on the same floor of her building on Central Park West, went a step further and dedicated an entire 650-square-foot studio to her pets, where they can sleep and roam free when they’re not with her.Next door to Ms. Stern’s apartment, the pet condo is home to three parrots — Apricot, Sinbad and Roxanne (a Moluccan cockatoo that serves as an emotional support animal) — a feral cat named Butch and an Russian tortoise named Alberta.To accommodate these animals, Ms. Stern filled the condo with hand-built oversized aviaries, towering bird trees and an ultraviolet-lighted reptile area with a special water bath for Alberta. “Birds are loud,” Ms. Stern said. “It’s comforting to have a soothing place to put them when I can’t deal with the screaming.”Ms. Stern’s neighbors are more than aware of her pet condo, but for the most part, she said, they are more charmed than perturbed. “It’s an animal-friendly building,” she said. “People stop by to visit; they know they’re lucky pets.”Such devotion raises an obvious question: When designing extravagant spaces for pets, is property value even worth taking into consideration? As adorable as some of these animal rooms are, they often come at a hefty real estate cost.“Whether it’s for a person or a parrot, customizing a property always makes it more difficult to sell,” said Ryan Serhant, of Nest Seeker’s Serhant Team. “An animal-dedicated space makes it even more challenging, because they often leave behind lingering smells and damaged surfaces that scare prospective buyers into thinking they’d have to renovate.”There are, however, less expensive and less intrusive ways to create inviting pet habitats.In Penfield, N.Y., Jill Sanders sacrificed a single wall in her 15-foot-wide living room to accommodate Nadia, a one-year-old Siberian cat she has been fostering for the last seven months and plans to adopt. Three months ago, when Mrs. Sanders decided to bring home two puppies, she knew she would have to get creative to keep Nadia comfortable. So she called on Mike Wilson and Megan Hanneman, founders of Catastrophic Creations, to devise a dedicated space for Nadia along the living room wall, where the cat could play and escape from the dogs when necessary.More than 10 feet tall and five feet off the ground, the cat playground is composed of several floating sisal post steps, scratching posts, landing shelves, canvas hammocks and a rope bridge. “Everyone that sees it is blown away by its design-savviness,” Mrs. Sanders said. “I just wanted to give her something that brought her as much joy as she brings our family.”And in Chicago, Guita Griffiths enlisted the help of Shelley Johnstone, of Shelley Johnstone Design, to create a practical but comforting place for Margaux, her 70-pound yellow Labrador retriever, in her 110-square-foot mudroom.“Margaux’s a big dog,” Mrs. Griffiths said. “We needed a space to keep her when guests came over, where she wouldn’t feel trapped or anxious.” The result is a 5-by-8-foot space devoted entirely to the 3-year-old dog.Along with luxuries like heated marble floors, an overstuffed dog bed and canine-printed wallpaper, the room has a spacious sink for Margaux’s baths, storage for her leashes and toys, and a Dutch door, so she can be shut inside without feeling claustrophobic.And why not?As Mrs. Griffiths said, “Margaux is just like any other member of our family.”
Revised Data Shows Community Colleges Have Been Underappreciated A college degree is the key to unlocking many of the best careers in the modern labor market. But more than 20 million working-age adults in the United States are college dropouts, failed in some way by institutions that collectively receive hundreds of billions of dollars in public funding every year.For the last few decades, the Department of Education has tracked graduation rates at colleges. Although a handful of elite colleges have graduation rates above 90 percent, many are below 50 percent — often, far below. But colleges have long complained that the federal rates are inaccurate. Back in 2008, Congress directed the department to study the matter.Two years later (the wheels of government turn slowly), the 15-person Committee on Measures of Student Success convened. I was a member. So was Wayne Burton, the president of North Shore Community College in Danvers, Mass. Over several months, Mr. Burton argued forcefully that his college was a lot better than federal graduation rates suggested. The committee decided he was on to something, and recommended that the Education Department calculate graduation rates in a new way.Six more years went by (there was a lot going on). Then this month the Education Department released the revised set of graduation rates. It turns out that Mr. Burton, who has since retired from academia and joined New Hampshire’s citizen legislature, was right all along.The new data suggests that some community colleges are doing a much better job of preparing students for future success than they’ve gotten credit for. Lawmakers and students may want to take a fresh look at them as an affordable starting point on the road toward a college degree. (You can look up rates for each college here.)The old graduation measures date to the late 1980s, when Senator Bill Bradley championed legislation requiring colleges to report graduation rates for their basketball and football players — and, while they were at it, everyone else.The measures were limited to students who enroll in college for the first time and take a full course load. This is a perfectly reasonable way to measure graduation rates at Mr. Bradley’s alma mater, Princeton, because nearly all undergraduates there start full-time, a few months after finishing high school.The federal graduation rates also calculated the percentage of students who graduated within six years of enrollment. This made sense for four-year universities, where the vast majority of bachelor’s degrees are earned within six years.The problem was that the graduation rate rules were then applied to the entire higher education system, including two-year community colleges, where nearly half of all undergraduates begin. The typical community college student isn’t a fresh-faced 18-year-old taking a full slate of courses.Most community college students are nontraditional — adults, parents, people with full-time jobs, people returning to school after years away. They often enroll part-time, taking longer to graduate than the three years the Education Department used to gauge the success of people pursuing two-year degrees. Many community college students also transfer to four-year colleges before finishing a degree — a good result, but one that wasn’t counted for graduation rates.So, following the committee’s lead, education officials made several changes. They included part-time and returning students in the calculation. They extended the time period to eight years. And they made separate calculations of how many students transferred before graduation, and how many were still in college.The results paint a very different picture of community college success. The old measures, for example, captured about 620,000 students who began as first-time, full-time freshmen in 2008. Only 20 percent graduated from the community college they started at within three years. North Shore Community College was typical — its old graduation rate was 19 percent.Such dire numbers became fodder for people defending for-profit colleges from heavy criticism of their high cost and poor outcomes. In 2014, Steve Gunderson, head of the main for-profit college trade association, wrote: “Our institutions have a 63% graduation rate in our two-year programs, while our colleagues at comparable public institutions — community colleges — have a graduation rate of 20%.”The new graduation rates, by contrast, captured more than 1.5 million community college students. Even though that group included more than 710,000 part-time students, who are often less likely to graduate, extending the time frame to eight years increased the average graduation rate to 27 percent.But transfers are where community colleges really shine. Some 510,000 students transferred before graduating, bringing the combined graduation and transfer rate up to 60 percent.Including all of the part-time and returning students and looking over eight years boosted North Shore’s graduation rate to 35 percent. Another 19 percent transferred before graduation. Others were still working toward a degree. All told, more than half of Mr. Burton’s students had a successful outcome — not, as the old rates suggested, fewer than one in five.The for-profit picture is not so rosy. The two-year programs Mr. Gunderson chose for comparison make up less than one-fifth of all for-profit enrollment. Four-year programs at for-profits have much lower graduation rates than those of comparable public institutions. Combined, they had a 34 percent graduation rate under the old measures. And in contrast with community colleges, the new measures make for-profits look worse, dropping their average graduation rate to 32 percent.For-profit students seldom bring their credits elsewhere. Including transfer students increases the average for-profit success rate to just 39 percent, compared with 60 percent at community colleges.In other words, Mr. Gunderson had it backward. The new measures suggest that community colleges are much more successful than for-profit colleges, not much less. They are also far cheaper and leave the average student with much less debt.Some for-profit results are catastrophic. Take South University, a Savannah, Ga.-based for-profit college. In 2008, it enrolled 12,233 new students in its online degree programs — more than the University of Georgia and Georgia State University combined. The old measures show South University Online with a mind-boggling 2.4 percent graduation rate. But, as with community colleges, most South University Online students are nontraditional. What happens when all the students are counted over a full eight years?Answer: The graduation rate increases to just 7.8 percent. Add in transfers? 8.1 percent. Include those still enrolled? 8.5 percent. Three years after leaving college, only 23 percent of South University Online students have paid back even a dollar on the principal of their student loans, probably because nearly all of them failed to earn a degree.Despite these results, South University Online remains accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the same body whose response to a multidecade academic cheating scandal at the University of North Carolina was to put the campus on probation for a single year.By comparison, the graduation rate of Georgia Northwestern Technical College, a public school, increases to 50 percent from 25 percent using the new measures. Preparing students to transfer falls to regional public universities in Georgia, instead of community colleges. Savannah State University has only a 33 percent eight-year graduation rate. But include transfer students, and its success rate rises to 81.2 percent.Not all community colleges look better. San Jose City College in California, which graduates 19 percent of traditional students within three years, sees its graduation rate drop to 18 percent when part-time and returning students are included, even when the time frame is extended to eight years. Transfers improve the success rate only to 21 percent. Most students at San Jose City College are falling short. Many community colleges have room to improve.But the big picture shows that community colleges were unfairly tarred by the old graduation rates. The results produced by including all students — and by looking over the right time frame and accounting for transfers — suggest that many prospective undergraduates may benefit from giving their local community college another look when searching for an affordable path to a diploma. And lawmakers who have typically underfunded community colleges may want to direct more resources to institutions that are doing a difficult job better than we knew.
How a Republican Idea for Reducing Medicare Costs Could Affect You Last month, as Republican leaders were preoccupied with another unsuccessful attempt to replace Obamacare, a senior Trump administration official issued a warning about a different major medical program, Medicare.The official, Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, wrote in The Wall Street Journal  that Medicare was facing a fiscal crisis. She announced that she was asking the agency’s innovation center for ideas to address it, and that part of the answer was to give consumers “incentives to be cost-conscious.” This has some Democrats worried that she’s trying to move Medicare toward something called premium support, which would be a huge change for consumers.Before we get into the pros and cons, what’s the fiscal crisis? According to projections from this year’s Medicare Trustees’ report, the fund that pays for Medicare-financed hospital care will be depleted in 12 years, and care for other services will consume an ever-larger share of the economy and federal revenue. Citing trends like those, Republicans included the outlines of a Medicare premium support plan  in the House of Representatives’ fiscal year 2018 budget resolution, as they did in several prior ones.In broad terms, “premium support” means the government pays a contribution toward premiums, and beneficiaries pay the rest. In a sense, today’s Medicare program already has such a structure. For either the traditional program or a private Medicare Advantage plan, the government pays a preset premium stipend (alternatively called a subsidy, credit or voucher) that varies across these two parts of the program. In all cases, stipends grow at the rate of health care costs.If Medicare already has a form of a premium support model, what’s all the fuss about?The important difference is in how stipend levels are set. Today’s stipends are not driven by the market, but are set according to legislatively established formulas. But the type of premium support Medicare reformers usually advocate — what people generally mean when they use this term — would use market signals to set stipend levels.“Premium support could result in increased efficiency in the Medicare program,” said Bryan Dowd, a health economist at the University of Minnesota, and co-author of a book that analyzed various premium support options. That efficiency could push the hospital trust fund depletion date further into the future and reduce “the financial burden on future generations.”Premium support models take many forms, but there are two crucial variables. One is how stipend levels are set, which determines how much of beneficiaries’ own money they need to contribute. The other key feature of premium support is how much the stipend grows over time. Both aspects are hotly debated.In some versions of premium support, the stipend level would grow more slowly than health care costs, forcing people to pay more out of pocket over time to purchase coverage. In other versions, the stipend level would grow at the same rate as health care costs, so beneficiaries would continue to pay about the same share of their own money for health insurance.Most premium support approaches would retain traditional Medicare, though its fate would be uncertain, a source of controversy. “A lot rides on how the government’s support level differentially impacts the cost to beneficiaries of private plans versus traditional Medicare,” said Timothy McBride, a health economist with Washington University in St. Louis. Geography also plays a role. “If traditional Medicare is disadvantaged, that would hit rural beneficiaries harder, because a larger share of rural America relies on the traditional program than do urban Americans.”As a report this month from the Congressional Budget Office reveals, how much premium support could save the government varies considerably depending on how stipend levels are established. Across the variations the C.B.O. examined, Medicare spending could fall by as much as 9 percent or as little as about 0.5 percent. But premiums could rise, including the premium for traditional Medicare. Under one projection, the C.B.O. estimates, traditional Medicare’s premium could double.In all the scenarios the C.B.O. analyzed, stipend levels would be based on bids from Medicare Advantage plans and traditional Medicare that reflect the cost to cover a person for standard Medicare services. Stipend levels would keep pace with overall health care costs, but they could still be lower than what many Medicare beneficiaries receive today.For example, tying the stipend to the second-lowest bid and requiring all Medicare beneficiaries to be subject to that new, lower level would save $419 billion over 2022-2026, the C.B.O. estimated.Tying it to the average bid or requiring only new beneficiaries to be subject to the new stipend would save less. In either case, people would have access to plans that don’t cost more than today’s. But those who opted for more expensive plans because they offer more benefits, or the traditional program because it covers any doctor willing to accept Medicare patients, would pay more out of pocket. Consequently, more people would opt for cheaper, private plans — and fewer would choose traditional Medicare.This worries some health policy experts. “Traditional Medicare has been the leader in reforming the health care payment and delivery system to improve efficiency,” said Paul Van de Water, senior fellow with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “It has outperformed private insurance in holding down the growth of health costs, but its ability to continue to do that would shrink significantly if premium support caused its enrollment to dwindle.”Exactly how much more people would pay depends not only on the plans they select, but also on where they live. In some markets, many plans, including the traditional program, might charge premiums close to the second-lowest bid. In others, plans that many beneficiaries may want might cost a lot more.In the premium support debate, there’s a fundamental lesson: It’s conceptually simple to reduce federal spending on health care, but it’s very hard to do so in a way that doesn’t increase costs for at least some consumers. To actually reduce total (not just federal) health care spending for everyone, one has to overhaul how care is delivered, not just how it is paid for. That’s much harder.
When Silver Costs More Than Gold: How Trump’s Actions Have Scrambled Insurance Prices The rates for next year’s Obamacare plans are out, and they show how President Trump’s actions have scrambled the insurance marketplace.Usually, plans known as gold have higher monthly premiums but lower out-of-pocket costs than “silver” plans, which have tended to cost less each month and have been the most popular plans.But this month, Mr. Trump carried out a longstanding threat and ended certain subsidies for insurers. To compensate for the lost funding, insurers increased the prices of their plans — heavily in the silver category and less so in others.Now the silver plans will be more expensive in many markets than gold plans that have much lower deductibles. For people who qualify for government subsidies, that’s good news: Their subsidies will rise with the rising cost of silver plans, and they’ll be able to afford a plan that requires much less out-of-pocket spending for their health care. For those who don’t, it highlights just how expensive many silver plans have gotten as a result of the president’s action, and how hard people may need to work to find an affordable option.The least expensive gold option for next year is cheaper than the least expensive silver option in about a sixth of counties using Healthcare.Gov to market plans, as you can see on our map. Gold is a better option in much of New Mexico, Wyoming, Kansas, and parts of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Georgia. There are also a substantial number of counties in Texas, Florida, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Michigan where the price difference between a gold plan and a silver plan with a much higher deductible is smaller than $25 a month.That is confusing, and consumers are likely to be surprised when the enrollment period opens on Wednesday.The Trump administration created this pricing chaos by eliminating cost-sharing subsidies, a payment to insurance companies that was tied up in a legal dispute. But it has also taken steps to limit the damage. It permitted states and insurers to change their prices at the last minute to compensate for the change. It made price information for next year publicly available a week early, so customers could have more time to window-shop and explore their options.It also organized plans on its site in order of their premium price, so that customers who live in a place where a gold plan costs less than the cheapest silver plan would have an easier time figuring that out.If you live in one of the places where the gold plan is cheaper than the silver plan, and you earn more than about $24,000, you should not buy the more expensive silver option. The gold plan will cost less, and have a lower deductible. There are also high-deductible bronze plans that will have substantially lower premiums that you may also want to consider. If you qualify for a government subsidy, those will be your best options.If you earn too much to qualify for federal help buying insurance, you should also steer clear of the more expensive silver plans on HealthCare.gov. But there may be cheaper options in the silver category if you buy directly from an insurance company. A broker may be able to help you examine all of those options.If you earn less than $24,000, a silver plan will still be your best choice. That’s because you qualify for additional discounts that will lower your deductible and co-payment, making a silver plan even more generous than a gold plan. Premium subsidies, which are unaffected by the president’s actions, will protect you from premium price increases.The loading of cost increases onto silver plans also makes it hard to easily describe how much more expensive insurance will be next year, compared with this year. The consulting group Avalere Health published a report Wednesday saying that the average silver plan on HealthCare.gov would increase in price by 34 percent — by far the largest annual price increase since the Obamacare markets began.Normally, that silver price increase is a good barometer for what’s happening with the entire health insurance market. But the Avalere report highlighted that the prices of other plan types aren’t rising as fast. Gold plans are going up, on average, by 16 percent. Bronze plans are rising, on average, by 18 percent.Some of those increases are probably because of Trump administration actions as well. The government has cut back on advertising and outreach to help enroll healthy customers, and has signaled that it may not enforce the government mandate to obtain insurance as vigorously as the Obama administration did. In their filings with regulators, insurance companies said they were increasing premiums to address that broader policy uncertainty.Our map draws on prices that were published online Wednesday for 2018 plans on HealthCare.gov. The website serves 39 states, and the precise prices we examined were for single customers who don’t smoke, age 40, though the trends should be the same for customers with different family sizes and ages. Information from the remaining states, which run their own marketplaces, will become available next week.

Subaru Admits Inspection Failings, in Another Blow to Japan’s Carmakers TOKYO — The automaker Subaru was caught up in a furor on Friday about improperly conducted vehicle inspections, the second such issue to hit a Japanese vehicle manufacturer in less than a month.The revelation, which follows a similar admission from Nissan, comes at a time when Japan’s automobile industry — normally known for its precise engineering and exacting quality standards — is under unusually intense scrutiny.Takata, a major supplier of safety equipment to car manufacturers around the world, declared bankruptcy in June after airbags it produced exploded, causing deaths and injuries and prompting the largest auto safety recall in history, involving tens of millions of vehicles.Mitsubishi Motors and Suzuki Motor said last year that they had been exaggerating the fuel economy of their vehicles by cheating on tests. And most recently, Kobe Steel, whose metals are used in cars, trains and airplanes, admitted this month that it had manipulated data to make aluminum and other metals it supplied appear stronger than they really were.Subaru said it had allowed unqualified workers to perform quality checks on cars produced for the Japanese market. It said it was preparing to recall 255,000 vehicles in Japan to have them reinspected by qualified employees, a process it said would cost 5 billion yen, or about $44 million. The cars include the Toyota 86, a sports model jointly produced by Subaru and Toyota.“I’m distressed that our company is responsible for something that could cast doubt on the quality of Japanese manufacturing,” Yasuyuki Yoshinaga, chief executive of Subaru Corporation, said at a news conference on Friday. “This will be reported around the world.”The inspection problem involves final quality checks that automakers perform on vehicles before they leave factories for dealerships.After a car rolls off an assembly line, workers look it over and run it on rollers to ensure it is in working order. Points on their checklists include: Do the seats adjust properly? Do the headlights shine at the correct angle? Does the speedometer work accurately?Such checks are a standard part of automobile manufacturing. But in Japan, the law requires that carmakers produce a special certificate for every vehicle to show it has passed examination; only then can it be registered as road worthy.Government guidelines specify that workers who conduct these inspections must be “qualified” — though the authorities leave the details up to manufacturers. The car companies have the responsibility of deciding what training is required and of authorizing employees to work as qualified inspectors.Nissan and Subaru stumbled on that step. They allowed some workers who had not completed training programs or who had not been formally authorized to be “final inspectors” to perform the checks.The corner-cutting appears to have been long-established. Subaru said company rules designating who was allowed to inspect cars had been inconsistent with government guidelines for 30 years. Nissan says it is still investigating the scope and duration of its failure, but several news reports have suggested that it too may have been using unqualified inspectors for decades.Independent specialists say it is unlikely that the inspection practices resulted in unsafe cars.Automotive manufacturers and their suppliers perform multiple safety tests during development and production, and serious but hard-to-find faults — say, unstable chemicals inside an airbag inflater, which are believed to have caused the Takata hazard — are unlikely to be spotted by a limited, mostly external once-over.Some commentators have suggested that part of the blame belongs with Japanese regulators, whose guidelines regarding inspectors appear simultaneously burdensome and vague. Cars made for export are not subject to the same rules, because governments outside Japan do not require final vehicle inspections to be carried out by workers with special training and qualifications.“The checks are a formality, and it would not be an exaggeration to say they require no special know-how,” Hisao Inoue, a veteran Japanese automotive journalist, wrote on the website of the magazine Gendai Business after the initial admission by Nissan.He said the inspection regulations should be reviewed, though he added that it was “absolutely wrong” for Nissan to have broken the rules.Yoshio Tsukuda, founder of the Tsukuda Mobility Research Institute, an auto industry study firm, said Nissan and Subaru had risked their reputations and shown a disregard for following the rules, but had probably not endangered their customers.“It makes you question how well they are managing what’s happening on the factory floor,” Mr. Tsukuda said. “Even if there is not a safety problem, users of their products will feel uneasy.”Mr. Tsukuda said a shrinking car market in Japan may have increased the temptation to cheat. The country’s automakers are selling more and more vehicles abroad, as demand at home declines because of Japan’s falling population. Nissan, for instance — a particularly foreign-focused producer — sells 90 percent of its cars outside Japan.That increases the cost, relative to sales, of complying with domestic-only rules — in this case by putting workers through special courses to become authorized inspectors, a process that can take them away from their normal duties over a period of weeks or even months.“The Japan market is becoming an afterthought,” Mr. Tsukuda said.The carmakers’ crisis management capabilities are now being tested.In particular, critics have complained that Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan’s chief executive, failed to show sufficient contrition at a news conference about the company’s lapse. In a country where apologies are highly ritualized, even his bow — briefer and shallower than those of most executives seeking the public’s forgiveness — became a target of criticism.Subaru, which is one of Japan’s smaller carmakers, with production of about one million vehicles a year, said that 245 workers in Japan were authorized to conduct final vehicle inspections. It said a much smaller group of employees — between four and 17 at any given time — who were studying to be inspectors but had not yet qualified, would also certify vehicles, contrary to government guidelines.Those junior workers would mark inspection certificates using the name stamps of qualified supervisors, Subaru said.“It was not our intention to deceive anyone, but what we did was not appropriate,” Mr. Yoshinaga said. “Rules are rules.”
Cost of Volkswagen Scandal Could Hurt Company’s Electric Vehicle Push FRANKFURT — Volkswagen has vowed to be the company that will make electric cars affordable for the masses.But an earnings report published on Friday showed how the cost of an emissions scandal could interfere with those plans.Net profit in the third quarter fell about 50 percent, to 1.1 billion euros, or $1.3 billion, after the company set aside €2.6 billion to cover the unexpectedly high cost of repairing diesel cars in the United States that contained illegal emissions-cheating software. The automaker had warned last month that the emissions scandal would cut into earnings.One way that Volkswagen was able to still report a profit in the quarter, though, was by cutting spending on research and development. That may not be a wise strategy during what Matthias Müller, the chief executive of Volkswagen, described in a statement Friday as a “profound structural transformation” in the auto industry.Traditional car companies are spending heavily to develop battery-powered and self-driving cars while still maintaining their lineups of cars with internal combustion engines. Supporting both old and new technologies is expensive, and it puts companies like Volkswagen, Ford or General Motors at a disadvantage compared with new companies like Tesla, which builds only electric vehicles.Volkswagen has announced ambitious plans to offer a lineup of battery-powered vehicles beginning in late 2019 that would be affordable for middle-class buyers. Herbert Diess, the head of the division that makes Volkswagen brand cars, has said that he sees Tesla as a more important competitor than traditional rivals like Toyota.The German company aims to deploy its enormous manufacturing network to churn out battery-powered cars faster, and in greater volume, than Tesla, which has had trouble meeting demand. But those plans may be difficult to reconcile with cuts in the research and development budget.The diesel scandal remains a dead weight on the company’s finances and reputation. Volkswagen said Friday that legal settlements and other costs related to the emissions cheating have drained €14.5 billion this year from company coffers. That is money that Volkswagen would certainly prefer to spend developing new products.Volkswagen might be able to find savings in other areas, for example, by diverting money that could have been used to develop new diesel engines, said Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive Management at the Fachhochschule der Wirtschaft, a technical university in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.Still, Mr. Bratzel said, “it really hurts that this money is gone and is not available for the future.”The damage from the scandal, Volkswagen said in a statement, was “nowhere near an end and would continue to necessitate great efforts throughout the entire group.”Andreas Hoffbauer, a Volkswagen spokesman, said the company was responding to investors who have long complained that the research and development budget was spent inefficiently and was too large compared with rivals’ budgets.The good news for the carmaker was that sales in the third quarter rose 6 percent, to €55 billion, thanks in part to a new SUV model introduced in the United States and economic recovery in Latin America.But there were also signs of trouble. In Germany, where Volkswagen has long dominated the market for affordable cars, sales fell 2 percent even as most competitors recorded sales gains. The company acknowledged that it has suffered from a buyer backlash against diesel, long one of its strongest selling points.In a reflection of growing anger in Germany toward Volkswagen, despite its position as a pillar of the economy, the number of lawsuits by aggrieved diesel owners has almost tripled to 4,600, the company said. Unlike the United States, Germany does not allow class-action suits by owners, who take a considerable financial risk by suing Volkswagen as individuals.Volkswagen sales in Western Europe, its core market, rose 1 percent. But the overall market in the region rose faster and the company’s share has slipped so far this year.The company acknowledged in the earnings report that one reason for the mediocre performance in Europe was “the fact that customer confidence has not yet been fully restored following the diesel issue and to customer uncertainty generated by the public discussion on driving bans for diesel vehicles.”London’s city government this week began imposing a daily charge of 10 pounds, or $13.20, on older diesel cars to drive in the city center, on top of the existing congestion charge of £11.50 per day. Other cities like Stuttgart and Munich are also considering restrictions on diesels, which are blamed for high levels of harmful nitrogen oxides.In a positive development, Volkswagen made more money from its namesake brand than it did last year. Operating profit from cars with the VW logo doubled to €2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2017 compared with the same period a year earlier.But the company remains dependent on its luxury brands Audi and Porsche, which generated more than twice as much profit, even though they sell fewer cars. Audi sales have slipped this year, also an ominous sign.
Automakers Build War Chests to Finance a Self-Driving Future DETROIT — Detroit’s Big Three automakers are showing a new sense of bottom-line discipline as they angle for any advantage in the race with Silicon Valley, and one another, to develop the cars of the future.This week, the companies — General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler — reported earnings that highlighted the underlying strengths in their basic business of building mass-market vehicles, particularly hot-selling trucks and sport-utility vehicles.Ford was the latest to weigh in, announcing Thursday that robust sales of its bellwether F-series pickup had fueled a $1.6 billion profit for the third quarter, a 63 percent increase over the same period a year ago.And like General Motors and Fiat Chrysler, which reported their results earlier in the week, Ford needs to keep squeezing more profits from mainstream products to finance the new technology necessary for electric and self-driving models.“We have a clear path to leverage what we’ve done historically,” said Jim Hackett, who became Ford’s chief executive five months ago. “Our first priority is to restore revenue and attack costs.”Mr. Hackett’s predecessor, Mark Fields, was ousted in May after he failed to deliver the high-tech strategy that investors were eager to see for future growth.Mr. Hackett has reorganized his management team with an eye toward incremental improvements in the more mundane aspects of the business, such as cutting material costs and streamlining production, as a prelude to making larger investments in electric-powered models driven by computers. It also announced a long list of senior management appointments and departures this week.“We are committed to transforming our business,” Mr. Hackett said of his company’s efforts to bring new driverless technology to market. Yet he seemed most proud on Thursday that Ford had achieved 8 percent operating margins on vehicles it builds and sells in the North American market.That is the type of performance that the Detroit companies must achieve to win over investors, who remain leery of the domestic manufacturers because of their roller-coaster financial histories.It was just eight years ago that both G.M. and the former Chrysler needed bankruptcies and government bailouts simply to survive.For its part, Ford weathered the last recession without the benefit of Chapter 11 or federal aid — but only after it borrowed heavily and sold off divisions to generate the capital it needed to stay alive.Now all three manufacturers are committed to reining in costs, aligning production volumes with demand, and reducing unprofitable sales of slow-moving vehicles to corporate fleets and rental-car companies. The Chrysler half of the Italian-American company Fiat Chrysler has gone a step further by dropping most small and midsize passenger cars from its lineup.Its focus on Jeep S.U.V.s and Ram pickups helped Fiat Chrysler post record third-quarter earnings of about $1.1 billion, an increase of 50 percent over the same period a year ago.The results drew praise from one analyst because of the company’s aggressive approach to maximizing shareholder value. “Fiat Chrysler has continued a relentless restructuring of its brand portfolio to de-emphasize areas where it couldn’t make money,” the analyst, Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note.The earnings announcements this week were welcomed on Wall Street, with Ford’s shares gaining almost 2 percent on Thursday.But attacking costs and shifting investment to more popular products may not be enough for automakers to sustain strong profits if market conditions continue to weaken.Overall sales of new vehicles in the United States have fallen about 2 percent so far this year, after back-to-back record years. An overhaul or abandonment of the North American Free Trade Agreement — which is being renegotiated by the United States, Canada and Mexico — could also upset the delicate balance of production and parts manufacturing spread over the region.Competition is also getting stiffer, as companies such as the Japanese automaker Nissan expand their S.U.V. lineups and underperforming automakers like the German giant Volkswagen rev up their expansion plans.Still, the healthy profit reports out of Detroit are becoming a proof point that the major domestic carmakers are better prepared than ever for a longer-term downturn in demand.Some of the biggest changes are underway at G.M., the nation’s largest automaker. The company has made major moves in recent months, such as selling its unprofitable Opel-Vauxhall unit in Europe. Moreover, G.M. slashed its third-quarter production in North America by about 25 percent to respond to weak demand for many of its passenger car models.The company reported a loss of $3 billion for the quarter, mostly because it is still absorbing hefty charges for the sale of the European assets to the French carmaker PSA Group. But G.M. reported 8 percent profit margins on vehicles it did sell in its home market, and pledged to stay focused on selling fewer, but higher-priced, vehicles.G.M.’s chief financial officer, Chuck Stevens, told analysts on a conference call that the results demonstrated “the resilience of our core business” in the face of declining consumer demand. “This was a solid quarter even with significantly lower volumes,” he said.But as overall sales in the United States continue to slowly erode, the companies must maintain discipline on production schedules and refrain from piling sales incentives on poor-performing models. “The market is more challenging than expected,” Mr. Stevens said.Strong balance sheets are essential if the automakers are going to dedicate more spending and resources to expensive strategies for self-driving and electric cars. G.M., for example, is continuing to build on its acquisition of the software firm Cruise Automation in its efforts to put fully autonomous vehicles on the road.The company recently acquired a small laser-imaging company to augment Cruise’s work on outfitting all-electric Chevrolet Bolts with the most advanced self-driving equipment. And G.M. is building more Bolts for autonomous-driving tests in New York and elsewhere.Mary T. Barra, G.M.’s chief executive, told analysts that the company was also looking at potential markets for self-driving vehicles outside the United States. “Absolutely, we are going to be looking globally,” she said.And even Fiat Chrysler, which has been slow to join the race to develop autonomous vehicles, served notice that it was now in position to accelerate its self-driving program in partnership with the German automaker BMW and suppliers like Delphi and Intel.“We’re not laggards here,” the company’s chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, said on an analyst call. “We’ve just chosen our spot carefully before we started playing.”
The Feminist Pioneers Making Provocative Art About Sex THIS SUMMER IN LOS ANGELES, a hairy, phallic-looking screw painted by Judith Bernstein extended across 180 feet of the exterior of Venus gallery in Boyle Heights. This month at MoMA PS1 in Queens, men and women stripped down to their underwear and rubbed each other with raw fish in a video by Carolee Schneemann. And in London, pink double-headed phalluses bloomed from cacti in Renate Bertlmann’s sculptures at the Frieze art fair.X-rated art is, of course, nothing new. Depictions of sex have been accepted throughout history and across cultures, from Japan’s 17th-century Shunga prints to Gustave Courbet’s 1866 closeup portrait of a vagina, “The Origin of the World,” or Picasso’s 1907 “Les Demoiselles d’Avignon.” In the 1960s, Tom Wesselmann’s flat, affectless paintings of hard-nippled, open-mouthed women lying on their backs were Pop Art pioneers. Andy Warhol’s “Blue Movie,” featuring extended sex scenes by the performers Viva and Louis Waldon, received theatrical release in America in 1969, blurring the line between art and erotica.But though these works may have been greeted with varying levels of controversy — Courbet’s work remains so shocking that a book cover bearing its image was removed from shop windows by the French police in 1994 — what they shared was not only a dedication to redefining what was explicit for their respective ages and cultures, but a perspective as well: This was art about sex, but only as was made by, or erotic to, straight men. (Even “Blue Movie,” by the openly gay Warhol, did little more than legitimize pornography — its creation and consumption.) Now, though, some of the most revelatory art on sexual themes is being made by women like Bernstein, Betty Tompkins, Juanita McNeely and Joan Semmel, best known for their paintings, and multidisciplinary artists like Schneemann and Valie Export, among others, all of whom have been producing their work for decades to little notice — if not outright persecution — from critics, curators and audiences.Like their male counterparts, their subject matter is also the body, but unlike some of their proto-feminist foremothers (Georgia O’Keeffe, Agnes Martin, Lee Krasner), they’re concerned not with vaginal flowers or redefining beauty, but with fluids, bulges and secretions. Fellow artists and critics have called them the “blood and guts club” or the “black sheep feminists.” Censored, shunned and banished to obscurity for most of their careers, they’ve been working with remarkable consistency, and it is only now — when these artists are in their 70s, 80s and 90s — that they, and their work, are being embraced as canonical.Their latent recognition is both a reflection of the political moment and a response to it. At a time of renewed debates about consent and gender equality in the workplace as well as the rising power of nativist men’s rights activists — spurred by a president who has a morbid fascination with the visceral functions of the female body — Bernstein, Schneemann and an entire generation of nearly forgotten women who have fearlessly examined sex and gender in their art, whether anyone was paying attention or not, are suddenly more relevant than they’ve ever been.BETTY TOMPKINS, who was born in 1945, tells me, “I became an overnight success at 72.” Her New York studio is crowded with paintings in a long-running series that depict sexual penetrations rendered photorealistically and in extreme closeup — which she started making in 1969. For years, they were at best ignored as lurid curiosities, though the reception was occasionally more severe. In 1973, two of the paintings were seized by French customs when Tompkins was shipping them to Paris for a show. It was a career death sentence; even the bravest venues were reluctant — and arguably still are — to exhibit an artist who alienates patrons or the press. “I was a living nightmare for galleries after that: young, female and censored,” Tompkins says. Today, the Centre Pompidou in Paris has one of these censored works in its permanent collection, a closely cropped, between-the-thighs view of a woman straddling a penis.Part of what makes Tompkins’s work so enduringly potent today, and what made it too shocking for its time, is not just its frank sexuality: It’s that the art of Tompkins, Bernstein and their peers seethes with lust, ego, wisecracks and profanity. While other feminists of their era were embracing “central core” imagery related to the womb or vulva and reclaiming traditionally female crafts like needlepoint, these artists demanded attention the way men did — through shock and awe.Bernstein’s colossal drawings of screws, which unambiguously resemble erect penises, provoked a kind of castration anxiety. “One dealer told me that my work made men of his age feel uncomfortable,” she says. One of her works was censored from a show of women’s art at the Museum of the Philadelphia Civic Center in 1974 after its director, John Pierron, claimed that it “offends me on behalf of the children of this city.” In the late 1960s, a male dealer at Knoedler gallery, then the oldest commercial gallery in New York, told Juanita McNeely that the slides of her work she’d shown him — violent paintings of nude women bleeding — couldn’t have been made by a woman. At another gallery, she brought the canvases to prove it, but as she unrolled them onto the floor the dealer kicked them out of his path and walked away. These artists’ work, at the time and ever since, has been an act of announcement, of provocation by existence. They threatened to take up male territory, which museums and galleries then almost exclusively were.Although most of these women identified (and still do) as feminists, their work was too outré even for the radical feminism of the 1960s and ’70s, which found its focus in the politics of sexual oppression, and its voice in people like the lawyer and activist Catharine MacKinnon, who argued that “all pornography is made under conditions of inequality.” The artists of this generation didn’t quite fit in with anyone — not women (MacKinnon’s stance meant a brief, uneasy alliance between feminism and right-wing censors), not critics and not other artists: At the time that these so-called blood-and-guts artists were first appearing, minimalism, a nearly asexual style that championed form over feeling, was the dominant trend — leagues away from these women’s lusty, leaky, fleshy aesthetic. Feminists criticized Tompkins for cutting and cropping images from her husband’s pornographic magazines and thus perpetuating male sexist fantasies. (“I was not active in the feminist art movement,” she says. “I couldn’t find it. Nobody told me where the meetings were.”) Bernstein, now 75, was a member of the all-woman cooperative gallery A.I.R., which was founded in 1972 and is still active, but she too never felt the movement embraced her. “I observed men and their behavior. A lot of feminists didn’t take that as being feminism.”Especially scandalizing was the fact that many of the women — who are almost exclusively heterosexual — made men the objects of desire. When Sylvia Sleigh’s 1975 portrait of a young nude man went on view at the Bronx Museum, then housed in a room of a courthouse, a judge complained about the “explicit male nudity in the corridor of a public courthouse.” The curator wondered in response why he had never complained before about the “coyly draped, bare-breasted females” that adorned the elevators of the same building.The arrival of queer art in the early ’70s forced the discussion of art and sex — who got to depict it; what it should look like — into the culture at large. Conservatives and the Christian right turned their attention toward gay male artists like Robert Mapplethorpe and David Wojnarowicz, both of whom depicted male desire in their work, and both of whom had been censored by museums. There was a philosophical kinship between these phallic feminists and this first major generation of queer artists, who were all representing anatomy in abrasive ways.But while queer art became a cause for museums and galleries — Mapplethorpe and Wojnarowicz were anointed figureheads in a battle between progressive and conservative values, which ultimately exposed their work to wider audiences — these women artists remained obscure. Mapplethorpe’s solo show featuring photographs of male nudes at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., was canceled in 1989 after pressure from members of Congress, but the exhibition was quickly moved to the Washington Project for the Arts. Crowds lined up to see it, and America’s near-return to the 1950s seemed to have been at least temporarily thwarted. And yet the female artists received no new recognition, no new regard. The third wave of feminists that emerged in the ’90s allied with queer theorists and activists of color — and dismissed the previous generation’s feminism as too straight, white and privileged.NOW, 50 YEARS after these women began making work, the culture has finally caught up to them. These days, pornography streams on phones; many curators determining museum programming came of age reading feminist theory; and there is a diversity, and plurality, of young women artists who have made sex, and the female body, their primary subject, and who have found recognition doing so: 27-year-old Darja Bajagic, who collages hardcore porn with images of murdered women, or 28-year-old Amalia Ulman, whose fictional Instagram personas post selfies in bras and thongs, or 25-year-old Emma Sulkowicz, whose 2014 performance, in which she marched around the campus of Columbia University lugging the mattress on which she was allegedly raped by a fellow student, quickly became an emblem of the current debate surrounding campus sexual assault.But the sudden popularity of Tompkins and Bernstein is not just about the abundance and easy accessibility of explicit material to which we have all become desensitized. Young women today face some of the same battles that were fought by their mothers and grandmothers at a time when these artists were just beginning their careers. January’s Women’s March was a kind of communion of the previous generations of feminism, a present-tense call to action, but it was also an acknowledgment of the past. The signs carried by protesters contained all the iconography that these artists once traded in and still do — all the explicit depictions of male and female anatomy and bodily functions that had once alienated them had become, over time, the symbols of an age of resistance.And while these artists’ shamelessness as young women was outrageous, their shamelessness as old women is revolutionary. What’s perhaps most astonishing is that they never stopped making their work, despite years of disregard: There is something radical about their very stubbornness, their dogged persistence. “In the 1960s and early ’70s, every gallery rejected my work,” says the 78-year-old Carolee Schneemann, who won a lifetime achievement award at this year’s Venice Biennale and is the subject of a retrospective currently on view at PS1. The show was a long time coming. At a notorious 1975 performance at a women’s art festival in East Hampton, Schneemann unrolled a scroll from her vagina and read from it. (The text was about a male “structuralist filmmaker” who criticized the “diaristic indulgence” of her art.) She, like her peers, has bittersweet feelings about their recent recognition. On the one hand, they’re enjoying the success — “Oh my god, it’s fabulous,” Bernstein says. “I take cabs everywhere” — but they’re skeptical of the forces that enabled it. There is a perpetual cycle in the art world of women not being taken seriously until they are old or dead: This was the case with Louise Bourgeois, who only had her first retrospective in 1982, after she turned 70, or the painter Carmen Herrera, who recently had her retrospective at the Whitney ... at the age of 101. These women’s work might be as uncompromising as it ever was, but age, they know, has also neutralized them in men’s eyes, removed some of their sting and danger. Now that they’re postmenopausal, their sexual disobedience doesn’t matter as much to men, who “don’t want to sleep with us anymore,” Schneemann says. “We’re not as threatening as younger women,” says Bernstein.Other things, though, haven’t changed. Bernstein still lives and works in the same Chinatown studio she’s had since 1967, cluttered with a collection of stuffed animals and toys for her two Persian cats. It used to be crammed with decades of unsold paintings, but now that she can finally afford storage space, the only work present on a recent visit was her new series of fluorescent black-light paintings of testicle-headed Donald Trumps and vagina-faced Hillary Clintons, which are now on view at the Drawing Center in downtown Manhattan. Her signature, prominently scrawled in black cursive letters, appears throughout these works. “I want to make sure they know who did it,” she says.
Sight and Insight in the California Desert On my second evening alone in the California high desert, I realize how much I’m looking forward to lighting the glass oil lamp. My home for this scorchingly hot week in June is a one-room cabin without electricity or running water that my host, the artist Andrea Zittel, has purposefully left nearly bare, and I’m craving the flame’s intricate shadow, the only baroque fillip in this spartan interior. As daylight drains from the wide, empty plain outside the uncurtained windows, and the darkness makes the uncanny quiet feel even more silent, I fall into a brief reverie about the human hunger for ornamentation and the expressionlessness of my electric lamps back home. Mundane revelations, perhaps, but insights into the ordinary are the point of living in this spare box tucked into a landscape as strange and sweltering as Venus, with little to occupy me but uninterrupted thoughts about how I conduct every bit of my life, down to the way I brush my teeth or wipe my hands on a dish towel.The 400-square-foot structure, where I have come to try to understand Zittel’s work — and, if her theories are correct, myself as well — is one of a pair she calls “Experimental Living Cabins.” They are the latest addition to her singular oeuvre, called A-Z West — a challenging sprawl of projects that has developed in the 17 years since she left an art career in New York for a lone stucco shack on the edge of ghostly Joshua Tree National Park, some 130 miles east of L.A., where she currently lives full time. What she refers to as her “life practice” now comprises more than 60 acres, including permanent sculpture installations, informal classrooms, shipping container workspaces, dormlike guest quarters and a giant studio with rooms for weaving textiles and crafting rustic clay bowls. The bowls and textiles, collectively known as A-Z West Works, are sold to help keep the whole thing going.Maintaining this small empire has required endless endurance, extreme physical exertion and an obsessive ambition of the sort we associate with the celebrated, largely male land artists of the 1970s who colonized the American desert, among them Walter De Maria, Michael Heizer and Robert Smithson. But while those protean figures are experiencing a renaissance in the public imagination, their works have, in fact, ossified or become commercialized — in New Mexico, De Maria’s “The Lightning Field” (1977), consisting of 400 sharpened steel poles, is run by the Dia Art Foundation as a sleepover site; Heizer’s “City,” begun in 1972 as a mile-and-a-half-long excavation set to be one of the largest sculptures ever made, won’t be visitable or photographable until at least 2020; “Spiral Jetty,” the mammoth pinwheel of mud, salt and rock that Smithson finished in 1970, has spent most of its existence underwater — whereas Zittel’s experiment has, since she conceived it, moved from the theoretical to the vividly animated in a way that few utopian art projects ever do.Like her predecessors, Zittel’s material is also the Southwestern desert, but she isn’t a land artist in the traditional mode: Instead of moving earth with giant machines, or leaving hulking, unpeopled abstractions amid the dust, she employs this vast landscape to explore and challenge the quotidian functions of our existence. She was trained as a sculptor and still considers herself one, but her art is really a kind of philosophical quest, one that involves an ongoing and intense examination of what it means to live: What do we really mean when we say we need shelter, community, clothes, tools, light? How elaborate a space — indeed, how much space, down to the millimeter — do we need to survive, to thrive? What structures best facilitate creativity, serenity, unity?What makes Zittel’s art seem so urgent at this moment is that the culture appears to have caught up to her at last: In our era of rapidly shifting domestic arrangements, nearly everyone — young people living alone or aging couples in communal compounds — seems badly served by architecture designed for the increasingly vestigial nuclear family. The cultish Marie Kondo’s admonitions to cast out the nonessential seems ripped from Zittel’s playbook; the conceptual underpinnings for the swelling phalanx of tiny, modular dwellings that evade byzantine zoning regulations and create a more mobile society can be found in Zittel’s experiments as well.During her nearly two decades in the barren, windswept wasteland, her practice has gone from an isolated curiosity to a complete operational community constructed to outlive her, a “Through the Looking-Glass” laboratory that reflects our contemporary fascination with the spaces in which we live. From ur-furniture that makes even the concept of a chair seem quaint, to vessels that force us to question the notion of a drinking glass, Zittel’s work reminds us that the elemental building blocks of human society are ultimately domestic — and that revolution begins in private.“I don’t want people to be uncomfortable, but I don’t want them to feel comfortable, either,” Zittel tells me. “You know when you’re alone with yourself and you feel jangly and on edge? But in a way that’s the most cathartic thing in the world? Almost painful, but so good?”We are discussing my stay in the “Experimental Living Cabins” — I’m on day four of seven — in the kitchen of Zittel’s home, which is in the center of A-Z West and has, over the years, been expanded from a shack into a chic, colorful oasis filled with her own designs, including 2011’s “Aggregated Stacks” (wall shelves made from plaster-covered cardboard shipping boxes from Amazon) and “Linear Sequence” (2016), a low-to-the-ground sculpture of tabletops and floor cushions that functions as a living room. She shares it with her 13-year-old son, Emmett, and a menagerie that includes three dogs, a cat, six chickens, four rescue pigeons, three rescue tortoises and three fish.Zittel is 52, 5-foot-6, and lanky, with shoulder-length reddish-brown hair she often pulls back in a long braid. For decades, she’s worn the same outfit every day for a predetermined period — she’s been wearing her current one for about three months — an extension of “A-Z Uniforms,” a work she began back in Brooklyn. When I visited, she’d been too busy to finish assembling that summer’s ensemble, so was still in her spring getup — a black sleeveless muscle tee, a floor-length black denim A-line skirt and black Birkenstocks. There were thin black onyx rings on all of her fingers; her bare arms were those of someone who regularly lifts heavy objects. Based on her minimalist, cerebral aesthetic, I’d expected her to be austere and aloof. But as I watched her make the rounds of the property, conferring with assistants and checking on the artists bent over the kiln, she projected a regal serenity, asking questions and waiting patiently for the answer before responding in a cadence she once conceded has a bit of Valley Girl in it. The Brooklyn-based artist Rachel Harrison, who has known Zittel for 20 years, since they both lived in Williamsburg, calls her “legendarily generous,” especially to young artists, several hundred of whom have spent time at A-Z West over the years.But Zittel’s own work is always the soul of the machine. In 2004 she started the “Wagon Station Encampment,” 12 domed aluminum-clad units around a central outdoor kitchen that marry the proportions of a frontier-era covered wagon with the modernity of a Subaru Outback; there is just enough space for one person to sleep or sit up, and a few hooks for personal items. Over the years, during which dozens of artists have stayed in them for weeks at a time, she has assiduously maintained the wagons, two early versions of which are owned by the Guggenheim; from a distance, they gleam like fallen satellites in a lunar terrain. Several months ago, she opened her latest permanent site-specific work, “Planar Pavilions,” a loose grid of 10 configurations of black-painted cinder-block walls of varying heights — some low enough to sit on, others as tall and imposing as linebackers — along a gentle slope, which calls to mind the crumbled foundations of a future civilization as well as the constellation of concrete boxes Donald Judd installed in the early 1980s on his own property in Marfa, Tex.I have driven west to see her from the “Experimental Living Cabins,” set on 15 acres a 40-minute drive away in Wonder Valley, a desolate, unincorporated corner of the Mojave Desert, near the joyless sprawl of Twentynine Palms, home to one of the largest military training areas in the country. Zittel started buying up acreage to add to her holdings several years ago, attracted by the site’s remoteness and the several ramshackle “jackrabbit homesteads” on the property (really, little more than a dusty patch of desert), relics of the Small Tract Act of 1938, which lured pioneers to “prove up” five acres. (The terrain is so inhospitable that few actually stayed.) She now owns three of the cabins, though only two are renovated: simple board-and-batten structures, painted gray with white trim, that stand alone amid the scrub brush, 600 feet apart in the wide, flat basin rimmed in the distance by purpled mountains. She originally intended to use them for herself — ironically, between occasional afternoon visitors and the residents who come for longer stays in exchange for help with site maintenance, A-Z West is such a hive these days that Zittel rarely has the alone time she craves — but like most elements in her life, the cabins have become part of her work, perhaps even the ultimate expression of it.When she bought the land in Wonder Valley, she was in the midst of making a series of sculptures called “Planar Configurations,” based on her longstanding fascination with the “planar panel” — basically, anything that is rectangular, whether a 4-by-8 piece of plywood, a 8½-by-11 sheet of printer paper or a table top. Each sculpture, made of wood, red fiberglass and black-matte aluminum or steel, is a set of interconnected rectangles, like a 3D Mondrian, that function as a table, bed, counter and room divider. Last year, Zittel, always frustrated by how few people actually get to interact with her work, and ever on the lookout for ways to finance her many projects, had a revelation: She could put a “Planar Configuration” inside each of the cabins, and allow people to stay in them, for rates comparable to a nearby Airbnb. It would be the first time that a stranger could reside in Zittel’s universe full time, in utter privacy, in contrast to the “Wagon Station Encampment” with its communal ethos and group activities.The “Experimental Living Cabins,” at which I am one of the first guests, are intended for solo visitors who stay anywhere from two days to three weeks, and though a smattering of boxy one-story houses dot the area, they are so low, and so distant, that it’s easy to forget they exist at all. One can go for days without human interaction, or one can hop in the car and drive down the dirt road to the Palms Restaurant for a beer. The point of the cabins isn’t to enact the now-clichéd off-the-grid adventure, but to exist just a few steps outside real life, in a stripped-down but completely functional environment — to re-examine, even relearn, everyday activities. A welcome disorientation, even an epiphany or two, might arise from doing without conventional touchstones like, say, a mirror, or a refrigerator. (Visitors are given a supply of bottled water, but bring in their own food and ice to stock the cooler.)And there is plenty of furniture in the literal sense, just not anything that reads easily as such. “I do believe in a certain amount of comfort,” Zittel says. “I believe in having a good spot to position your body so you can relax and do things. But I want people to find their own comfort without being catered to. It’s not just waiting there for you.”She is intimately familiar with the comfortable-uncomfortable sensation that the cabins can evoke; it characterized her early years in the desert. When Zittel left Brooklyn in 2000, many in the art world viewed it as a surprising retrenchment or even the end of her career. She had spent almost a decade represented by the acclaimed Andrea Rosen Gallery, showing such apparently urban-inflected works as the 1994 “A-Z Living Units,” a precursor to the “Planar Configurations” — portable pods that seemed inspired by cramped studios: Barbie’s-Dreamhouse-by-way-of-Bauhaus.Although she had grown up north of San Diego and spent time at her grandparents’ ranch in California’s Imperial Valley, she didn’t yearn for the wilderness in her 10 years in New York. There were no signs in her work of the organic monumentalism synonymous with the sculptors and conceptualists who first decamped for the desert, and she didn’t seem the type to erect a permanent museum of her art, as did the assemblage artist Noah Purifoy, a pioneer when he left L.A. for Joshua Tree in the 1980s. Nor did she give indications of wanting to create a conventional home and burrow into a solitary relationship with two-dimensional work, as had the female artists who famously forsook New York City for the Southwest, Georgia O’Keeffe and Agnes Martin. She was social, hosting weekly cocktail parties in her Williamsburg townhouse.But as others began discovering Brooklyn, she began feeling a pull toward the sun-blasted, desolate terrain of her childhood. Zittel sees herself as part of the 20th-century tradition of American artists leaving cities for the open spaces of the Southwest, but she is aware of her deviations. O’Keeffe and Martin chose the desert as a form of retreat, but Zittel saw it as liberation. As for the parallels often drawn between her and the largely male artists who came to make their massive, macho marks on the desert, she gently notes that she is not interested in “grand interventions,” only in finding meaning in intimate, everyday gestures. “The act of inhabiting and having an evolving relationship with a space or place is inherently different from the act of installing works like ‘Spiral Jetty’ or ‘Double Negative,’ ” she says.During my stay in the cabin, I established a routine determined by the movements of the sun: After daylight nudged me awake around five, I rose from the bed portion of the “Planar Configuration” and unlocked both doors to let in the early cross-breeze. Then I scooped ant corpses from the ice cooler and retrieved my sack of ground coffee. I checked my shoes for scorpions/tarantulas, and stepped outside to the composting toilet. I’d save the outdoor shower — a water tank modified with a hand pump — for later in the day, when the heat was unbearable. Then it was off to assess the dwindling freshwater reserve and to conduct frugal ablutions over a steel sink that drained through a black hose into a bucket below. I filled the kettle. Ignited the propane stove. Set out French press, bowl and spoon. (In keeping with Zittel’s catechism, there are only bowls, never glasses or plates, which she deems unnecessarily use-specific.) Carried two black wooden vintage stools out to the patio, one for sitting, the other for my breakfast and books. Every time a bead of perspiration rolled down my leg, I’d assume it was an ant and tried to flick it off, never learning.In the afternoon, the hot wind in my face like a blow dryer on high, I drove to the air-conditioned local library, with Zittel’s blessing; the cabin stay is meant to be challenging but not life-threatening. Back home around 6:00 p.m., I cooked a meal of spiced beans, avocado and tortillas and washed up in the final sliver of sun. After lighting the oil lanterns, I watched their flickering patterns, then sat outside to read. By 9:30 p.m. I was asleep, atop white sheets, enveloped in unbroken darkness.Before my trip, I’d been thinking about Zittel in relation to the social-utopia-makers of the 19th century, the “material feminists” who sought liberation by transforming the domestic sphere. In 1868, Melusina Fay Peirce, an organizer and author, spearheaded the “cooperative housekeeping movement,” proposing that wives charge their husbands for their domestic labor. The writer and reformer Charlotte Perkins Gilman argued for taking the kitchen out of the house, making it communal and hiring cooks to lessen the burden of “women’s work.” Could Zittel’s heady innovations be postmodern descendants of these ideas?But perched on a stool with the oil lamp and a book, the night astonishingly silent save for a lone coyote in the distance, I realized that Zittel isn’t interested in changing society or achieving political or social perfection, but is instead seeking liberation of a more private sort. Because here’s the strange thing: I never did get bored, or lonely, or restless during my stint in Zittel’s world. For all my physical discomfort throughout the week, I felt deeply, supremely calm. Existing alone in an unfamiliar space in which every detail has been considered and honed to its ultimate function was simultaneously soothing and stimulating. Engaged so closely with my immediate surroundings, I was able to drown out my ever-present anxieties. Bowls were no longer just bowls: They were the sole necessary vessel. Without a chair back, I sat up taller and lay down on the ground to watch the stars. I began to see the cabins as performance art, but with the artist herself absent — or, maybe, with the viewer taking the artist’s role. There was a kind of generosity, or trust, in that gesture.Among the materials Zittel had left me — an idiosyncratic mix that included Viktor E. Frankl’s “Man’s Search for Meaning,” back issues of “Lapham’s Quarterly” and local travel guides — was an ancient paperback, “Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions.” First published in 1884 by Edwin A. Abbott, an English theologian who wrote the novel under the pseudonym A. Square, it is an Euclidean sci-fi fantasy about a civilization of polygons who inhabit an alternate two-dimensional reality — not my usual genre, but during the long nights, I gave myself over to the barely sublimated satire of Victorian values.In the days and weeks following, long after I returned home, I saw rectangles everywhere — counter, bed, ceiling, blanket, book, cover, page. Even a line of text is a long, narrow rectangle. Viewed like this, through Zittel’s eyes, the material world seemed endlessly malleable, little more than a sequence of man-made conventions we’ve all agreed to preserve, whether or not they have outlived their usefulness, that were now merely burying — or distracting — us with infinite variety.I also came to see “Flatland” as more than a brainy curiosity or even a nod to Zittel’s obsession with geometry. Perhaps it was best read as a primer for the alternate reality she has single-handedly engineered, one that rejects society while remaining in rapt conversation with it. I didn’t get a chance to ask Zittel about the book before I returned to New York — the cacophonous, often disconnected city she abandoned long ago. I will never know why she left it out for me. What I did know, without her having to utter a word, was this: She is always thinking about everything, about every detail that adds up to a life, and that includes you.
