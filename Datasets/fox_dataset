All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  James Rosen has the latest for 'Special Report.'  A suspect accused of plowing a pickup truck onto a bike path and into a crowd in New York City on Tuesday, killing at least eight people and injuring 11 more, is not a U.S. citizen and is originally from Uzbekistan, federal law enforcement sources have confirmed to Fox News.  The attack occurred in Lower Manhattan, not far from the new World Trade Center building and the site of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.  Suspect Sayfullo Saipov, who was originally from Uzbekistan, was in the U.S. on a green card, sources confirmed to Fox News.

  The suspected driver, 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, had handwritten notes pledging his loyalty to the Islamic State terror network and shouted "Allahu Akbar" after the crash, law enforcement officials told Fox News. Saipov, who was shot by police, was taken into custody and remains hospitalized.  The suspect had a green card, a source told Fox News. Saipov came to the U.S. in 2010, and, according to the Associated Press, has a Florida license but may have been living in New Jersey.  Saipov was an Uber driver who had passed a background check, the company told Fox News. It added that Saipov has now been banned from the app, and Uber has offered assistance to the FBI.  Saipov's notes, written in Arabic and pledging loyalty to ISIS, turned up in and near the vehicle, Fox News is told. In addition, the New York Post reported that investigators found "an image of the ISIS flag inside his vehicle."  Four of the injured were teachers and students who were riding on a short yellow school bus near Stuyvesant High School when they were hit by the suspect's Home Depot rental truck. One student remained in critical condition.  The suspect in Tuesday's terror attack in New York City was driving a Home Depot rental truck when he plowed down a group of pedestrians near the World Trade Center.

  A victim killed in the attack was a Belgian citizen, Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Didier Reyners tweeted Tuesday. Three Belgians were also injured.  Others killed in the attack were Argentine citizens, according to Argentina's Foreign Ministry. Argentine newspaper La Nacion reported five of the eight people killed were Argentines traveling in the U.S. on a celebratory vacation.  This was a cowardly act of terror. It was intended to break our spirit. But New Yorkers are resilient. We will be undeterred.  Those killed, according to the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were Hernán Mendoza, Diego Angelini, Alejandro Pagnucco, Ariel Erlij and Hernán Ferruchi.  The attack was being treated as an act of terrorism. At a news conference Tuesday evening, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the attack "an act of terror and a particularly cowardly act of terror aimed at innocent civilians."  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo described it as a "lone wolf" attack, and added that there was no immediate evidence to suggest that there was a wider plot.  Around the globe, cities have been on high alert regarding vehicle attacks. ISIS has been encouraging its followers to mow down people, and Britain, France and Germany have all seen deadly vehicle attacks in recent months and years.  FBI officials confirmed to Fox News that they have agents responding to the situation with the New York Police Department. A bomb squad examined the truck, but found no explosives.  In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!  Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke said in a statement that DHS and its law enforcement partners "remain vigilant and committed to safeguarding the American people."  My thoughts, condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack. God and your country are with you!  Following the attack, President Donald Trump tweeted, "looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!"  Trump later tweeted his "thoughts, condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack. God and your country are with you!"  Police said the truck entered the bike path on West Street a few blocks from the new World Trade Center — the site of the deadliest terror attack in U.S. history — and plowed into several people. The driver jumped out of his rental truck — which police say Saipov rented from a Home Depot in New Jersey around 2 p.m. Tuesday — carrying what turned out to be a paintball gun and a pellet gun.  Video of the attack provided to Fox News by a witness shows the accused suspect running through traffic on the West Side Highway, surrounded by police in the nearby area.   Despite the attack, the city's Halloween Parade went on as planned, with police "dramatically increasing presence," including "personnel, blocker trucks, long guns etc.," according to de Blasio's press secretary. Cuomo and de Blasio both attended the annual event.  Fox News' Jake Gibson, Catherine Herridge, Rick Leventhal and the Associated Press contributed to this report.

                                  The head of National Public Radio’s news department was placed on leave Tuesday after he was accused of sexual harassment by two women who claimed he made unwanted advances toward them while he worked at the New York Times nearly 20 years ago.  Both women claimed Michael Oreskes kissed them and stuck his tongue in their mouths after they had approached him about working at the Times in the late 1990s, when Oreskes was the paper’s Washington bureau chief.  The allegations against Oreskes were first reported by The Washington Post.  NPR reported Tuesday that Oreskes was formally rebuked following a separate incident two years ago where a female producer complained she was made to feel uncomfortable after a dinner in which Oreskes talked about sex and inquired about her personal life. The woman, Rebecca Hersher, said on the NPR report that "it undercut my confidence."  NPR said in a statement on Tuesday: "We take these kinds of allegations very seriously. If a concern is raised, we review the matter promptly and take appropriate steps as warranted to assure a safe, comfortable and productive work environment. As a matter of policy, we do not comment about personnel matters."  Attempts to reach Oreskes were unsuccessful.  Jill Abramson, the Times’ former executive editor who was Oreskes’ deputy in the Washington bureau at the time of the alleged encounters, recalled that he also showed special interest in a woman who worked as a news aide.  "If I had to do it again, I would have told him to knock it off," she told the Post. "Maybe confronting him would have somehow stopped him from doing it to another woman."  When asked if Oreskes' conduct had drawn complaints at the Times, a spokesperson said the paper "takes all allegations of sexual harassment seriously and we are looking into it." Oreskes was also at different times a political correspondent, metro editor and deputy managing editor at The Times, as well as executive editor of the Times-owned International Herald Tribune in Paris.  Oreskes was a vice president and senior managing editor at The Associated Press from 2008 until he joined NPR in 2015. When asked for comment, AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said the AP does not provide information on personnel matters.  "The Associated Press takes any kind of harassment allegation very seriously," Easton said. "If a report is made, it is promptly investigated and appropriate action is taken. The AP is committed to maintaining a safe working environment and does not tolerate harassment of any kind."  Both women who accused Oreskes told the Post that they were motivated to come forward by NPR’s coverage of sexual misconduct allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein, political journalist Mark Halperin and other men prominent in their industries.  "The idea that he’s in charge of that coverage is just so hypocritical to me," one of the women said. "It’s sickening. I want to say: ‘You owe me ... a public apology.'"

Democratic group pulls ad targeting Virginia governor hopeful Ed Gillespie's supporters  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  On 'Fox & Friends,' the Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate reacts to a Democratic ad implying his supporters are Confederates who attack minority kids.  A television ad depicting supporters of Virginia gubernatorial hopeful Ed Gillespie as Confederates who attack children of color has been pulled in the wake of the terror attack in New York City.  The Democratic group Latino Victory Fund removed the controversial ad, which showed a pickup truck driver chasing down children of color on Tuesday, Oct. 31.  “We knew our ad would ruffle feathers. We held a mirror up to the Republican Party, and they don’t like what they see. We have decided to pull our ad at this time,” said Cristobal J. Alex, president of the LVF, in a statement on Twitter Tuesday evening.  “Given recent events, we will be placing other powerful ads into rotation that highlight the reasons we need to elect progressive leaders in Virginia.”  The statement was released just hours after investigators said the suspected driver, identified as 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, plowed a rented pickup truck into a crowd in Lower Manhattan. The incident, being treated as a terror attack, left at least eight dead and at least 11 others injured.  The ad was released on Monday and was expected to run through Election Day.  Gillespie denounced the ad Tuesday morning in an interview with “Fox & Friends.”  “This attack is not just an attack on my supporters, it’s an attack on all Virginians. The fact is, whether you disagree with people or not, in Virginia, we respect civil discourse and this is a new low in politics here. It’s a sad day,” Gillespie said.  In a statement to Fox News, Gillespie’s campaign manager called the ad a “desperate smear campaign.”     This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC.

                                  Halloween has lived up to its reputation in New York.  Now, there may be a legitimate debate about whether President Trump is unfairly singling out Muslims in his efforts to make America safe. But when a terrorist kills Americans – this time, with a rental truck – and then shouts “God is great” in Arabic, the president’s zeal is understandable.  There is no way to protect every block in our cities, every field on our farms, every school in our suburbs. We have become accustomed to our freedom to move around as we wish, and to gather with whom we choose.  No one could have foreseen Tuesday’s sinister mission to turn a vehicle into a deadly weapon. We stroll our streets without paying attention to what’s around us, intent on reading or sending text messages, or watching videos on our phones. If we’re on a bike lane, we assume no four-wheel vehicles will intrude.  The problem is that terrorists – those whose perverted view equates God’s greatness with acts of bloodshed – know how clueless we are, and exploit our assumption that nothing bad can happen to us. And it is that careless confidence that makes us easy prey, soft victims for determined evildoers.  The problem is that terrorists – those whose perverted view equates God’s greatness with acts of bloodshed – know how clueless we are, and exploit our assumption that nothing bad can happen to us. And it is that careless confidence that makes us easy prey, soft victims for determined evildoers.  Even before the names of the perpetrator and the dead and injured are known, there will be warnings not to stereotype, not to sully the reputation of any faith or ideology. Don’t link radical Islam with terror.  Yet, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio came right out and said it: “This was an act of terror.” That was already apparent to the New York City police, whom de Blasio has repeatedly insulted as racists, and demeaned for quickly confronting the dangers of criminal behavior.   That’s the same de Blasio who pompously defied Trump’s call to dismantle so-called sanctuary cities, making it tougher for authorities to find and corral criminals.  “Don’t let the terrorists change our life in any shape, manner or form,” said Gov. Andrew Cuomo, just two hours after the attack took place.  That’s right, New Yorkers. Listen to your governor. Don’t take any extra precautions in how you live your lives. Don’t admit that there are evil people in the world who want to kill you, then exhort God’s greatness. Don’t use that ugly word -- war – to describe our conflict with radical Islam. Don’t offend. And don’t defend. It might upset someone.  Trick or treat.  John Moody is Executive Vice President, Executive Editor for Fox News.

NYC terror attack: Halloween horror would have been much worse without top notch NYPD  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  NY Post: Sayfullo Saipov left behind handwritten notes pledging loyalty to ISIS along with an image of an ISIS flag inside his vehicle. #Tucker  Editor's note: The following column first appeared in City Journal, a publication of the Manhattan Institute.  The Halloween assault in Lower Manhattan was straight out of the ISIS playbook. Ever since October 2010, when Al Qaeda published the second issue of its online magazine Inspire, jihadi leaders have been urging the faithful to turn ordinary cars and trucks into killing machines to “mow down the enemies of Allah.”  On Tuesday in New York, Sayfullo Saipov, 29, a green-card holder from Uzbekistan in Central Asia and resident of Florida, responded to the call.  He drove his rented Home Depot truck from West Houston Street onto a Hudson River Park bike path, one of New York’s most beloved amenities. Within ten minutes, eight people were killed and 15 were injured. A note found in the truck, law enforcement officials said, indicated that Saipov committed the attack out of devotion to ISIS.  Saipov might have killed even more people had the NYPD not been the nation’s premier counterterrorism force. NYPD officers showed up in force minutes after the attack began, shooting Saipov before he could kill even more New Yorkers.  At a news conference at 1 Police Plaza less than two hours after the deadly attack, John Miller, the New York Police Department’s chief of counterterrorism, cited the Islamic State’s updated guidance to jihadi aspirants contained in the third November 2016 issue of its own online journal, Rumiya (Rome), as the attacker’s probable inspiration. The article encouraged followers to attack “large outdoor conventions and celebrations, pedestrian-congested streets, outdoor markets, festivals, festivals, parades, [and] political rallies.” It even specified the ideal type, weight, and speed of a car needed for terror purposes, according to a translation provided by the Counter-Extremism Project.  It seems likely that the killer’s original target may have been the famous Greenwich Village Halloween parade, another beloved New York tradition that close to 1 million people typically attend. But the NYPD’s overwhelming security presence, and the numerous street closures adjacent to the parade, may have dashed his dreams of an even more memorable massacre.  While the attack investigation is ongoing and details of Saipov’s motives and plans are still being gathered, the vehicle assault bore the hallmarks of the attacks that ISIS and other militant jihadi groups have long been promoting. NYPD commissioner James O’Neill said that the terrorist emerged from his rental vehicle after crashing into a school bus screaming a statement that indicated terrorist intent. While the politically attuned O’Neill declined to identify what the attacker shouted, the language in which he was shouting, or his suspected nationality, numerous eye witnesses said that the man, dressed in dark clothing and carrying a pellet gun and a paint-ball gun, was screaming “Allahu Akhbar”—“God is Great” in Arabic.  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo pointed out another hallmark of a vehicle assault. The perp, he said, was one of those “lone wolves” who “meant to cause pain and harm and probably death and the resulting terror.”  But it takes a pack to raise a lone wolf. Even if Saipov acted alone, he was part of a growing ideological fraternity numbering in the tens of thousands who now inhabit every region of the globe.  Those seeking eternal glory have staged similar attacks in at least a dozen other cities—from Nice to Paris to Barcelona to London to Jerusalem.  Like the attacks in these cities, the Halloween attack in Lower Manhattan was aimed at inflicting maximum carnage. Schools in the area were letting out students shortly after three o’clock when Saipov drove his rented truck off West Houston Street onto the bike path.  There was no shortage of targets. The streets between West Houston and Chambers were crowded with parents picking up their costumed children prepared for an evening of trick-or-treating. Pedestrians and bikers on the Hudson River bike path were stunned and helpless as Saipov careened his weapon through the crowd.  With the collapse of its self-declared “caliphate” in Syria and Iraq, ISIS is on the run. So are its adherents. But as the extremists disperse, the terrorist threat, paradoxically, increases. American and other intelligence agencies have long warned of a likely rise in vehicle and other attacks as the frustrated, furious faithful are forced to reorient their campaign. In May 2017, the U.S. Transportation and Security Agency (TSA) warned truck and bus companies to be on guard for suspicious individuals seeking to rent vehicles.  According to TSA data, Islamist terrorists have carried out more than a dozen vehicular assaults since 2014 that have killed more than 170 people. Such attacks are ever more likely, the TSA memo warned, since “unsophisticated tactics such as vehicle-ramming” are hard to prevent and capable of inflicting “mass casualties if successful.”  Saipov might have killed even more people had the NYPD not been the nation’s premier counterterrorism force. NYPD officers showed up in force minutes after the attack began, shooting Saipov before he could kill even more New Yorkers.  The NYPD, in fact, was already responding to the vehicular threat long before this type of terror became the focus of federal concern.  At Tuesday’s press conference, Miller discussed the department’s SHIELD program, which has sent officers to brief some 20,000 businesses in the private sector about the growing terrorist threat post–9/11.  Miller noted that after Rumiya reissued its call for vehicular attacks and suggested an assault on the Thanksgiving Day parade, the NYPD visited over 148 truck rental offices in the metropolitan area asking employees to watch for “suspicious indicators.” The police department conducted repeated visits in person and by phone, he said.  Even more essential has been the NYPD’s intelligence division, which has long collected information about suspicious individuals. After being heavily, and in many instances unfairly, criticized for allegedly violating civil liberties, Miller’s former boss, William Bratton, shut down a particularly controversial program that the intelligence unit had run early in its existence—a so-called “demographic unit” that collected information on the location and activities of Muslims suspected of terrorist intentions.  Another critic was New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who lambasted the NYPD for surveilling New Jersey-based Muslims and asked whether the spying was “borne out of arrogance, or out of paranoia, or out of both.” Unconfirmed news reports Tuesday night indicated that Saipov had lived for some time in Paterson, New Jersey.  But the NYPD has not scaled back most of its vital surveillance activities. In fact, New York’s Finest, working in tandem with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies that comprise the Joint Terrorism Task Force, have continued collecting information on suspected terrorists living in and visiting the city.  They were unable to prevent the Halloween attack. The so-called “flash-to-bang” trajectory of lone-wolf radicalization is accelerating. An individual intent on mayhem against “soft” targets is the toughest law enforcement terrorist challenge.  Eight people were killed Tuesday. But the toll could have been much higher had the police not responded so quickly and New Yorkers not been so stubbornly resilient.  Concluding his remarks Tuesday, Governor Cuomo issued his own call to arms. “We’re not going to let them win,” he said. “And if we change our lives, we contort ourselves to them, then they win and we lose.”  Three and a half hours after Saipov’s wicked rampage, hundreds of thousands of costumed New Yorkers poured into the streets to celebrate Halloween, as planned. Paradoxically, Saipov’s perverse mission failed: New Yorkers were not cowed, and he was denied the martyrdom that he was clearly seeking.  Shot in the stomach, Saipov will probably live to be brought to justice, not far from the scene of his heinous crime.   Seth Barron is associate editor of City Journal and project director of the NYC Initiative at the Manhattan Institute.

  Saipov had worked as an Uber driver in New Jersey, where he was living as recently as this summer. Uber confirmed to Fox News that Saipov passed the company's background check for drivers, and is now banned from the app. Uber added it has not found any safety reports concerning the terror suspect.  Saipov drove a rented pickup truck through a crowded bike path for several blocks before finally crashing into a yellow school bus near Chambers and West Street, police said.  After exiting the vehicle, Saipov yelled “Allahu Akbar” and waived around weapons believed to be a paintball gun and a BB gun. The suspect was shot twice by police and taken into custody. He remains in the hospital and is expected to survive his wounds.  NYC ‘TERROR’ ATTACK LEAVES 8 DEAD, SEVERAL INJURED  Law enforcement officials discovered two handwritten notes written in Arabic pledging loyalty to ISIS in and near the truck, Fox News has confirmed.  The New York Post reported that some type of symbol or picture of the terrorist organization's flag was discovered.  It's been reported Saipov rented the truck from a Home Depot in Passaic, New Jersey, around 2 p.m. on Tuesday -- an hour or so before the attack occurred.  Authorities discovered that Saipov had a Florida license and he’s been connected to an address in the Tampa area.   POLITICIANS REACT TO FATAL NYC TRUCK ATTACK IN LOWER MANHATTAN  The friend, Kobiljon Matkarov, said he met Saipov while the two were living in Florida and described him as “very friendly” and “very nice.”  Matkarov said he last saw the suspect a few months ago when Saipov picked him up from John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. Saipov had moved to the area in order to find better work opportunities.  Matkarov told Fox News that he never noticed any unusual behavior from the suspect, let alone the fact that he’d been radicalized and that he was generally a happy-go-lucky person who loved America.  “I know his good side. I know nothing of his bad side,” Matkarov said. “He was always happy. He liked the U.S. He loved this country. That’s why this is all very confusing.”  In a statement to Fox News, Uber said the company has been in contact with the FBI and has offered its assistance investigating Saipov. It added Uber is reviewing Saipov's history with the transportation company.   Fox News’ Perry Chiaramonte and Nicole Darrah and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Trump initially reacted to the terror attack in Lower Manhattan by saying it was done by a “sick and deranged person.”  “In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person,” the president tweeted. “Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!”  In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!  Authorities said at least eight people died and 11 were injured after a driver plowed into a bike path in New York on Tuesday afternoon. Sayfullo Saipov, 29, was shot by police and taken into custody following the attack.  "My thoughts, condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack," Trump later tweeted. "God and your country are with you!"  My thoughts, condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack. God and your country are with you!  Meanwhile, the president vowed to stop the Islamic State from executing terror attacks in the United States.  "We must not allow ISIS to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere," Trump said. "Enough!"  Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the president has been briefed on the attack by chief of staff John Kelly and will be updated as “more details are known.”    “Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected,” Sanders said.  First lady Melania Trump also tweeted that her “heart breaks” for her hometown.  My heart breaks for #NYC today. Thoughts & prayers as we monitor the situation.  “My heart breaks for #NYC today,” she tweeted. “Thoughts & prayers as we monitor the situation.”  The FBI is investigating the incident as terrorism, Fox News has learned. It is being jointly investigated by both the New York Police Department and the FBI.  The Department of Homeland Security said its acting secretary, Elaine Duke, has also been briefed on “the apparent act of terrorism” and is “closely monitoring the situation and working with our federal, state and local partners in responding to and investigating this tragedy.”  “We have recently seen attacks like this one throughout the world,” the department said in a news release. “DHS and its law enforcement partners remain vigilant and committed to safeguarding the American people.”   Fox News’ Jake Gibson contributed to this report.

Hours after a suspected terrorist killed at least eight people after plowing a truck down a pedestrian lane on a New York City highway Tuesday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced stronger security measures “out of an abundance of caution.”  The governor ordered state agencies, including New York Police, the National Guard and Homeland Security, “to increase security at high-profile locations around the state, including airports, bridges, tunnels, and mass transit systems.”  CELEBRITIES REACT TO NYC TRUCK ATTACK  The heightened security measures are a result of a terror attack that occurred in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday afternoon.

  The suspected attacker, 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, drove a truck — reportedly rented from a Home Depot in New Jersey — down a pedestrian bike lane on the West Side Highway, just blocks from the World Trade Center.  Around the globe, cities have been on high alert regarding vehicle attacks. The Islamic State has been encouraging its followers to mow down people, and England, France and Germany all have seen deadly vehicle attacks in recent months and years.  Cuomo, who requested that the World Trade Center “be lit in red, white and blue in honor of freedom and democracy,” said in a statement that he was “deeply saddened by the attack,” and wanted to reassure citizens that the attack was not part of a larger terror plot.  Tuesday's terror attack in Lower Manhattan was just blocks away from the new World Trade Center, where the largest terror attack in U.S. history took place just over 16 years ago.

NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill commended Nash in a news conference Tuesday evening, saying the young officer “stopped the carnage moments after it began.”  A source told Fox News that 29-year-old Saipov was from Uzbekistan and had a green card. He remains hospitalized following the attack.     This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.

I hope everyone’s ok. Was half a block from me, didn’t see it but heard 8-10 quick rounds fired off. Be safe with your kids out there.  “Oh my god I just heard gun shots and ran with my dog. Downtown. F---,” he said. “I hope everyone’s ok. Was half a block from me, didn’t see it but heard 8-10 quick rounds fired off.

Virginia gov race ad sparks outrage, portrays Gillespie supporter trying to mow down kids  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  On 'Fox & Friends,' the Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate reacts to a Democratic ad implying his supporters are Confederates who attack minority kids.  Democratic candidate for Virginia governor Ralph Northam is not distancing himself from the controversial ad suggesting supporters of Republican candidate Ed Gillespie are seen as Confederates who attack minority children.  The new opposition ad titled “American Nightmare” was released Monday by Democratic group Latino Victory Fund (LVF) and is scheduled to run through Election Day. The opposition ad shows minority children seemingly being chased by a driver in a pickup truck, decked out with a Confederate flag, a “Gillespie for governor” bumper sticker and a “Don’t tread on me” license plate.  The driver makes his way toward the scared children who shout, “Run! Run! Run!” when they see the truck. The ad concludes with a scene of a Charlottesville-like rally, with a  narrator asking: “Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by the ‘American Dream?’”  Ed Gillespie and Donald Trump promise the American dream, but can only deliver an American nightmare. No more. Vote @RalphNortham. #GameOnVA pic.twitter.com/mwpWXM47HZ  Northam’s campaign told Fox News Tuesday that the ad was “not shocking” based on Gillespie’s campaign.  “Independent groups are denouncing Ed Gillespie because he has run the most divisive, fear-mongering campaign in modern history,” Northam campaign spokeswoman Ofirah Yheskel said in a statement to Fox News. “It is not shocking that communities of color are scared of what his Trump-like policy positions mean for them.”  But Gillespie said the ad was “an attack on” his “supporters,” whom   he calls “good decent hardworking Virginians who love their neighbors.”  VIRGINIA GOVERNOR RACE: WHO ARE ED GILLESPIE AND RALPH NORTHAM?  “The fact is, whether you disagree with people or not, in Virginia, we respect civil discourse and this is a new low in politics here. It’s a sad day,” Gillespie said on “Fox & Friends” Tuesday. “I was glad when a couple of the Democratic members of our House Delegates yesterday condemned the ad, but outrageously my opponent has embraced it, and it reveals a disdain not just for more supporters but for all Virginians, frankly, who want to have a discussion about issues and policies in this election that I’ve been focused on.”  Gillespie added: “They [Northam campaign] don’t want to debate the issues, and instead of debating the issues, they just demonize, they vilify, they marginalize anyone who disagrees with them.”  Ed Gillespie, right, said that Ralph Northam, left, is embracing the controversial ad released by LVF. 
								
									 (AP)
  In a statement to Fox News, Gillespie’s campaign manager Chris Leavitt called the latest ad part of “a desperate smear campaign” against Gillespie.  “This is no an attack on Ed Gillespie anymore. This is an all-out attack on the people of Virginia,” Leavitt told Fox News. “This latest ad gives us a clear indication of just what Ralph Northam and his national Democratic allies think of all of us, and it’s sickening.”  The LVF ad is not the only one drawing significant criticism in this gubernatorial race.  Northam’s campaign came under fire after a Democratic mailer showing Gillespie and Trump, along with a photo of white nationalists carrying torches in another Charlottesville-like scene. The mailer encourages voters to “stand up to hate.”  Northam has stood by the mailer and slammed Gillespie for not denouncing the president “for not calling these white supremacists out for who they are.”  “Because the message is that we live in a very diverse society. That means that we need to be inclusive,” Northam said, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.  “The Lieutenant Governor [Northam] was roundly rebuked for exploiting imagery from the tragedy of Charlottesville for political points,” Leavitt said. “Now his allies have reached a new low with a disgusting, vile television ad seeking to instill fear in our children with that same imagery.”  Gillespie has also been criticized for ads that attempt to tie Northam to the MS-13 gang. One ad accuses Northam of being “weak” on combating the gang.  Northam, who is currently the lieutenant governor of Virginia, has had a star-studded roster of Democratic guests on the campaign trail, including former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, and a fundraiser in New York earlier this month headlined by Hillary Clinton.  Gillespie, on the other hand, has had Vice President Pence with him on the campaign trail, and a fundraiser hosted by President George W. Bush. Gillespie has been endorsed by President Trump, who repeatedly expresses his support for the Republican candidate on Twitter.

NBC terminates Mark Halperin's contract following sexual assault allegations  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  'Game Change' author and NBC News, MSNBC political analyst Mark Halperin is out at the network following sexual harassment allegations against him from five women.  NBC announced on Monday that the network has terminated the contract of on-air contributor Mark Halperin, according to multiple media reports. Last week, Halperin was accused of sexual assault by several women.   MSNBC previously suspended Halperin on Thursday. The network stated it found Halperin's conduct as described in a CNN story "very troubling." The alleged misconduct took place while Halperin was an exec at ABC News.   Halperin has apologized for what he termed inappropriate behavior, and ABC said Thursday that no complaints were filed against him during his tenure, which ended more than a decade ago.  ALL THE SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST MARK HALPERIN  The women, who asked to remain anonymous, said they didn't report Halperin's conduct because they feared retribution or were embarrassed.  But Emily Miller, a former ABC employee who is now a reporter at One America News Network, retweeted the Halperin story on Thursday with the hashtag "#MeToo."  She gave no details of her alleged incident, but tweeted that she did not report Halperin to ABC "because I thought I was the only one, and I blamed myself, and I was embarrassed and I was scared of him."  CNN international correspondent Clarissa Ward, who also used to work at ABC, tweeted that Halperin's behavior was "an open secret" at the network. She saluted the women who came forward in the CNN story.  "Let's be very clear — the one responsible for any sexual misconduct that may have taken place is the man who instigated it," Ward tweeted, "NOT the women who were victims of it, nor their friends and colleagues who tried to support them through it."  Halperin told CNN Wednesday night that he's "deeply sorry" and is taking a "step back" from day-to-day work to deal with the situation.  His statement came after CNN reported allegations that Halperin propositioned, fondled and pushed himself against five women in the early 2000s while he was ABC News' political director.  Please read my statement below. pic.twitter.com/8ld8k8DC6O  Halperin says he pursued relationships, sometimes with junior co-workers, but CNN says he denies the groping allegations.  Later Thursday, Penguin Press canceled a planned book by Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2016 election and HBO called off a miniseries that would have been based on the book. Halperin and Heilemann had collaborated on two previous books, including "Game Change," a best-seller about the 2008 race that almost single-handedly revived the campaign book genre and was the basis for an award-winning HBO adaptation.  "HBO has no tolerance for sexual harassment within the company or its productions," the company said in an emailed statement.  On MSNBC's "Morning Joe" Thursday, co-host Mika Brzezinski informed viewers about Halperin. He has been a frequent panelist on the show.  "We're going to be following this story as it develops," she said. "I'm sure we'll be talking about it again when we know more about it."  The Associated Press contributed to this report.

                                  The New Hampshire state attorney general said Tuesday he is probing allegations of sexual misconduct against three Dartmouth professors.  The announcement came a week after Dartmouth said it was investigating potential “serious misconduct” against the three educators without clarification.  Attorney General Gordon MacDonald said his investigation is based on information provided by the Ivy League school.  “This office has engaged in a dialogue with Dartmouth College and we have learned from the College that it has received allegations of sexual misconduct,” MacDonald said.  The three professors are Todd Heatherton, Bill Kelley and Paul Whalen according to officials. They are members of the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the Hanover school.  They've been placed on paid leave and had their access to the campus restricted.   “It is important to remember that investigations are ongoing, with no official findings yet produced,” Dartmouth president Phil Hanlon said in an email Tuesday to the campus community. “However, we take these allegations very seriously and are pursuing our own independent investigations in coordination with law enforcement officials.”  Heatherton and his colleagues did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News.  Last week, a local attorney told the Valley News in West Lebanon that Heatherton was cooperating with Dartmouth’s investigation.

                                  A Las Vegas police officer accidentally fired his gun in Stephen Paddock’s suite the night of the mass shooting, the department’s sheriff said Monday, breaking more than two weeks of silence and confirming for the first time that an officer fired his weapon during the Oct. 1 incident.  Sheriff Joe Lombardo said the gun went off after the officers made entry to the room, but the rounds were not fired in the room where Paddock was found dead.  “It happened and we’re investigating it, just like we do with any officer-involved use of force,” Lombardo told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “Nobody was struck.”  It was not immediately clear what caused the officer to discharge his weapon or why Paddock stopped firing on a crowd from his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.  Lombardo also confirmed to the newspaper the only cameras on Paddock’s floor were facing the elevators, and there were no cameras pointed at Paddock's corner suite or towards the stairwell door next to Paddock's room. Security guard Jesus Campos, who was shot by Paddock before the mass shooting began, has said Paddock barricaded the stairwell door.  Paddock was found dead with what police have described as a self-inflicted gunshot wound after killing 58 people.

'Monster' planet discovery stuns scientists  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  Astronomers have discovered a planet the size of Jupiter orbiting a star that's only half the size of the sun, contradicting theories that a star so small could form a planet so large.  Astronomers have discovered a planet the size of Jupiter orbiting a star that’s only half the size of the sun — a celestial phenomenon that contradicts theories of planet formation.  NGTS-1b, a massive, 986-degrees-hot ball of gas revolving around a red M-dwarf star 600 light years from Earth, is the largest planet compared to the size of its star ever found.  The discovery contradicts theories that a star so small could form a planet so large. Scientists previously theorized that small stars could form rocky planets, but they did not gather enough material to form planets the size of Jupiter.  STARGZERS FIND TWENTY NEW EARTH-LIKE PLANETS THAT COULD HOST LIFE  As red M-dwarf stars are the most common type in the universe, scientists now believe there may be many more planets like this.  Artist's impression of planet NGTS-1b with its neighbouring sun (credit University of Warwick/Mark Garlick)
								
					          NGTS-1b was spotted by an international collaboration of researchers using the Next-Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) facility in Chile, according to a report from the University of Warwick.  It is about 2.8 million miles away from its star — only 3 percent of the 93-million-mile distance between Earth and the sun. A year on NGTS-1b — the time it takes to revolve around its star — occurs every 2.6 Earth days.  NASA RELEASES EERIE PLAYLIST OF SPELLBINDING SPACE SOUNDS  "The discovery of NGTS-1b was a complete surprise to us. Such massive planets were not thought to exist around such small stars,” said the lead author of the research, Dr. Daniel Bayliss of the University of Warwick’s Astronomy and Astrophysics Group. “This is the first exoplanet we have found with our new NGTS facility, and we are already challenging the received wisdom of how planets form.”  “NGTS-1b was difficult to find, despite being a monster of a planet, because its parent star is small and faint,” said Warwick Professor Peter Wheatley. “Small stars are actually the most common in the universe, so it is possible that there are many of these giant planets waiting to found.  “Having worked for almost a decade to develop the NGTS telescope array, it is thrilling to see it picking out new and unexpected types of planets. I'm looking forward to seeing what other kinds of exciting new planets we can turn up.”  SUNSCREEN 'SNOW' FALLS ON SCORCHING-HOT ALIEN PLANET  The astronomers’ report, ‘NGTS-1b: a hot Jupiter transiting an M-dwarf’, will be published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

Podesta brothers fight back against Trump, Mueller and Fox News  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  Tony Podesta reportedly tells his staff he will fight the allegations; reaction from Rep. Doug Collins, vice chair of the House Republican Conference and a member of the Judiciary Committee.  One of the most powerful Democrat-linked families on K Street fought back Tuesday against the White House, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russian investigation and even Fox News for reporting on the spiraling probe.  The powerful Podesta family's troubles came into view Monday with lobbyist Tony Podesta’s mysterious resignation from his firm. That raised concerns that the brother of Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager, John Podesta, might know more than he’s letting on about Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.  On Tuesday, Trump tweeted, “The biggest story yesterday, the one that has the Dems in a dither, is Podesta running from his firm. What he know(s) about Crooked Dems is earth shattering. He and his brother could Drain The Swamp, which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled. Fake News weak!”  The biggest story yesterday, the one that has the Dems in a dither, is Podesta running from his firm. What he know about Crooked Dems is....  Trump did not say what specifically he thinks Podesta knows or how it affects the special prosecutor’s case.  John Podesta fired back at Trump’s accusations, tweeting “Not bad enough that I was the victim of a massive cyber crime directed by the Russian President. Now I’m the victim of a big lie campaign by the American President.”  Not bad enough that I was the victim of a massive cyber crime directed by the Russian President (1/3)  He added, “@realDonaldTrump seems a lot more worried now than July 2016 when he asked the Russians to hack our campaign.”  Big brother Tony Podesta has been a pivotal figure in DC, where he has made a fortune off lobbying efforts. He and his former wife, Heather Podesta, were well known around town for hosting fancy fundraisers for high-rolling Democratic clients in their home.  On Monday, Tony Podesta stepped down from the firm he built as federal prosecutors probing claims of Russian interference charged former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and his aide Rick Gates with money laundering.  Manafort and Gates pleaded not guilty to a 12-count indictment. Charges ranged from conspiracy against the United States to failure to file reports of foreign banks and financial accounts.  The indictment described Manafort’s efforts to hide his lobbying tactics and money be made on behalf of the Party of the Regions.  The Party of the Regions is a pro-Kremlin political base for Ukraine’s former President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia three years ago.  Manafort allegedly enlisted the help of The Podesta Group, which did work for a group known as the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine.  The special counsel probe and Russia “hoax,” as the president has described it, has cast a cloud over the Trump administration. But last week, the White House enjoyed a shift in focus, amid new revelations in the controversial Obama-era Uranium One deal and the payments behind the salacious anti-Trump dossier.  In a Monday email to his staff, Podesta said he was stepping down because he "needs to fight this as an individual, but doesn't want the firm to fight it," a person familiar with the farewell speech said.  Dubbed one of DC’s “50 heavy lifters” by the Financial Times and one of “Washington’s biggest players” by The New York Times, Podesta turned his once-modest lobbying firm into a DC heavy hitter.   But in the wake of the Mueller investigation the Podesta Group has struggled.  About a half dozen of its clients have cut ties with the firm this year. The firm brought in an estimated $4.8 million in the third quarter of 2017, down from $6.1 million in the third quarter of 2016.  On Monday, Fox News host Tucker Carlson said Tony Podesta’s lawyer Geoff Garinther with Venable LLP, demanded the show “immediately cease and desist disseminating false and misleading reports about Mr. Podesta and the Podesta Group.”  “Tony Podesta resigned as head of his company,” Carlson said on his tv show. “His excuse? Us. That’s right. He blamed us.”  Last week, Carlson said the Podesta brothers were “central figures” in the federal investigation. Carlson also reported that Manafort’s company, the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, was a major client of the Podesta group.

Breeding dogs to have muscular dystrophy for medical research sparks outcry  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  Raw video: Texas A&M is under fire over its research on dogs with muscular dystrophy. This video was sent to PETA by an anonymous worker at the university lab.  An online petition signed by more than 200,000 people is demanding a halt to a taxpayer-funded research project at Texas A&M University that studies muscular dystrophy’s debilitating effects in golden retrievers, arguing that it is cruel and scientifically useless.  Two Texas A&M students are behind the Change.org petition, which seeks an end to the experimentation led by Dr. Joseph Kornegay, in which the dogs are bred to develop different types of muscular dystrophy, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy -- a particularly severe form of the disease that causes progressive muscle wasting and weakness.  "Studies with these dogs haven't led to a cure or even a treatment to reverse disease symptoms, even after experimenting for 30 years," states the petition, which as of Tuesday morning had 217,645 signatures.  The petition follows a year-long protest by animal rights activists that began after an anonymous worker at the Texas A&M laboratory sent photos and videos of disabled dogs to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).  The images, obtained by PETA in 2013, showed golden retrievers struggling to walk and eat. Drool dripped from the mouths of dogs whose jaw muscles had weakened as a result of disease. PETA promptly filed an open records request for information about the research, which the group contends Kornegay has been conducting for more than 30 years at various institutions.  By late last year, PETA compiled corroborating evidence from the university on the research as well as testimony from scientists who claim the experiments are of no value to human patients.    "We had no idea that these sorts of experiments were going on," Dr. Alka Chandna, PETA's senior laboratory oversight specialist, told Fox News.  "It’s sad that in nature we see disease and disability but to deliberately breed animals to have muscular dystrophy is criminal," Chandna said. "They are using public money to conduct research that is painful and involves a lot of suffering."  "At the end of the day, dogs and humans are not being helped," she said.  In its effort to end the program, PETA cites Kornegay's own writings detailing how researchers stretch muscles of the dogs with levers to induce mechanical damage and how some dogs experience a shift in their hind limbs and an inability to open their mouths.  But the university stands firm in its belief that the research is valuable in developing new treatments for the disease in humans -- in particular, Duchenne muscular dystrophy. DMD is a genetic disease that affects boys, all of whom die early in life.  "While DMD occurs in nature in both children and dogs, the disease is not as severe in dogs, which means dogs offer a unique opportunity to learn as much as possible, thereby helping all affected by DMD," university spokeswoman Amy Smith said, speaking on behalf of Kornegay and the research project.  "After years of study, we are close to a promising novel treatment involving gene therapy," she said.   Smith also noted that the Federal Drug Administration requires medications to be studied in at least two animal species before being tried with people.  "Without animal studies, there will be no new medications for people," she said.  Texas A&M also defends its handling of the dogs, saying they are treated with "great care and tenderness for the heroes that they are."  Similar studies on dogs with muscular dystrophy are being conducted in one other U.S. university and possibly a third.  Kornegay, who works at Texas A&M's Department of Veterinary Integrative Biosciences, has written for more than 30 publications about his research on muscular dystrophy in dogs, including a 2013 article titled "Comparative Genomics of X-linked Muscular Dystrophies: The Golden Retriever Model."  "There’s not another way," Kornegay told Fox News in a December 2016 interview.    "I’m a dog lover. I’m a veterinarian. I’ve had dogs all my life," he said. "So every time we have a research project we want to be as sure as we can that the research will be valuable because the dogs are valuable. Not financially valuable, but valuable as individuals."  Animals rights groups, however, say the photos and video "say it all" about the treatment of the dogs at Texas A&M.  "I think it's clear there's no love there. There's no care there. This is not what anybody would consider humane," said Chandna.   "The university's claims ring hallow," she said. "Decades of tormenting and killing dogs have yielded nothing."     Cristina Corbin is a Fox News reporter based in New York. Follow her on Twitter @CristinaCorbin.

200 feared dead after tunnel collapses at North Korean nuclear test site, Japanese TV claims  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  Greg Palkot reports on the alleged evacuation drills in the region.  About 200 people are feared dead in North Korea after underground tunnels at a nuclear test site that was feared to be unstable reportedly collapsed, crushing 100 people in the initial cave-in and 100 others when the tunnels again gave way on top of rescuers.  The collapse at the Punggye-ri test site on Oct. 10 occurred while people were doing construction on the underground tunnel, Japan’s Asahi TV reported, citing a source in North Korea. The television station also said North Korea’s sixth nuclear test on Sept. 3 most likely caused the tunnel to crumble and created serious damage in the region.  No officials have confirmed the Japanese TV station’s claims, but experts have feared for more than a month that the test site was on the verge of crumbling since the nuclear blast. North Korea said it detonated a hydrogen bomb, calling it a “perfect success.” It was the country’s most powerful bomb tested to date and the blast was reportedly 10 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb that was dropped over Hiroshima at the end of World War II.  Japan Meteorological Agency's earthquake and tsunami observations division director Toshiyuki Matsumori speaks in front of a screen showing the seismic event that was indicated in North Korea and observed in Japan.

  The test triggered a 6.3-magnitude earthquake that day and multiple tremors have been detected from the area since then. Satellite images obtained by 38 North, which specializes in North Korea issues, showed several landslides occurred after the Sept. 3 test. Also a possible “collapse chimney crater” was seen on Mount Mantap, possibly caused by the underground tests.  It’s unclear if the mountain will collapse in the near future, but the report said there was “significant cracking” and “irreversible strain” on the land because of the nuclear test.  Some experts also said Mantap was suffering from “tired mountain syndrome” due to the stress on the ground, the Washington Post reported. Chinese scientists have also warned the mountain could collapse and release radiation. Radioactive xenon-133 was detected in South Korea after the test.

  Additionally on Tuesday, North Korea rebuked Trump and the U.S., saying "the Trump group's vicious vituperation against the DPRK is an expression of their frustration, fear and horror,” according to a statement released by state-run Korean Central News Agency. The day before, the Hermit Kingdom blamed Trump’s “extreme, direct and long threats” for driving them to obtain "complete nuclear deterrence.”  “The U.S. has to ponder over the possible consequences,” the statement said.

Two men have been arrested and charged for allegedly shooting at an off duty Border Patrol agent while he was driving down Interstate 10 in El Paso, Texas  Two men have been arrested for allegedly shooting at an off-duty Border Patrol agent as he was driving down I-10 in El Paso, Texas last Wednesday.   Rafael Roberto Valenzuela was taken into custody Friday and charged with engaging in organized criminal activity and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. He was booked into the El Paso County jail under a $200,000 bond.

  Raul Beltran was taken into custody Monday and booked into the county jail under a $75,000 bond with the same charges.   "Anytime the FBI suspects a member of the federal law enforcement community has been purposefully targeted in a violent assault, the FBI can pursue the individuals potentially for assault against a federal officer.  The FBI in coordination with our local, state and other federal law enforcement partners will aggressively identify and track down perpetrators,” said El Paso FBI Special Agent in Charge Emmerson Buie in a statement to Fox News. “The cooperation and leveraging of key resources from the different agencies was crucial in determining the motives of this violent attack."  On October 25, El Paso sheriff’s deputies responded to a call of shots fired around 5:30 a.m. The interstate was closed while FBI and sheriff’s office investigators looked around the scene for clues. Traffic cam footage shows cars being diverted off the highway while the agents carefully checked the guardrails, shoulder and highway.   The investigation began as a joint effort between the FBI, Border Patrol and the sheriff’s office. It since has been taken over by the sheriff’s office and arrests have been submitted to the state courts with the district attorney’s office.   At the same time agents were investigating the scene at I-10, multiple agencies responded to a neighborhood in east El Paso. It’s unclear if the investigation was related, but agents were seen photographing a red jeep and later towing it away.   “Usually it’s very quiet, very calm, and especially that early in the morning. It was different, definitely different,” neighborhood resident Brianna Martinez told KFOX.  Neighbors said they were asked general questions.  “They just asked certain questions like, ‘did you see anything, have you seen anything unusual?’ But we really didn’t,” Martinez said.   The investigation into the incident is ongoing.   Ray Bogan is a Fox News multimedia reporter based in El Paso, Texas.

Tales of tainted alcohol at Mexican resorts prompt senators to seek action  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  
                                    Abbey Conner died after authorities believe she drank tainted tequila at a Mexican resort.
                                    
                                  Nearly a year since a Wisconsin woman died at a Mexican resort after she became severely ill from drinking what is believed to be tainted liquor, officials are calling on the State Department and Office of the Inspector General on Monday to conduct additional investigations into Mexican resorts serving bootleg alcohol.  Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., the chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, sent the letter to Inspector General Steve Linick urging investigators to examine how the State Department “monitors, records and reports overseas incidents involving physical abuse or death after the potential consumption of tainted alcohol,” the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.  The call came after Wisconsin college student Abbey Conner, 20, died on a family vacation at Iberostar Paraiso del Mar, just north of Playa del Carmen, in January. Conner and her brother were drinking tequila, believed to be tainted, at the resort’s swim-up bar when they became ill. She was found unconscious in the pool and died in the hospital several days later. Her brother, who was also found unconscious next to her, survived the horrific ordeal.  Abbey Conner died in January after drinking alleged tainted alcohol at a Mexican resort. 
								
					          WARNING ISSUED OVER POSSIBLY TAINTED ALCOHOL IN MEXICO  In early September, a Missouri woman also said she was hospitalized after taking two shots of tequila at an all-inclusive Playa del Carmen resort that caused her to collapse.  The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel received more than 100 travelers’ accounts of experiencing similar events — drinking a minuscule amount of alcohol and blacking out or becoming violently ill moments later. Some people reported being robbed and raped because they were unconscious. Johnson and Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., have been pressing the State Department for more action and answers following Conner’s death.  Abbey Conner was at a Mexican resort with her brother when the two allegedly drank tainted liquor.
								
					          The number of reported incidents prompted the State Department to issue a warning to American tourists staying at the resorts. However, some senators, including Edward Markey, D-Mass., say the State Department is downplaying the risks of ingesting the potentially fatal liquid.  Mexican authorities have taken some action. Regulators raided 31 hot spots in Cancun and Playa del Carmen and seized 10,000 gallons of tainted alcohol from a manufacturing company in early August following Conner’s death.

House Republicans postpone tax reform rollout  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  On 'The Daily Briefing,' the House Ways and Means Committee chair says this is lawmakers' chance to lower taxes and grow jobs.  House Republicans have pushed back the release of their tax reform plan after failing to finalize last-minute changes to the legislation, the head of the tax-writing committee confirmed Tuesday.  House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said the decision to postpone the rollout was made "in consultation with President Trump and our leadership team."  "We are pleased with the progress we are making and we remain on schedule to take action and approve a bill at our Committee beginning next week," Brady added.  The details of the plan were initially scheduled to be unveiled on Wednesday, and Brady had promised as recently as 4 p.m. ET Tuesday that would be the case.  The committee had worked throughout the day and evening to produce a plan for the first overhaul of the nation's tax code in three decades.  Although they had settled on some key details — such as a cut in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent and maintaining the top personal income tax rate for the wealthy of 39.6 percent — other elements still had to be resolved.  Late Tuesday, reporters in the hall outside the committee's office could hear raised voices as members appeared to be arguing.  Trump has intensified his lobbying for the nearly $6 trillion tax overhaul plan, seeking a major legislative achievement after the collapse of the health care repeal.  Late Tuesday, Trump renewed his cheerleading on Twitter.  The Republican House members are working hard (and late) toward the Massive Tax Cuts that they know you deserve. These will be biggest ever!  The plan originally unveiled by Trump and congressional Republicans called for shrinking the number of tax brackets from seven to three, with respective tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent. That plan drew immediate criticism from Democrats, who complained it was too favorable to the wealthy and undermined Trump's rhetoric about it benefiting the middle class.  Brady did not answer directly when he was asked -- while leaving House Speaker Paul Ryan's suite Tuesday -- whether the drop in the corporate tax rate would happen immediately. But, he said: "I want as much growth right from Day One as I can."  Trump and congressional Republicans are eager for a significant legislative achievement after failing in their attempts to repeal the Obama-era health care law. Enacting a tax package is deemed critical for the Republicans to maintain their majorities in the 2018 elections.  Trump said he's directing Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn and other administration officials to stay behind when he heads for Asia on Friday so they can help sell the tax proposal. The White House said Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and adviser, had canceled plans to accompany the president to China and South Korea to help push the package.  The president said he was hopeful the House will approve the tax bill by Thanksgiving and that he can sign it into law by Christmas. But his overly optimistic timetable didn't address the concerns of lawmakers from states such as New York and New Jersey who have opposed a proposal to eliminate the federal deduction for state and local taxes, arguing it would hurt their constituents and subject them to being taxed twice.  A battle continues over contributions to 401(k) retirements accounts. The financial industry and some Republican lawmakers insist that the GOP plan not change the tax benefits of the popular savings vehicles, as has been floated by GOP leaders.  The current Republican plan calls for nearly doubling the standard deduction used by most average Americans to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for families, and increasing the per-child tax credit. In addition to slashing the corporate tax rate, it also seeks to repeal inheritance taxes on multimillion-dollar estates, a big break for the wealthy.

                                  Wendy Williams fainted on her TV show Tuesday morning.  The "Wendy Williams Show" host was in the middle of introducing a segment about Halloween costumes when she stood up and was visibly shaking before fainting and falling down.  A producer quickly rushed to Williams' side in a video shared on Twitter.  OMG. What just happens to Wendy Williams??? pic.twitter.com/m7joNyOy8K  After the commercial break, Williams addressed the scary moment.  "That was not a stunt. I overheated in my costume. I did pass out," she told the audience. "But you know what, I'm a champ and I'm back."  Wendy Williams came back after commercial break. Said she overheated in her costume. pic.twitter.com/jccZaQ9oK2  A rep for Williams told Fox News the host was "dehydrated" and was examined by medical professionals."  "She is ok and will continue the shows as planned. She will address this on-air tomorrow," her rep told us. "She has never missed a day of work and is looking forward on November 13th to her 1500th show."  You can find Sasha Savitsky on Twitter @SashaFB.

'Ten Commandments Judge' Roy Moore says he opposes 'religious test' for officeholders  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  Republican candidate for Alabama Senate seat rails against 'stagnancy' in Washington at the Family Research Council's Values Voter Summit.  Alabama Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore is famous for refusing to remove a statue of the Ten Commandments from a government building but told reporters Tuesday he doesn’t support a “religious test” for officeholders.  "There should be no religious test, no. That's against the Constitution," Moore said as he met with Republican senators at the Capitol on Tuesday, according to The Hill.  Moore, the former chief justice of Alabama’s Supreme Court who is popular with Christian conservatives in the state for his fights over cultural issues, was responding to questions about his 2006 statement that Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, a Muslim, shouldn't be allowed to serve in Congress.  He also accused reporters of portraying him unfairly.  "Well I'm a lot different than what the Washington Post has been printing," Moore said. "I don't hate people."  Moore was removed twice from his position on Alabama's Supreme Court; first for refusing to remove the Ten Commandments monument and then again when he ordered probate judges in the state not to grant same sex marriage licenses.  ALABAMA SENATE HOPEFUL ROY MOORE BLASTS WASHINGTON POST REPORTS  On Monday, Moore waded into another divisive social issue by calling for the impeachment of the federal judge who issued an order blocking the implementation of President Trump’s ban on transgender people serving in the military.  In a statement, he said U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly “should be impeached by the House of Representatives for unlawful usurpation of power” and “lack of good behavior” and should be “referred to the Senate for a vote on removal.”  Moore stated that as “recently as 2013, the American Psychiatric Association considered transgenderism to be a mental disorder.”  “The decision of a federal judge in the District of Columbia enjoining President Trump’s executive order on transgenderism in the military is absolutely ridiculous and is a perfect example of the outlandish doctrine of judicial supremacy whereby judges exalt themselves over the Constitution they are sworn to uphold,” he said.  Moore defeated incumbent-appointed Sen. Luther Strange in Alabama’s primary in September to fill the seat once held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He faces Democrat Doug Jones in December’s special election.  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.

                                  A 44-year-old Texas woman was arrested last week after she admitted to having sex with her daughter's teenage boyfriend, according to court records.  Claudia Yaneth Lopez of Pharr was charged with sexual assault of a child after she confessed, KGBT reported.  Police said an investigation began after they were contacted in August by a woman who said she found a suggestive text message on her son's phone and thought he had sex with Lopez.  The boy was younger than 17 at the time, according to court records obtained by the television station.  During an interview in September, the teen told police he had sex with the Lopez.  Public records don't show any previous criminal history for Lopez, who faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of the second-degree felony, the Dallas Morning News reported.

                                  The severed parts of nine bodies -- including two detached heads -- were reportedly discovered stored inside picnic coolers and covered with cat litter inside a man's apartment in Japan on Tuesday, leading to an arrest in the gruesome case.  Police originally were led to Takahiro Shiraishi's apartment in Zama, a city just outside the Japanese capital of Tokyo, while investigating the disappearance of a 23-year-old woman.  The missing woman was last seen on a security tape with Shiraishi earlier this month near his apartment, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported.  While searching the apartment, police said they found the body parts of eight women and one man stored in a number of coolers.   Suspect dismembered bodies in bathroom #nhk_world_news https://t.co/qz7VAbMwYL  Shiraishi told investigators he had killed the nine people, according to NHK.  "I killed them and did some work on the bodies in order to hide the evidence," he told police.  A police spokesman told Reuters the 27-year-old was arrested on suspicion of abandoning a body, although it was not clear whose body it was.

  “Some body parts were found in a picnic cooler, covered with cat litter,” the spokesman told the news agency.  Police think the woman may have met Shiraishi on a website for people with suicidal feelings.  The woman had previously posted messages to Twitter saying she wanted to die, but was afraid to do so alone, according to NHK.   Police plan to carry out DNA tests to identify the body parts, which included two severed heads, The Japan Times reported.  A neighbor of Shiraishi told the Times he noticed an “odd smell” in August that came from the apartment.  Members of the media gather near an apartment building where the severed remains of nine bodies were reportedly found.

The images have gone viral with more than 12,000 shares.  WASP RIPS BEE IN HALF IN VIRAL VIDEO  Turnbull said he removed the wrapper and released the fish back into the waters of Alberta.  "I was very surprised a fish could even survive like this," Turnbull told Fox News, adding that he has never caught anything like it before.  "I spoke to a biologist and the blockage was just behind its stomach so it would have been able to eat normally, just longer for digestion to take place," he said.

Facebook, Twitter, Google execs testify on Capitol Hill as part of Russia probe   This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  Lawyers for Google, Twitter, and Facebook testify in front of Congress and say they found more evidence Russian groups may have tried to influence the 2016 election  A Facebook executive told a Senate panel Tuesday that they “should have had a broader lens” into currency used for payments of political advertisements on their social media platform during the 2016 presidential election.  In the first of a series of hearings on Capitol Hill this week related to how Russian actors meddled in the 2016 campaigns on social media,  representatives of tech giants Facebook, Twitter and Google testified before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism that they still have much to do in their efforts to stop the abuse of their platforms by improper or fake users.  “How did Facebook, which prides itself in connecting data points, somehow not make the connection that electoral ads, paid for in [Russian] rubles were coming from Russia?” Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., pressed Facebook’s legal counsel.  “In hindsight, we should’ve had a broader lens,” Facebook’s General Counsel Colin Stretch said. “It’s a signal we should have been alert to.”  Franken pressed Stretch over whether Facebook would commit to not taking political ad payments in currencies other than dollars.  FACEBOOK, GOOGLE, TWITTER: HOW TECH GIANTS ARE INVOLVED IN THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION   “Just answer yes or no,” Franken said in a heated exchange. “You’re the chief legal counsel.”  Stretch said that Facebook was “not going to permit political advertising by foreign actors.”  “My goal for you is to think through this stuff a little bit better,” Franken fired back.  Last week, Facebook said it would verify political ad buyers in federal elections and would build transparency tools to link ads to the Facebook pages of their sponsors.  But in the 2016 election, Facebook estimated that “roughly 29 million people” were served content in their Facebook News Feeds directly from Russia’s Internet Research Agency’s 80,000 posts. The IRA is known for promoting pro-Russian government positions.  Facebook estimated that approximately “126 million people” may have been served content from a page associated with the IRA, noting that that is “approximately 1 out of 23,000 pieces of content.”  “Much of the content we’ve seen is essentially imitative of social causes, many meaningful ones to the Facebook community, and it’s what makes this so vile and cynical,” Stretch told lawmakers. “It’s an attempt to exploit divisions in our society.”  Committee Chairman Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., asked the tech giants whether nations like Iran or North Korea could interfere in a U.S. election as Russia did.  “Certainly potentially,” Stretch said. “The Internet is borderless.”  A Twitter representative testified that it uncovered and shut down 2,752 accounts linked to Russia’s IRA, and said that 5 percent of 330 million active user accounts are “false, spam or automated.” The Russia-linked accounts put out 1.4 million election-related tweets from September through November 15 of last year, nearly half of which were automated.  Twitter also found nine Russian accounts that purchased advertisements coming from the state-backed news service RT. Twitter said last week it would no longer accept ads from RT and Sputnik, another state-sponsored news outlet, and would donate the $1.9 million it earned from RT since 2011 to support external research into political uses of Twitter.  Google said this week that it would verify the identify of the election-related ad buys. It will provide a public database of election ads detailing who purchased each one, and will publish a transparency report on election ads as well.  A bipartisan group of senators introduced earlier this month legislation that would regulate advertisements purchased for online platforms. The legislation is aimed at hitting “archaic laws” that allow content and purchasers of advertisements to be hidden from the public, according to a Senate aide who helped draft the Honest Ads Act backed by Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn; Mark Warner, D-Va.; and John McCain, R-Ariz.

  Fox News has reached out to Twitter for comment for this story. Teigen's reps were looking into the matter when contacted by Fox News.  TWITTER ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE AD TRANSPARENCY AFTER RUSSIAN-BACKED SCANDAL  Twitter has come under attack for abuse on its platform, with the company actively trying to curtail it, to mixed results. In 2016, companies such as Salesforce.com and Disney looked at acquiring the Jack Dorsey-led company, only to call off the attempts, due in part to the abuse on the platform.  The abuse has been cited by experts as one of the reasons it was not purchased. Former New York Times editor Quentin Hardy said he spoke to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff about the trolling issue, and he confirmed that trolls were part of the reason Salesforce dropped its bid.  Actually, I did raise it with @Benioff when I saw him on Oct. 5, and he did say that was a problem, among others.  In November 2016, the company wrote a blog post, detailing some of the progress it has made in curtailing online abuse.   In the post, Twitter explained that it was expanding its mute function, which lets users mute accounts they don’t want to see tweets from, to muting keywords, phrases, and even entire conversations.   It also put a spotlight on its hateful conduct policy, which "prohibits specific conduct that targets people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease."   Lastly, the company said it had retrained its support teams on its policies, "including special sessions on cultural and historical contextualization of hateful conduct, and implemented an ongoing refresher program," while improving internal tools to deal with abuse in a more effective manner.

Kevin Spacey accused of grabbing a man's crotch in a bar   This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  Gay rights advocates disappointed in actor Kevin Spacey's attempt to link his sexuality with the alleged sexual misconduct.  A second Kevin Spacey accuser has come forward claiming the actor groped him in a Los Angeles bar in 2003.  Tony Montana, who first spoke to Radar Online, told Fox News the "House of Cards" star approached him at Coronet Pub.    Montana said Spacey grabbed his crotch.   "People react differently to trauma," said Montana, who was then in his 30s. "With what happened to me was an immediate form of helplessness. The bar was my safe place. This person of out nowhere, who I know is famous, who is misbehaving and has a license to misbehave and this is happening to me.  "I was in a horror movie. No one could see it... I used to compete in mixed martial arts. [I] pulled his thumb back. He then followed me into the restroom and he followed me in. It was all very strange."  He told Radar Online Spacey, now 58, "was telling me to come with him, to leave the bar."   Montana claimed after Spacey put his hand on Montana's crotch the star said, "This designates ownership.”  Montana decided to come forward after actor Anthony Rapp claimed Spacey behaved inappropriately towards him when he was 14 years old.  "I want people to know," Montana told us. "I considered it into my decision that Spacey might try to sue but this is more important to get this out."  Spacey did not return Fox News' request for comment.   Fox News.com Reporter and FOX411 host Diana Falzone covers celebrity news and interviews some of today's top celebrities and newsmakers.  You can follow her on Twitter @dianafalzone.

                                  The father of the famous baby hippo Fiona died Tuesday at the age of 36, the Cincinnati Zoo announced.  Henry was struggling with health issues for months and had lost "hundreds of pounds," according to the zoo.  After taking an "obvious downward turn" in the past few days, the zoo said Henry was weak and unsteady and staffers made the decision to euthanize the hippo after concluding his "quality of life would not improve."  Henry's death came after his daughter Fiona became a social media starlet when she was born six weeks early but managed to survive and thrive.  FISHERMAN CATCHES FISH THAT GREW AROUND A DRINK WRAPPER  “After watching Fiona fight, defy the odds and literally make history, it feels especially unfair and defeating to have to accept this outcome for Henry," Wendy Rice, Africa Head Keeper, said in a news release. "While our time with him has been short in quantity, no one can deny that his quality of life before becoming ill was exceptional."  Henry had mated with Bibi, the zoo’s 18-year-old female hippo, and followed her everywhere. The two were put together when the zoo's Hippo Cove exhibit opened in July 2016, and Fiona was born shortly after.  FLORIDA MAN SCARES BLACK BEAR OUT OF HIS GARAGE  The zoo said Tuesday the average life expectancy for a Nile hippopotamus such as Henry is 35 years.  Officials plan a full necropsy to help veterinarians at the zoo understand what caused his death.

                                  A Florida woman who suspected her mother's live-in partner was having an affair got quite the surprise when she discovered videos of herself undressing and in the nude on a family computer, officials said.   Matthew Bordeaux, 48, was arrested Sunday and charged with video voyeurism after the woman's daughter looked at files under Bordeaux's profile on the family computer and discovered the man had taken pictures of her with two secret cameras, authorities said.  The cameras were concealed inside an electrical wall socket in her bedroom and an AC adapter in a shared bathroom, according to court records obtained by the Sun Sentinel.  Matthew Bordeaux is accused of using a hidden camera to record a woman undressing.

  Bordeaux, who has lived with the mother and daughter "as a family" for seven years, had more than 2,500 images taken by the two cameras, Sunrise police said.   According to court records, the victim told investigators that when the three of them moved from a nearby town, Bordeaux gave her the wall socket to use, saying it was "too expensive" to leave behind.   A memory card on the device allowed Bordeaux to transfer the images to a computer, where he kept pictures in a folder that was not password-protected.  Bordeaux appeared in court Monday, where he was ordered held on $10,000 bond.  The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Eric Metaxas: The real Martin Luther  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  Spirited Debate: Eric Metaxas on how Martin Luther's actions have impacted history, 500 years later, and his new book 'Martin Luther: The Man Who Rediscovered God and Changed the World.'  Editor's note: The following is an excerpt from Eric Metaxas' new book,  "MARTIN LUTHER: The Man Who Rediscovered God and Changed the World."  One of the greatest challenges in telling the story of Martin Luther is distancing him from the endless fables, myths, and tall tales told about him in the last five centuries.  During his lifetime, Luther’s celebrity grew at such a pace that the momentum of it could not be slowed even by his death. In fact, the magma of his celebrity soon cooled into hagiographic stone, such that much of what the world has come to “know” about him is fiction.  The most well-known ”facts“ of his life illustrate the point.  First, he was born into a family of peasants, the poor son of a miner who was raised in a home humble and cramped; second, his hardscrabble upbringing was a brutal one in which his dour working-class father buffeted him so viciously that it warped his psyche, causing him to see God the Father as a similarly glowering and sadistic figure to be placated and assuaged in endlessly humiliating religious contortions—or to be avoided entirely.   Third, it was a literal bolt of fire from the heavens that caused the jumpy twenty-one-year-old suddenly to blurt out a binding vow—one he had never previously considered but that in his abject fear he indeed spoke—and then felt duty bound to honor the rest of his born days, thus leading him to become a monk.   Fourth, it was on a trip to Rome that he was so shocked at the blasphemous devilry of that vile city that he decided he must destroy the soft and decadent Italian church and remake it in his own uncompromising and upright German image.   Fifth, he began this lifelong project by angrily and defiantly hammering his damning accusations against Rome onto the very door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, thus putting the quivering pope on notice that his deeds had been weighed in the balance and found wanting.   Sixth, after his great stand at the Diet of Worms—where he said, “Here I stand. I can do no other!”—he fled to the Wartburg, where in his overflowing umbrage he took on the devil personally and at least once punctuated his fury by hurling a pot of ink at the fiend who dared to trespass his quarters. Indeed, anyone who doubts this need only go to the Wartburg to see the swart blots themselves, still staining the wall of his cell these five centuries later.   Seventh, the nun he married escaped from her nunnery by hiding inside a large barrel that had only just been emptied of herring. In fact, all of the twelve nuns hid in filthy herring barrels secured to the wagon that hurtled them away to freedom.  These important details have been recounted innumerable times and are being confidently recounted this minute, told in tours of Luther sites around Germany in many languages, being written and read in otherwise excellent books about Luther, and posted in online articles and blogs. But not a single one of these seven things is true. They are each sloppy glosses on the actual facts and have over time congealed and finally ossified into the marmoreal narrative that has existed for half a millennium.   Parson Weems’s pious legends of Washington chopping down cherry trees and casting silver dollars across the wide Potomac persisted for about 150 years, but these false details about Luther have persisted for more than three times as long.   Their cultural roots are therefore that much deeper. It is my hope that "Martin Luther" will do its humble part in uprooting them.

                                  Last week, yet another incidence of racist defacement turned out to be a hoax. It seems that in many of the more high-profile racist graffiti incidents either the perpetrator has not been found or has turned out to be someone wanting to draw attention to racism through the use of graphic and shocking vandalism.  The latest hoax incident, which had occurred at Eastern Michigan University over 13 months ago, was anti-black graffiti done by a black man. Following the discovery of the vandalism back then, protesters had marched through the streets of Ypsilanti, arms joined, chanting "No justice, no peace."  The hoaxer got exactly what he wanted, a lot of attention and a spike of fear in people.  In the 1980’s, New York City launched the The Clean Train Movement.  The new policy was that no subway car left the depot if it was covered in graffiti.   It’s because the graffiti--both the hoax and the non-hoax kind-- garners such a reaction that it keeps happening. What if we took a different path upon discovery of this kind of racist graffiti? What if we painted over it swiftly and went on about our day?  In the 1980’s, New York City launched the The Clean Train Movement.  The new policy was that no subway car left the depot if it was covered in graffiti. At the time, “taggers,” as graffiti artists call themselves, would spend entire nights covering whole subway cars in their colorful work. The payoff was seeing the car in action, running through their city. When the city cracked down on that, the graffiti ended. The incentive was gone. No one would see their graffiti except for the transit workers quickly painting over it.  We need to apply the same principle to random racist or anti-Semitic graffiti. If we mostly ignore it, and paint over it, the racist or hoaxer doesn’t get the satisfaction of our reaction. They don’t see us march through the streets or write hand-wringing Op-Eds about what is going wrong with our society. We take away the satisfaction of the crime.  As a Jew, of course it disturbs me when swastikas are painted on synagogues, as happened at a synagogue in Manhattan just last week, or other similar racist incidents. But I don’t draw the larger conclusion that New Yorkers are Nazis, or ok with Nazism. Similarly when graffiti mocking 9/11 turned up all over New York City a few years ago, it was clear it wasn’t representative of the city’s residents.  It’s important to not ratchet up the tension. If we could dial back the immediate reaction to words on a wall, we might find that it happens much less often. Let’s not give racists, or hoaxers, what they want.

Rep. Mike Johnson: US must act to stop foreign subversion of our democracy  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  Fox News contributor Deneen Borelli and Democratic strategist Michael Starr Hopkins debate on 'Fox & Friends First.'  Much has been said in recent months, if not days, about the aggressive agendas of hostile foreign actors to undermine our nation’s democratic processes. The American people are rightfully concerned about these subversive efforts to taint our public policy and our elections, and Congress must do all it can to address the issue.  It has been almost 70 years since Congress first enacted the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) to limit and keep track of outside influences. The law created critical disclosure requirements for any lobbying group that works on behalf of foreign interests here in the United States, so their advocacy and activities can be properly evaluated in light of their associations.  Clearly, much has changed in the world since FARA became law in 1938. Subsequent statutes have added ambiguity to its application and limited its enforcement, and existing loopholes have been exploited to allow foreign nations to funnel millions of dollars through outside groups aiming to influence Congress—without any disclosure to the federal government or the American people.  Our susceptibility to foreign aggression is a serious matter. Today, adversaries like China, Russia and Iran have become increasingly adept at inserting their agendas into our politics. Recent evidence suggests that nations funding terrorist groups have found new methods to circumvent our protections and lobby lawmakers without disclosure. Some U.S. intelligence officials have characterized their actions as a “relentless assault,” and many have warned that our outdated laws need to be revised to address the growing problem.  To make matters worse, the federal agencies tasked with monitoring these foreign influences, such as the Department of Justice National Security Division (NSD), have little to no authority to actually enforce the existing disclosure requirements.  Absent extreme circumstances, the NSD is typically required to wait for a voluntary disclosure by a party before taking any action—even when wrongdoing is suspected. Because of these limitations, only seven criminal cases have been prosecuted in the past 49 years, and not a single civil case has been brought since 1991.    Recent examples highlight the need for change. Consider the situation in 2014, when the New York Times uncovered documents showing a clear violation of the law and listing the violator’s name and place of employment. Due to flaws in our statutes, the NSD was unable to investigate the matter because it lacked receipt of necessary disclosure paperwork—which the violator himself had discretion to withhold.    Similarly, under the Obama administration, although evidence was presented that top administration officials were lobbied on behalf of foreign nations, those agents remain unregistered.  Unfortunately, incidents like these are not isolated. For more than 40 years, both independent and official government reports have issued warnings about the diminishing effectiveness of our disclosure laws.   In September 2016, the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General (OIG) issued a report on the subject following its exhaustive review. The report outlined longstanding deficiencies and concluded the U.S. government lacks a comprehensive enforcement strategy and the adequate tools to combat foreign influence abuses.  Although the 2016 report echoed similar conclusions reached in 1974, 1980 and 1990—until today, nothing has been done to correct the problem. While foreign adversaries continue to take advantage of this inaction and exploit FARA’s glaring loopholes and exemptions, the OIG believes this is an issue of national security, and experts insist reform is now an absolute necessity.  Using commonsense recommendations from years of investigative reports, I have introduced legislation to address the dangerous shortcomings in current law and remove grey areas that have been used to circumvent disclosure requirements. These long overdue reforms will help restore transparency and enhance our nation’s defenses by fortifying our laws and allowing the NSD to do its job.  Regardless of our individual policy preferences, all Americans can agree that the integrity of our democratic processes and the security of our country should never be compromised. Our legislation, the "Disclosing Foreign Influence Act," will be an important new tool to help modernize transparency efforts and maintain these critical objectives.  The American people deserve to know when foreign adversaries are attempting to meddle in our domestic affairs. This bill will help bring those efforts to light.

Maybe white folks should just dress up as crackers for Halloween?  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  From Trump to Pennywise, we've got you covered with a look at some of this year's top trending Halloween costumes.  Trick-or-Treaters are having a difficult time finding Halloween costumes that won’t get them in trouble with the identity politics and social justice crowd.  Click here for a free subscription to Todd’s Newsletter – a must-read for conservatives!  Folks can deal with flesh-eating zombies and demon-possessed children. But accusations of cultural appropriation? Well, that’s a whole different story.  Let’s be honest – nobody wants to tangle with a bunch of perpetually-offended liberals who were triggered by a white guy wearing a sombrero. Most folks would rather climb into a storm drain and take their chances with a deranged circus clown.  Two Disney costumes are causing quite a bit of “cultural appropriation and white privilege” controversy this year – Moana, the Polynesian character, and Elsa, from “Frozen.”  “I had some reservations regarding both costume choices…about cultural appropriation and the power/privilege carried by Whiteness, and about Whiteness and standards of beauty,” wrote Sachi Feris on the Raising Race Conscious Children blog.  In their estimation dressing up like a Polynesian is akin to wearing black face – or calling a white Southerner a “Cracker.”  The blog also posted a guide urging white parents to use Halloween as an opportunity to “dismantle white supremacy.”  “White parents who want to dismantle White supremacy have a special burden to check their entitlement on Halloween – and make sure that their children’s costume choices are not reinforcing a culture of racism,” the bloggers warned.  In other words, no Colin Kaepernick costumes, kids.  “White people have been dressing up in costumes ‘in good fun’ with little regard to whom they might be offending,” the bloggers wrote.  I think they might be talking about you folks who dressed up as President Trump’s border wall.  The Raising Race Conscious Children bloggers also want moms and dads to use Halloween as an educational opportunity. It’s not just about candy corn and orange marshmallow circus peanuts.  “Halloween is an opportunity to have a conversation with your child about race, power and privilege,” they wrote.  I must confess - it is indeed a burden for us pale faces -- celebrating Halloween without culturally appropriating.  But this year- I may have stumbled upon the foolproof costume. I've decided to dress up in a button down Oxford shirt, with khakis and penny loafers. If anybody asks -- I'm a Cracker.

Liz Peek: Hillary Clinton desperately needs Mueller to prove Russian collusion  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  Trump campaign aides charged in special counsel's probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.'  Monday was not a good day for President Trump, but it was an even worse day for Hillary Clinton.   Indictments handed down by Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged Trump’s former campaign chair Paul Manafort and close associate Rick Gates with a slew of white collar crimes, including failure to register as a foreign agent, tax evasion and money laundering, an embarrassment to the president. But, some have described the indictments as weak, since they focus on Manafort making false FARA filings, or not registering as a foreign agent, a charge brought by the government only six times since 1966, and which resulted in only one conviction. Enforcement of the FARA law is generally not rigorous.  More important, there was no mention of Russia, or of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Hillary needs Mueller to connect those dots.  In Hillary’s world, she campaigned admirably and had the better message; it was Moscow that did her in.  Also released Monday was news that a Trump campaign volunteer, George Papadopoulos pled guilty Oct. 5 to lying to federal agents. Papadopoulos was brought aboard the campaign as an expert on Greece, but promoted various unsuccessful attempts to set up a meeting between Donald Trump and Putin. None of his efforts bore fruit; emails suggest he was rebuffed by senior members of the campaign on several occasions.   Nonetheless, his plea is viewed as potentially damaging to the Trump camp, since language in the indictment suggests he may have acted as a cooperating witness; in other words, he may have been persuaded in recent months to wear a wire. As someone pretty far down the food chain, it is unclear what information he might provide.  None of this will satisfy Secretary Clinton’s desire to blame Vladimir Putin for her astonishing loss to an untutored and underfinanced Donald Trump.   She has written extensively about the suspicious regard that Trump voiced for the Kremlin leader during the election, and of the numerous points of contact between members of the Trump entourage and suspected Russian operatives.   In Hillary’s world, she campaigned admirably and had the better message; it was Moscow that did her in.  That narrative took a hit in recent days as proof emerged that the Clinton campaign itself had indirectly paid Russian sources millions of dollars for salacious and discredited material on Donald Trump. The Clintonistas and the DNC hired Fusion GPS to assemble the notorious Trump dossier, which was created by former British spy Christopher Steele with the apparent help of Kremlin-linked informants.  It also came to light recently that the Obama White House was aware of a wide-ranging FBI investigation into Russian efforts to secure uranium reserves in the U.S., involving bribery and racketeering that took place during the early years of the Obama administration.  During the same period, Russian interests mysteriously donated millions to a Canadian affiliate of the Clinton Foundation, which Hillary failed to report, and a Moscow bank with ties to Putin also paid Bill Clinton half a million dollars for a speech. In 2010 she, along with the heads of other agencies represented on the CFIUS panel, green-lighted the sale of Uranium One to Russia's Atomic Energy Agency, Rosatom, against the recommendation of national security advisors.  Americans are left to wonder…was it Trump that colluded with Russia, or was it Hillary? Did Putin pick sides, or was he out mainly to destabilize our body politic? If it was the latter, he has succeeded beyond his wildest dreams.  The investigation into Russian meddling has become a political football, with Democrats using allegations of collusion to discredit Trump’s extraordinary win.  Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Mark Warner – they are all-in on the Trump-Russia meme, and notably silent on the recent developments noted above.  Meanwhile, the tens of millions of Americans who voted for Donald Trump are angry that his victory has been met with steadfast resistance and obstruction.   Democrats (and some Republicans) have thrown up endless roadblocks, among other things delaying the staffing of vital government posts and hindering efforts to fix our collapsing health care system.   Trump supporters question the integrity of the FBI, which apparently also paid Fusion GPS, the impartiality of the Mueller investigation and have long since tuned out the biased liberal media.  None of this is good for our country. Which is why the sooner the Mueller investigation comes to an end the better. Despite all the sturm und drang about Russian collusion and the dire warnings of Trump incompetence or worse, Americans are the most upbeat they have been in decades, the stock market is soaring and the economy is showing every sign of accelerating.   This good news appalls Democrats, who still lack a coherent message that can compete with a strengthening economy. A rising tide tends to lift all boats and drown out the left’s politics of envy; what else do they have?  Hillary, in particular, has only excuses. She will continue to hope for proof positive that Donald Trump’s victory was not a victory for putting America first, for strengthening our military, for reestablishing the rule of law and tightening our borders, for rolling back regulations of businesses and making our tax code simpler and fairer. She needs Robert Mueller to prove Trump’s win illegitimate, and the handiwork of Russia.  Hillary and her fellow Democrats want the suffocating cloud of suspicion to linger, and, given the enormous resources that Mueller has assembled, they will probably get their wish.

Cal Thomas: How Congress hides its Harvey Weinstein problem  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  A look at the sexual harassment allegations made against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and what's next for him  It should surprise no one that when it comes to sexual harassment, members of Congress and their staffs are treated differently from the rest of us.  The Washington Post notes a law in place since 1995 under which anyone accusing a lawmaker of sexual harassment can file a lawsuit, but only if they first agree to go through counseling and mediation, possibly lasting several months.  If you think that’s a double standard and outrageous, it gets worse. Should a settlement occur — and many don’t for the same reason women are fearful of accusing bosses in every profession — the member doesn’t pay. You and I do. The money comes from a special U.S. Treasury fund, and the payments are confidential. In other words, taxpayers are subsidizing boorish, even criminal behavior to protect the reputations of our great leaders, who can’t be bothered with the standards they set for the little people they are supposed to serve.  The Post found that while most settlements are small — compared with the tens of millions paid by Fox News — the amount still totaled $15.2 million paid to 235 claimants from 1997 to 2014.  Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., had it right when she told the newspaper, “It is not a victim-friendly process. It is an institution-protection process.”  Is there any member of Congress who can defend this? If so, they should be voted out of office. If not, the members should be subject to the same laws as everyone else and forced to pay settlements out of their own pockets, and then voted out of office.  After having tolerated sexual predators in their midst for decades, Hollywood is taking the first tentative steps to address the issue. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has announced it will be establishing a code of conduct for its members. One hopes it will have teeth and that violators “will never work in this town again.”  The entertainment industry needs to go further. While there was much to criticize about the sometimes prudish and hypocritical Motion Picture Production Code that forced actors to keep their clothes on and avoid foul language in films produced from 1930 to 1968, it could be said that films then were mostly not complicit in the lowering of moral standards. That would come later with television, which began pushing against FCC regulations, and then cable and satellite TV, which have no FCC restrictions. Hollywood responded to their loss of audience by “going low” to lure people back into theaters.  Add to this pornographic films, which have done more not only to objectify women, but also to give men who view them the idea that women are hypersexual and welcome their advances. The social consequences from this filth have been documented. They include marital breakups and establishing a view of women in the minds of some men that no woman can — or should — live down to.  Does this material have an effect on young female and male minds? Of course it does, or they wouldn’t produce it. Can it lead to sexual harassment, and worse? It kills the spirit as much as a poison can kill the body.  The entertainment industry has a lot to answer for. Instead of taking baby steps, it should take giant leaps. If it doesn’t, this stuff will continue, from Capitol Hill to Hollywood and everywhere in between.  Cal Thomas is America's most widely syndicated op-ed columnist.

Gregg Jarrett: Still no evidence of Trump-Russia 'collusion' - but Hillary is a different matter  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  Rep. Dana Rohrabacher tells Tucker he has been trying to get a hearing on the Clintons-Russia connection for months. #Tucker  Over the weekend, the mainstream media was absolutely giddy with delight upon learning there would be an indictment by special counsel, Robert Mueller.    This was proof positive, they insisted, that Trump “colluded” with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election.  Their exuberance was the equivalent of a two day-long tailgate party. Too bad it was premature.   Manafort & Gates  The celebration came to a crashing end when the indictments of Paul Manafort and his business associate, Rick Gates, were unsealed Monday morning.  It turns out the charges are, basically, a tax fraud case.  The two men stand accused of hiding their income from their lobbying work for Ukraine in order to avoid paying taxes, then lying about it.  That’s it.  The 31-page indictment makes no mention of Trump or Russia or “collusion.”  The media seemed as dejected as a kid who wakes up on Christmas morning, only to find there are no presents under the tree.  Gee whiz.    The truth is, it should have come as no surprise to anyone, much less the media, that Manafort was in legal jeopardy for his business dealings.  The FBI raided his home over the summer.  It was later learned that the FBI wiretapped his conversations as far back as 2014.  And it was widely reported that Manafort had been told by Mueller’s team that he would be criminally charged.  It could be said that Hillary Clinton is the one who was conspiring with the Russians by breaking campaign finance laws with impunity.  The media became even more dispirited when they read through the indictment, discovering that nearly all of Manafort’s alleged wrongdoing substantially pre-dates his brief stint as chairman of the Trump campaign.  In other words, there is no connection to either Trump or his campaign.   Somewhere, I’m sure, ABC’s Martha Raddatz and CNN’s Van Jones were crying.  Again.  Just like the tears they shed on camera election night when Hillary lost.   Papadopoulos  But wait.  Shortly after the indictments were unsealed, the media’s spirits were suddenly boosted when the special counsel revealed that a former adviser to Trump pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian national during his time on the Trump campaign.  Surely this was evidence of illegal “collusion,” right?  Wrong.  George Papadopoulos pled guilty to a single charge of making a false statement to the FBI.  He was not charged with so-called “collusion” because no such crime exists in American statutory law, except in anti-trust matters.  It has no application to elections and political campaigns.  It is not a crime to talk to a Russian. Not that the media would ever understand that.  They have never managed to point to a single statute that makes “colluding” with a foreign government in a political campaign a crime, likely because it does not exist in the criminal codes.  To put it plainly, Mueller is tasked with finding a crime that does not exist in the law.  It is a legal impossibility.  He is being asked to do something that is manifestly unattainable.    But that did not stop them from accusing Donald Trump, Jr., of illegally conspiring with the Russians when he met with a Russian lawyer to obtain information on Hillary Clinton.  What law did he break?  None.  The Federal Election Commission has made it clear that it is perfectly lawful for foreign nationals to be involved in campaigns, as long as they are not paid and do not donate money.  Which brings us to Hillary Clinton.  Hillary Clinton  It is against the law for the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee to funnel millions of dollars to a British spy and to Russian sources in order to obtain the infamous and discredited Trump “dossier.”  The Federal Election Campaign Act (52 USC 30101) prohibits foreign nationals and governments from giving or receiving money in U.S. campaigns.  It also prohibits the filing of false or misleading campaign reports to hide the true purpose of the money (52 USC 30121).  This is what Clinton and the DNC appear to have done.  Most often the penalty for violating this law is a fine, but in egregious cases, like this one, criminal prosecutions have been sought and convictions obtained.  In this sense, it could be said that Hillary Clinton is the one who was conspiring with the Russians by breaking campaign finance laws with impunity.  But that’s not all.  Damning new evidence appears to show that Clinton used her office as Secretary of State to confer benefits to Russia in exchange for millions of dollars in donations to her foundation and cash to her husband.  Secret recordings, intercepted emails, financial records, and eyewitness accounts allegedly show that Russian nuclear officials enriched the Clintons at the very time Hillary presided over a governing body which unanimously approved the sale of one-fifth of America’s uranium supply to Russia.   If this proves to be a corrupt “pay-to-play” scheme, it would constitute a myriad of crimes, including bribery (18 USC 201-b), mail fraud (18 USC 1341), and wire fraud (18 USC 1343).  It might also qualify for racketeering charges (18 USC 1961-1968), if her foundation is determined to have been used as a criminal enterprise.   Despite all the incriminating evidence, Clinton has managed to avoid being pursued by a special counsel.  Trump, on the other hand, is being chased by Robert Mueller and his team, notwithstanding a dearth of evidence.   Robert Mueller  The indictments of Manafort and Gates now present a unique opportunity to challenge the authority of the special counsel.   Until now, no one had legal “standing” to argue in court that the appointment of Mueller was illegal.  The criminal charges change all that.  The two defendants will be able to argue before a judge that Mueller’s appointment by Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein violated the special counsel law.   As I pointed out in a column last May, the law (28 CFR 600) grants legal authority to appoint a special counsel to investigate crimes.  Only crimes.  He has limited jurisdiction.  Yet, in his order appointing Mueller as special counsel (Order No. 3915-2017), Rosenstein directed him to investigate “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.”   It fails to identify any specific crimes, likely because none are applicable.   To put it plainly, Mueller is tasked with finding a crime that does not exist in the law.  It is a legal impossibility.  He is being asked to do something that is manifestly unattainable.   If the federal judge agrees, Mueller and his team would be disbanded by judicial order.  The Department of Justice would have to seek a new indictment of Manafort and Gates without the special counsel or drop the case entirely.   The naming of Robert Mueller was tainted with disqualifying conflicts of interest from the beginning.  Fired FBI Director James Comey admitted he leaked presidential memos to the media for the sole purpose of triggering the appointment of a special counsel who just happens to be Comey’s longtime friend, ally and partner.   It is no coincidence that Rosenstein appointed Mueller.  We now know both men were overseeing the corrupt Uranium One sale which involved Russian bribes, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering.  They appear to have kept it secret, even hiding it from Congress which would surely have cancelled the transaction involving a vital national security asset.  A cover-up?  It has the stench of one.   How can Americans have confidence in the outcome of the Trump-Russia matter if the integrity and impartiality of Mueller and Rosenstein has been compromised by their suspected cover-up of the Clinton-Russia case?   Both men should resign.   And a new special counsel should be appointed – this time to investigate Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump.     Gregg Jarrett joined FOX News Channel (FNC) in 2002 and is based in New York.

I'm a millennial and I can sit through the World Series  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  Many stars are hoping for a series-deciding Game 7 between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Houston Astros.  As the Astros and Dodgers moved into extra innings in game two of the World Series last week, fans seemed to light up and lean forward in their seats, as if tenth innings were the reason they watched games.  Even this Mets fan, originally torn about whom to root for in the 2017 Fall Classic, sat on the edge of my seat in disbelief as Houston clawed its way to a win against Los Angeles.  Game two – a game ESPN described as “so completely insane and ridiculous that you wouldn't believe what happened if you didn't watch it” – was a cocktail of suspense and excitement that reminded fans why they follow baseball … biting our nails as the 11-inning back-and-forth unfolded – with the Astros tying it up in the ninth, two Dodgers homeruns answered to tie it up again in the tenth, and the Astros finally managing to squeeze out a 7-6 win in the eleventh.  Game five was another mindblower, with the Astros winning 13-12 after an exhausting 10-inning home run bonanza that winning pitcher Joe Musgrove called “the craziest game of my life.”  The sweetness of these wins, however, was missed by many young people who have written off learning the rules of such a “boring” game.  One could say a good baseball game is like a good song. Punctuating the rhythm of the game are crescendos of excitement, which are only sweetened by the quieter parts.  Many young Americans were raised on football, soccer, or basketball, noble sports no doubt, but somewhere along the line they found themselves incapable of sitting through America’s pastime.  In the age of shorter and shorter attention spans, those in their teens and 20s who cannot sit through a Marx Brothers movie, much less a baseball game, are missing out.  Baseball is poetry.  The suspenseful quiet that takes up a large part of the game leaves room for the players’ human quirks to steal the spotlight, fascinating fans as every movement tugs on the fate of the game.  Detroit Tigers pitcher Mark Fidrych, for instance, talked to himself on the mound in the 1970s, sparking the lore that he was really talking to the ball. Another pitching legend, Gaylord Perry, twitched before pitches on purpose, driving batters up the wall.  The New York Mets were home to some of baseball’s greatest characters, leading Manager Casey Stengel to say that his beloved (but losing) “Amazins” “are a much improved ball club; now we lose in extra innings!”  The rules of baseball also set the groundwork for artful suspense. In game seven of the World Series, the ninth inning, with two out, bases loaded, two strikes on the batter, the batting team losing by no less than three runs, the losing team can still win the entire championship on a single pitch.  No other game has anything like that.   It was that sort of scenario that made famed Mets coach Yogi Berra warn, “It ain’t over till it’s over.”  True, some modern changes threaten the game. Even during the span of this writer’s childhood, games at Shea Stadium, Citifield, and the old Yankee Stadium got louder with more distractions and sideshows in case fans were getting bored. Some of the extras, like team mascots (Mr. Met!) and the kiss-cam are a blast, but the game itself was always the most exciting part.  Diehard fans of other sports like football, basketball, hockey or soccer, may object to baseball being exciting. There is none of the standing around, looking at the grass and kicking the dirt that goes on in baseball in those other pasttimes.  However, one could say a good baseball game is like a good song. Punctuating the rhythm of the game are crescendos of excitement, which are only sweetened by the quieter parts.  I remember around 2002 my dad took my little sister and me to a Mets game at Shea. My sister, around seven at the time, announced on the way there that she would catch a foul ball in her cap, showing us from the car back seat how she would hold her cap up.  “That would be nice, pet lamb,” my dad said.  “No, I know I am!” she told him.  She caught a ball - in her cap - that day.  A little kid can sit for hours holding a cap up in hopes of taking a piece of the game home. Surely the rest of us bored grown-ups can take some time to appreciate a game that has it all, from grit to art.

Luke Bryan designed a Chevy Silverado for huntin' and fishin'  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.

                                  There have been plenty of songs written about trucks, but a truck named after a song? That’s a new one.  Country superstar Luke Bryan has teamed up with Chevrolet to design a custom Silverado inspired by his “Huntin’, Fishin’ and Lovin’ Every Day” motto.  
								
									 (Chevrolet)
  The full-size SUV was built for the Specialty Equipment Market Association show in Las Vegas with input from Bryan as a showcase for the Chevrolet Accessories division, and is equipped with plenty of products from the catalog along with custom parts.  
								
									 (Chevrolet)
  The truck is painted a unique Hunter Bronze color with camouflage accents that’s offset by safety orange trim pieces, including Hunting, Fishing and Everyday logos on the doors featuring antlers, fish and a sun. (Apparently, lovin’ isn’t actually encouraged in the truck.)  
								
									 (Chevrolet)
  On the functional off-roading front, the Silverado features a lifted suspension, 35-inch tires on 22-inch wheels, a larger front skid plate and a set of front tow hooks in case it still gets stuck. If it does, a cold air intake for the 5.3-liter V8 adds some oomph to get loose, while Brembo front brakes will help get it stopped before you dive into the next mud pit.  The long list of accessories includes a Thule basket roof rack with fishing rod holder, Baja Designs light bar and tubular side steps.  
								
									 (Chevrolet)
  Chevrolet also modified the truck by removing the rear windows, converting the tailgate from a hatch to a swing-out door and adding a rear-facing third row concept bench listed as a concept, so it could go on sale someday.  The truck as a whole won’t, it’ll be used as a promotional vehicle, but a determined Luke Bryan fan could build a pretty close copy (or would it be a cover?) to ride in.

                                         (Mopar)
                                    
                                  Mopar is now selling the ultimate way to resurrect your classic car.  For the first time, it’s offering the 707 hp supercharged V8 from the Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat as a crate motor that it calls (surprise, surprise) “The Hellcrate.” Up until now, a Dodge Challenger or Charger was probably sacrificed for any custom Hellcat build you’ve seen.  There’s also an engine kit with a powertrain control module, wiring harnesses, oxygen sensors, an accelerator pedal and the other equipment that allow for “plug and play” installation. The motor costs $19,530, while the engine kit goes for $2,195.  A front end accessory drive is also available.
								
									 (Mopar)
  Keep in mind, the Hellcat is the second-most powerful American motor ever made, next to the Demon version of it.  Unfortunately, the Hellcrate is only certified for use in pre-1976 vehicles due to emissions certifications, so any dreams you’ve had of building a Dodge Pacifica Hellcat will have to wait.  But, if you ever wanted a Dodge Dart that really flies or a Colt that runs like a thoroughbred, your life just got a lot easier.

                                  A former athletic trainer spoke out about the sexual harassment allegations against retired NFL quarterback Peyton Manning.  Jamie Naughright, who was an athletic trainer at Manning’s alma mater, the University of Tennessee, spoke to Inside Edition in her first television interview since the allegations began in 1996.  Jamie Naughright talked with @InsideEdition anchor @DeborahNorville. Norville joins us at the table in Studio 57: pic.twitter.com/UZIr0njwje  Naughright told the media outlet she was speaking out following the bombshell sexual misconduct allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.  "The reason why I'm here today is due to the courage and bravery that the women have come forward with the Harvey Weinstein, the survivors and the victims," Naughright told Inside Edition. "And that is really what has brought me here today to discuss that issue."  JEREMY PIVEN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT BY REALITY STAR ARIANE BELLAMAR  [Manning] “pulled his shorts down and put his anus and testicles on my face,” Naughright said on Feb. 29, 1996. The athletic trainer was examining the quarterback’s foot at the time when the alleged incident occurred.  Manning denied the allegations and insisted he was “mooning” a friend in the locker room.  The interview had an exclusive clip of Manning’s deposition, showing the then-19-year-old college quarterback telling his side of the story.  "I briefly pulled down my pants to so-called 'moon' him," Manning said in the deposition. "One second, one and a half seconds. Pulled my pants back up and continued with Jamie's examination of the bottom of my foot."  Naughright called Manning’s defense “a lie” and said she was “scared” at the time of the incident.  An ex-trainer says she received death threats in connection with sex assault claims she made against Peyton Manning. https://t.co/0VqoeaBGzB pic.twitter.com/VZ6njUmn9Y  "I was repulsed. I was scared. I was intimidated," she said. "It was definitely a predator -- intimidating, anger, violent eyes that he had."  The trainer said she filed a report with a crisis center that handled sexual assault allegations and told the counselor she "feared for her job, worried and feared for her life."  “My boss, when I called him that night, really realized that this was a serious situation," Naughright said. "This was a sexual assault and he informed me not to call the police or press."  The former athletic trainer filed an “employment complaint” against the University of Tennessee and was awarded $300,000 in a settlement before she resigned, Indy Star reported.   COREY FELDMAN DID NOT NAME HOLLYWOOD PEDOPHILES, SANTA BARBARA POLICE SAY  The incident came up again in 2001 when Manning wrote about it in his autobiography he penned with his father, Archie. Naughright sued Manning for defamation which was settled for an undisclosed amount.  Manning’s lawyer, Matthew D. McGill, released a statement to Inside Edition regarding the alleged incident.  Peyton Manning was a student at the University of Tennessee when the allegations were made.

  “Peyton Manning has been absolutely clear: Jamie Naughright’s accusations are false. When her claims were first investigated 21 years ago, she told a very different story. Her current account was invented several years later in connection with her first of several groundless litigations against Peyton. Most recently, she left Peyton’s mother a vulgar and extremely disturbing voicemail. Ms. Naughright should stop this abusive behavior.”  Naughright said in response that she has not changed her story but did not deny that she called Manning’s mother.  "I'm on Ambien. And I had sleptwalk and somehow found that number, Naughright told Inside Edition. "And anger and Ambien is not a good combination."

                                  While the rest of the world eagerly awaits the final season of HBO’s “Game of Thrones,” one of the show’s key stars will debut a new project that’s very close to his heart. The network has announced the premiere date of “Gunpowder,” starring Kit Harington.  In partnership with BBC One, HBO will debut the three-part thriller based on the events in the 17th century that led to Guy Fawkes Day. In addition to starring, Harington will co-executive produce the show. The reason the star is taking such a commanding role in this project is simple, it’s a family thing.  The star is a descendant of Robert Catesby, the central figure of the series and mastermind behind the infamously-foiled gunpowder plot. He’s also who the Jon Snow actor will be playing.  “We are delighted to offer a platform for a project that is so close to Kit harington’s heart,” Kary Antholis, president of HBO Miniseries and CINEMAX programming said in a statement. “Kit’s passion for and believe in ‘Gunpowder’ are evident in every frame of the miniseries.”  Catesby was a driving force behind the 1605 plot in London to kill James I. The series will depict a time when Catholics were persecuted by Protestant England. Catesby’s refusal to abandon his religion brings him “to the edge of financial, social and psychological ruin” as he navigates a shadow game involving spies and a government dedicated to hunting him, his family and priests down to torture and kill.  The new series will debut on December 18 and play out over the next two nights, ending on December 20.

                                  An incredible image released by NASA shows the Sun bearing a striking resemblance to a jack-o-lantern.  The image was captured on Oct. 8, 2014 by NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), which watches the Sun at all times. The orbiting space observatory was launched on Feb. 11, 2010.  'MONSTER' PLANET DISCOVERY STUNS SCIENTISTS  “Happy Halloween!” the space agency tweeted Tuesday with the stunning picture of the ‘jack-o-lantern’ sun.  Happy Halloween! This jack-o-lantern is 🔥…literally! It’s our Sun in 2014, w/ active regions on its surface https://t.co/2R2y25ZfVZ @NASASun pic.twitter.com/mBpbd8T2AA  “Active regions on the sun combined to look something like a jack-o-lantern’s face,” explained NASA, in a statement on its website. “The active regions in this image appear brighter because those are areas that emit more light and energy. They are markers of an intense and complex set of magnetic fields hovering in the sun’s atmosphere, the corona,” it added.   The image blends together two extreme sets of ultraviolet wavelengths, which are typically colorized in gold and yellow, to create an appearance resembling a jack-o-lantern, according to NASA.

Florida pizza restaurant banned children, and many are not happy  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  
                                    A pizza restaurant has made a polarizing decision to ban children from their restaurant after a scary event involving a child's safety.

                                  A Tampa Bay pizza shop posted a sign outside its business last week – no children.  The sign, written in all capital letters, quickly drew the attention, and ire, of many in the community. Soon after the new policy took place, a Tampa Bay Mom’s Group Facebook page exploded with comments about the situation.  Many felt “this is an outrage,” while others thought “it’s [the business’] prerogative.”  Troy Taylor, who opened the Hampton Station pizza shop in 2015, had started his business as a family and hipster-friendly eatery with patio courtyard and a variety of action figures positioned on the tables. But after “a lot of people who couldn’t keep their kids under control,” Taylor tells the Tampa Bay Times, he was forced to take action, referencing a particular incident as the catalyst for his decision.  NEW YORK RESTAURANT HAS ONE-DRINK LIMIT POLICY FOR CUSTOMERS WITH KIDS  "A kid was in danger and could have seriously been hurt," he said. "It’s a liability and safety issue. After the incident, I thought, this can’t happen again."  The restaurant is located on a busy street in the Seminole Heights neighborhood and has an unprotected patio with access to the road.  Troy defends his decision citing the mixture of alcohol, which the restaurant serves, and kids could have dangerous results.  Social media has been split on the Troy’s choice, with some on Facebook asking “how does this not fall into some type of discrimination?”  Another wrote, “This is a place that neighborhood families rallied around. I mean, this place literally uses action figures as their order markers.”  But many supported the no kids allowed policy, writing that there are plenty of places families can go to instead.  ITALIAN RESTAURANT REWARDS WELL-BEHAVED KIDS WITH FAMILY MEAL DISCOUNT  One Facebook user bluntly wrote, “Get over it. Go somewhere else it’s not that big of a deal lol.”  Another said, “Fine by me! I don’t have to take my kids everywhere with me and there's also plenty of other pizza places I can take them with me if I chose to.”  Some even tried to find a middle ground suggesting that maybe the pizza shop and bar “should just ban kids after a certain time” like other pubs do.  Troy said, "It’s one of the toughest things I’ve ever done. It’s been gut-wrenching. I’m not a big social media person, but I’ve stayed away from Facebook."  Troy acknowledge in a Facebook comment the Tampa Bay Mom's Group cites, that he might lose some long time customers, but he "couldn't live with the fact that a child might get hurt at Hampton."  "We had a lot of great kids come in to Hampton and we are going to miss them, but this had to be done for everyone's well being," the post says.  Courtney Mattina, a mother of two also felt the business move was a positive one.  "I’m happy to see restaurants are taking a stand and saying, ‘We don’t want kids in here being noisy or messy, we’re going to create an environment for adults only,’" she said to the Tampa Bay Times. "I was a waitress for six years and kids running around a restaurant is one of the most dangerous things in the world."

One restaurant in the same neighborhood caught flack for going child free, citing the dangers he witnessed when parents would allow children to frolic on the patio unsupervised.  While Southern Brewing and Winemaking in the same area decided not to ban children entirely, they do understand the importance of child safety. To combat bad behaviors, the brewery decided to set up a sign of rules discouraging running, screaming and other disruptive antics.  "Southern wanted to make absolutely clear that we are family-friendly and don’t want to do any blanket banning, but we need to set some ground rules,” retail associate Charlie McElman said. “We as staff said we needed signs that we can point to. I think there’s been a big shift in how people are comfortable disciplining their children, especially in public."  "It’s two camps, there’s not a lot of middle ground on [banning children]. And people go from zero to nasty when they have access to social media,” McElman added.  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC.

Manson's youngest follower tells all, claims Dennis Wilson tried to 'mold' cult leader into a rock star  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  Fox 411: Dianne Lake, now 64, chronicles her years with Charles Manson and how her life forever changed after the brutal Tate murders in 1969 in her memoir titled 'Member of the Family.'  The youngest member of America’s most infamous cult has broken her silence about the relationship she had with convicted mass murderer Charles Manson when she was just 14 years old.  Dianne Lake, now 64, has published a memoir titled “Member of the Family,” which chronicles her years with the charismatic ringleader and how her life forever changed after the brutal Tate murders in 1969.  Back before the Minneapolis native met the former convict, she was raised by hippie parents.  “I had a fairly normal upbringing until we moved to California,” Lake told Fox News. “My parents got turned on, tuned in, met up with a commune and dropped out. I didn’t fit in… five people in a bread truck was a little confining.”  "This is the bread truck that my family drove around in when we dropped out."

  In 1967, Lake met Manson all thanks to her mother, who had befriended him when he visited the house farm commune.  “She gave him a picture to look for me… But this was all unbeknownst to me,” Lake described.  His female followers, known as “the girls,” instantly recognized Lake and welcomed her with open arms.  “When I walked into this party, the girls, they all knew me,” she explained. “They went, ‘Charlie! Charlie! Dianne’s here!’ I was just totally blown away. Because I didn’t know these people. But they made me feel very welcomed.”  Charles Manson followers, from left: Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten.

  When Lake locked eyes with the 34-year-old who played guitar and sang songs, she was instantly smitten.  “He was cute, funny and very playful,” said Lake. “He was very loving, very charismatic.”  Within hours of meeting, the two had sex. Lake’s parents granted her permission to live on her own and she instantly joined “the family” that same year.   In an attempt to conceal her age, Manson gave Lake a fake ID.  Dianne Lake was previously a follower in Charles Manson's cult.

  “We took care of the babies,” said Lake. “We cooked. Went shopping in the dumpsters. Put meals together… I felt like were any other commune. We weren’t coupled off, though. There was Charlie and a few other men and we shared them.  "There were preferences, but it’s not like it was couples that came together and doing a communal living… He made each of us feel very special and there really wasn’t much jealousy because that was part of the philosophy, that there was plenty of love to go around.”  However, the free love turned violent when the man she worshipped beat and raped her in 1968, Lake said. That same year, Manson befriended Dennis Wilson of The Beach Boys. Lake believed Manson viewed the rock singer as someone who could help him spread his influence to the masses.  “Dennis really took Charlie under his wing,” said Lake. “Charlie was teaching Dennis how to play the guitar and I think he admired Charlie. He was proud to show him off to his friends. They had a good time together.”  In July 1968, Wilson scheduled a recording session for his friend. Mike Love, who was in attendance, supposedly wasn’t thrilled with the arrangement. Lake claimed when Manson didn’t get his way, he pulled a knife out. Consequently, the relationship between Manson and Wilson soured.  “They stole one of Charlie’s songs and changed the name,” she claimed. “So he wasn’t happy about that… It just wasn’t the same. I think they tried to mold him into being a rock star and Charlie wasn’t going for it. Because I think Charlie’s message was more important to him than being a rock star. He didn’t want the words to his music changed. He didn’t want to dress differently. He wasn’t happy.”  That same year, The Beatles released “The White Album.” Manson became so obsessed with the recording that he made "the family" hear it daily. He believed it was an apocalyptic sign of a race war to come, Lake said.  “It was very influential and he really felt that ‘The White Album’ was a message that confirmed what he believed, which was that there was going to be this race war that they named ‘Helter Skelter’ and he listened to it backwards,” said Lake. “And from that point on, there definitely seemed to be a stronger agenda to prepare for this.”  Manson faced another setback in spreading his destructive gospel. In spring 1969, screen star Doris Day’s son Terry Melcher, a record producer who was also friends with Wilson, was curious to hear him sing. Although Melcher arranged Manson to perform at a studio, no record deal came through, Lake revealed.  Several months later, Manson ordered some of his followers to go on a two-day murder spree, which resulted in the deaths of seven people. One of the victims was actress Sharon Tate, who was eight months pregnant with her first child with director Roman Polanski. Her home was previously occupied by Melcher.

  Lake didn’t participate in the horrific slayings.  “I disappeared for a couple of days,” she explained. “I got arrested for going through the trash and being underage. I didn’t have any ID with me at the time. And when I got back, (member) Tex [Watson] had the newspaper with the headline about the Tate murders. And he was upset, like where was I? He slapped the paper and said, ‘I did this. Charlie told me to.’”  Lake insisted she was shocked by the confession.  “I couldn’t believe it, really,” she said. “And then I was afraid to leave... Now that I know this truth, I can’t leave because he’ll come after me. And obviously he’s capable of murder. So I was very much afraid… And disappointed… [And] the girls confided in me what they had done. We had taken LSD, we were out in the middle of the desert and they just started sharing.”  Charles Manson

  Looking back, Lake doesn’t believe Tate was specifically targeted.  “The only connection I know of was that Terry Melcher had lived in that house and both Charlie and Tex had been there because Terry was going to help us record an album,” she explained. “…I don’t know if it was revenge or just because of the whole race war thing… or they were trying to create mayhem on a bigger scale… I can’t answer that. I only know the correlation. I only know what was going on at that time, at least from what I can remember at this time.”  In 1970, Lake found herself facing Manson once again in an L.A. courtroom where she testified against him and some of his followers. He was found guilty of first-degree murder and is currently serving a life sentence.  Dianne Lake would go on to have a normal life after Charles Manson.

  Lake’s life would change once again when she was taken in as a foster child by arresting officer Jack Gardiner and his wife Carol.  “They really made me feel like there was something worth saving,” she recalled. “I came out of the darkness and into the light.”  Lake has been a member of a local church for 30 years where she sings in the choir. She later married, raised three children and is currently a retired special education teacher.  Dianne Lake today.

                                  A man and a woman flew into some trouble Sunday night after they were reportedly caught engaging in a sexual act on a Delta flight from Los Angeles to Detroit.  The man, 28, and woman, 48, were not named, but both were issued citations, and the FBI is currently investigating the incident, according to Detoit's WDIV-TV.  The woman was caught giving the man oral sex while the two were in their seats, the station further reported.  PASSENGERS ‘HELD AGAINST THEIR WILL’ AT AIRPORT BECAUSE OFFICERS WERE LATE  Both the man and woman were traveling to Detroit to catch separate connecting flights: He was going on to Miami, and she to Nashville. The two were reportedly strangers before meeting on the plane, officials told WDIV.  "The act itself is inappropriate in a public space," one traveler told the station.  "There are children," said another. "There are families. There are seniors. These things should be respected."  AIRLINE PASSENGERS WANT 'HAMILTON' TICKETS AS COMPENSATION FOR DELAY  The FBI said the investigation was underway and the two might be charged with a misdemeanor, or even a felony. The bureau said the charges could be issued as soon as Tuesday.  Delta Airlines has declined to comment on the incident.

Jenny McCarthy says Hugh Hefner was horrified by her Playboy audition  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  In the Zone: Jenny McCarthy talks strong women, Playboy, posing nude today, vaccine controversies and Jim Carrey's ex-girlfriend's suicide  Jenny McCarthy got candid about her near-disastrous audition for Playboy at age 22.  “When I was trying out to be a centerfold, they actually gave the girls five days of a test,” the 44-year-old model and actress recalled on “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” Sunday.  However, Playboy founder Hugh Hefner wasn’t impressed by McCarthy’s look.  “So eight hours a day for five days, on day four, the producer said, ‘Come meet with me, Hef is on the phone’,” she explained. “And Hef said, ‘You’ve got one more chance. Go home and practice, because your face looks like you just hit a deer with your car. You look so horrified’.”  McCarthy continued, “So I went home that night trying to find sexy, and I came back and go, ‘OK, listen, all you’re going to get is a smile. That’s all I know how to do’.”  McCarthy’s megawatt smile landed her the deal of a lifetime – she was selected out of thousands of applicants for Playboy’s October 1993 issue. She went on to receive the coveted title of “Playmate of the Year.”  Hefner died in late September at age 91.   RIP #Hef  Thank you for being a revolutionary and changing so many people's lives, especially mine. Thank you for choosing me to be one of your bunnies. I hope I made you proud. I will forever be grateful. 🙏🏻😓❤️  A post shared by Jenny McCarthy (@jennymccarthy) on Sep 27, 2017 at 8:30pm PDT  McCarthy never forgot about the opportunity Hefner gave her to make it big. She previously spoke about her relationship with Hefner on her self-titled SiriusXM radio show, calling him “the most good-hearted, caring, generous, supportive friend and mentor.”  “He’d always say, ‘Thanks for sharing the dream, Jen’,” she said at the time while holding back tears. “And when I thought about him passing last night, I just thought, I wanted one more chance to say thanks. Thank you for sharing your dream with me and for giving so many girls and so many people the opportunity of a lifetime.”  She added, “I will always miss you Hef. You will never be forgotten.”  A post shared by Jenny McCarthy (@jennymccarthy) on Oct 12, 2017 at 12:23pm PDT  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC.

'Duck Dynasty' star claims her family was targeted by white supremacists over biracial son  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.

                                  Former “Duck Dynasty” star, Korie Robertson, has become an outspoken voice for racial healing in the United States, and now claims that she and her family were targeted by white supremacists over their adopted biracial son.  The star first made a name for herself on the topic of race relations after an emotional interview with CNN in which she called for Donald Trump to call out white supremacists in the wake of the Charlottesville protests. The star furthered this narrative while speaking to CBN News where she revealed that, as her family’s star rose, so too did the danger from racism.  “We have to stand up, and we should be emotional about things like that and we have to stand up and talk about it,” she said. “When our family hit mainstream and all the sudden all of America’s watching, they noticed our son’s biracial and we got comments and we got hate and negativity and we were actually targeted by white supremacists at one point. So it’s just shocking and scary and sad to know that that still exists in our country.”  A post shared by Korie Robertson (@bosshogswife) on May 15, 2017 at 4:26pm PDT  The star went on to explain that she believes people need to constantly be talking about race and acknowledge the large population that believes someone is better than someone else based on the color of their skin. Additionally, she called on the church to lead the charge toward unity.  “I think we need to speak up, and we need to talk about it. Sometimes we kind of just don't talk about it because maybe in some ways we don't know what to say. We don't want to make a mistake. We want to be politically correct, so we just stay silent and hope that it gets better, and that's really not the way to healing,"  Korie and her husband, Willie Robertson, adopted their son Will when he was just five weeks old. They’ve become proponents of adoption and previously told People that their son being biracial hasn’t come up in the way they raise him, only in how the public looks at them.  “Here’s the thing: when we look at him, we don’t see an adopted kid. It doesn’t even cross our minds,” Willie told the outlet. “He’s as much ours as our biological children.”  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC.

                                  Violinist Lindsey Stirling is one of the favorites to win the mirror ball trophy on "Dancing with the Stars" this season — but in a sour note, she's suffered a serious rib injury.  On Monday night's show, viewers saw Stirling reveal how she displaced a rib during last week's dress rehearsal.  She and partner Mark Ballas got through their sci-fi-themed dance for movie night, but this Sunday she appeared to aggravate the injury and moaned to him, "It hurts! I can't even rehearse because I'm in so much pain."  Ballas took her to urgent care, where Stirling nervously asked him what would happen if she couldn't dance. The longtime "DWTS" pro said that would mean they would forfeit and have to leave the competition.  However, Stirling was cleared to dance and delivered a fast-paced Paso Doble based on the Day of the Dead, in which she had to slide across the floor on her knees.  Ballas and host Tom Bergeron had to help her up off the floor at the end of the dance as she appeared to collapse. Stirling crouched on her partner's knee and complained again of pain before getting the judges' critiques.  Carrie Ann Inaba praised her bravery and Bruno Tonioli marveled, "You managed to do it!"  Stirling wasn't able to complete post-show interviews but Ballas told reporters afterwards, "She's doing better. I told her she needed to go put ice on [her rib].  "We took the X-ray yesterday and I was nervous…because if it was a break or a fracture that would have been a huge problem. There's no break, no fracture, so they call it a floating rib. I can't give you the professional diagnosis of what that is…I know that the muscles between the ribs are really painful.  "Luckily, she's in a state where she can continue [on "DWTS"] as of now," he said.  Ballas noted that it seemed like a freak injury: "It's funny. You always seem to hurt yourself doing dumb s--t….I think she [just] lifted her arm and it went, bup!"  The dancer emphasized, "Her health comes first. I'm nervous about her being OK. Thank God it looks like she'll be able to continue."  Ballas is making sure Stirling, who has thrilled YouTube viewers with her violin, gets enough rest and that she's "chilling."   This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC.

Powerful tiny tanks with VR and futuristic cockpits could revolutionize the battlefield  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  Fox Firepower: Allison Barrie with an early look at the future of armored warfare: windowless tanks that utilize virtual and augmented reality to allow soldiers to see the battlefield.  Future U.S. military tanks may look and perform nothing like they do today.  In fact, they may not even have windows and instead seal military personnel inside a closed cockpit to better protect them against threats.  But how could they see the battlefield around them without windows? To see outside, Soldiers could use a new technology made by Honeywell that lets them “see” with virtual reality and augmented reality.  Using a headset and a wraparound display, drivers are given the effect of “seeing” beyond the armor to the war zone around them. The augmented reality even enhances their “sight” by overlaying crucial information like enemy movements and safe routes ahead.  This remarkable advance is part of the DARPA’s Ground X-Vehicle Technology program (GXV-T) initiative that could lead to an entirely new era of tanks and armored combat vehicles. GXV-T would offer tank-like protection on a vehicle that resembles a futuristic All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) but is smaller than a traditional tank.  SLIME OF 300-MILLION-YEAR-OLD CREATURE MAY BE USED FOR BODY ARMOR  DARPA awarded eight contracts to work on the exciting, groundbreaking GXV-T. Honeywell is one of these companies.  Recently, Honeywell successfully tested this window-free tech on a tough, off-road desert course at speeds of more than 35mph. The drivers successfully maneuvered the course from inside the closed cockpit relying on the “sight” provided by the virtual reality system.  Unsurprisingly, the U.S. Army and Marine Corps are already interested in DARPA’s vision for this radical new vehicle. The GXV-T would provide the U.S. military with enormous advantages over adversaries.    Far Better Armor  The big advantage to no windows? Keep US military personnel inside a whole lot safer.  Another research thrust for DARPA on the GXV-T project is radically overhauling the approach to armor. For more than a century, the approach has been more armor equals more protection.  WILL COMBAT VEHICLES USE URINE FOR FUEL?  There are, however, tradeoffs to more armor, such as adding more weight, which means less speed and agility. These capabilities can be essential in some scenarios so finding the right balance between the armor trade-offs is never easy.  But with GXV-T, the goal is a closed cockpit that allows reactive armor to enhance safety on the outside. Reactive armor detects threats and reacts. So, for example, when it anticipates the impact of a threat like an RPG, this armor would be able to shift and concentrate in the area it will impact.  Without the windows, it may be possible to do far more with less armor and still offer far better protection.  PODCAST: VAMPIRE BATS V. NAVY SEALS. INSIDE JUNGLE WARFARE WITH SEAL TEAM 6    How does it work?  Honeywell harnessed its experience with aircraft cockpits and applied it to creating a GXV-T “cockpit.”  Cameras and sensors fixed on the vehicle feed data to onboard computers. These stitch together the data into one cohesive image and the wraparound internal screens display this imagery.    WILL A SINGLE BOMB STOP NORTH KOREA?  The operator dons the special virtual and augmented reality headset and when that is combined with the panoramic screen it creates the effect of “seeing” outside the vehicle – whilst safely inside a closed cockpit.  Already, Honeywell’s virtual landscape allows an operator to off-road at realistic speeds. This set of initial tests were conducted with 160-degree views. DARPA’s aim is for a 360-degree view and although it may seem impossible, it may be possible to achieve that.  Motion sickness and eye strain are two common complaints and tough challenges for companies working to advance virtual reality. Honeywell seems to have cracked these pesky problems because the feedback thus far has been very positive with drivers not suffering from either complaint.  Augmented Reality View  Safety and protection is paramount, but another key advantage to this revolutionary approach is providing operators with enhanced “sight.” With augmented reality, operators can have crucial data overlaid as well.  Already, Honeywell has been able to build in speed, heading, and position data augmentation. But lots of further symbols could be added to further assist driver’s during their missions.  AUSA 2017: 4 AMAZING LAND VEHICLES AT THIS YEAR’S SHOW  Enemy movements, the best routes to avoid detection, upcoming difficult terrain, threat detection – these are just a few examples of useful data that could augment what a driver “sees.” Enhanced situational awareness will also improve safety for personnel.  In many ways, this is very similar to the data displayed in U.S. fighter pilots’ cockpits, but would now be available to ground forces in closed cockpits.  PODCAST: LEARN HOW TO FLY A FIGHTER JET WITH A FASCINATING FIGHTER PILOT   What is GXV-T?  DARPA’s Ground X-Vehicle Technology program (GXV-T) is advancing tech for combat in many ways. Overall, the goal is to produce smarter, faster and more agile vehicles for the future force.  Another area that will increase protection, for example, is the progress being made to develop the GXV-T as ultra-stealthy.  ATHENA LASER WEAPON 'KILLS' 5 'OUTLAWS'  Tanks are not exactly known for being stealthy. But imagine if the military could have a vehicle with tank protection, but fighter jet stealth? Advances are being made in tech for the GXV-T to evade detection by the enemy from acoustic and electromagnetic methods through to infrared.  A new kind of driving  For the military, these kinds of big breakthroughs could pave the way to the future force taking tanks into battle that have remarkable advantages like this virtual and augmented reality and futuristic reactive armor. This would turn them into much lighter and far more agile vehicles, while providing even more protection for U.S. troops.  But there is also potential for significant impact in the civilian world. Honeywell’s achievement could help pave the way to a future where civilians take advantage of the enhanced safety closed cockpits could offer and drive windowless as well. Or windshields could become transformed into displays that offer augmented reality, suggesting optimal routes to avoid traffic so drivers will never have to look down at their phones for Waze again.

US Army eyes new lightweight hot weather uniform, jungle boots  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  
                                    Soldiers with the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii tackle obstacles in February 2017, while evaluating a new, lighter weight uniform. (U.S. Army photo )
                                    
                                  The U.S. Army is developing a lightweight hot weather alternative to the current Army Combat Uniform (ACU) and new jungle boots.  The current ACU weighs about 1.4 pounds and has lots of pockets and multiple layers of fabric. This means that “when it gets wet, it tends to stay wet,” the Army explained in a statement released this week. “And when it's hot out, it tends to keep soldiers hot,” it added.  The answer is the Improved Hot Weather Army Combat Uniform, which has fewer pockets, layers of fabric and Velcro, the Army said. The new uniform also uses a lighter fabric.  THE EVOLUTION OF US MILITARY CAMOUFLAGE: FROM BASIC GREEN AND KHAKI TO DIGITAL PATTERNS AND BEYOND  "You can hold that uniform up with one finger," said Brig. Gen. Brian P. Cummings, Program Executive Officer (PEO) Soldier, out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, in the statement.  While the current ACU has had a lot of positive feedback, Cummings noted that the likes of shoulder pockets, pen pockets, leg pockets and Velcro swatches for patches require multiple layers of fabric, fastening material and buttons. All of these features hold water “and cost money,” he added.  The jacket from the Improved Hot Weather Army Combat Uniform is on display at PEO Soldier.  HISTORY OF CAMOUFLAGE IN PICTURES  U.S. soldiers in jungle environments will be the first to get their hands on the lightweight uniform, specifically the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii. Cummings said that the Army eventually wants to make the uniform available to all soldiers.  The Army hopes that the new uniform will be available within a year. Cummings explained, however, that the new uniform’s fabric may prove more susceptible to wrinkling after washing. This could be fixed with the application of an anti-wrinkling treatment, although that would depend on whether the treatment interfered with the uniform’s ability to wick away water.   The new uniform’s flame-resistant capability also needs to be considered, according to Cummings.  In addition to the new uniform, the Army is also working on a new jungle boot. Last month, soldiers in the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii received 30,000 pairs of the new design to evaluate.  EVOLUTION OF COMBAT BOOTS: FROM BOOTEES TO MODERN TACTICAL BOOTS  Feedback on the boots has been positive, but Cummings said that soldiers want a boot that is lighter and softer. They have also requested thinner soles.  The next set of samples, Cummings said, will be "a lot more pliable. And able to serve the soldier well. But instead of lasting five years, they [will] last two years."  The newer boots will also go through evaluation with soldiers and share features with the boots currently being tested. These capabilities include puncture resistance, more drainage holes, the ability to wick away water, the ability to push water and mud off the soles, speed laces and lower profile heels so as not to catch on vines on the jungle floor, according to the Army’s statement.  HISTORY OF COMBAT BOOTS IN PICTURES  Last year, the U.S. Navy announced that it is getting rid of its blue camouflage ‘blueberries’ uniform.     This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC.

But on Monday night's show, he and partner Emma Slater took a hard tumble onto the ballroom floor!  Scott and Slater performed a difficult Charleston routine for the Halloween-themed night and toward the end of the dance, the two suddenly appeared to slip — and both fell down. But during the spooky Halloween show anything is possible, so some thought it could be part of the routine.  Afterward, co-host Erin Andrews spilled the beans, laughing, "Let's be honest. There was a bit of a fall, right?"  Slater explained that for their dance, based on the movie "Corpse Bride," "there's a lot of fog on the floor and it kind of leaves this residue … but you know what? He did it right on!  "We knew the floor was quite slippery," she said.  For his part, Scott said, "I think with something like this, we can get away with a bit of goofiness. I got back on my feet and we finished that thing off."  "It was artistic creativeness," his partner added with tongue in cheek.   Judge Carrie Ann Inaba told Andrews, she thought "it was part of the choreography. I thought it was really clever."  Scott and Slater earned 27 out of 30 points for the dance, with Inaba saying, "I love the energy."  The couple also received a perfect score of 30 for their team dance based on "The Phantom of the Opera," in which they were team captains.  The 6'4" star Scott, who appears with twin brother Jonathan on HGTV's "Property Brothers," has stood tall on "DWTS" while juggling filming for both shows. He's also planning his wedding to fiancé Linda Phan.  Vanessa Lachey and Nikki Bella were eliminated on Monday night, so Scott will compete against Victoria Arlen, Terrell Owens, Frankie Muniz, Jordan Fisher and Lindsey Stirling next week — when the house expert will hopefully have a stronger foundation!

                                  Ford sells an F-Series pickup now that costs $100,000, but it’s got nothing on this.  The Hennessey VelociRaptor 6x6 is a custom Ford F-150 Raptor with six-wheels and a six figure price tag of $295,000 to go with them.  
								
									 (Hennessey Performance)
  The truck is making its public debut at the SEMA show in Las Vegas, if they can fit it in the building.  (JK, but it is big.)  Along with the extended bed, the super truck gets a second Raptor rear axle that gives it six-wheel-drive, modified Fox suspension, 20-inch wheels, and unique front and rear bumpers.  
								
									 (Hennessey Performance)
  If you don’t think the Raptor’s 450 hp twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 can handle it, Hennessey also offers an engine and exhaust upgrade that bumps it up to over 600 horsepower for $22,500.  (That’s not cheap, but it is less than 8 percent the price of the rest of the truck, so there’s that.)  The power kit is also available on the 4x4 Raptor if you want to save a couple of hundred grand, but the 6x6 is several times cooler.

Trump's Labor Department aims to make tip-pooling legal again  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.

                                  The Trump administration is planning to revoke a rule that banned tip-pooling for restaurants.  The Obama-era rule prohibited restaurants from taking servers’ tips, combining them and then redistributing them as the owner or manager sees fit.  The Trump administration has been saying they plan to repeal the ban for months, but has recently taken the steps to do so.  The pending rule change would only “rescind the current restrictions on tip pooling by employers that pay tipped employees the full minimum wage directly.” Meaning restaurants that pay servers the full $7.25 minimum wage, instead of the $2.13 tipped wage, can pool tips.  KENDALL JENNER CALLED OUT FOR NOT TIPPING AT NEW YORK BAR  The law Obama’s administration created ruled that employees own their tips, not the restaurant, and that restaurants are not allowed to pool tips or give them to non-tipped employees. The rules applied to all levels of wage-earning servers.  Activists are concerned that the removal of the ban will lead to owners taking the tips for themselves, which could be possible under the proposed law change.  The co-founder of ROC United, one of the groups fighting for a $15 wage, said, “It says it’s possible for employers to walk away with the tips and not give them to anybody.”  The National Restaurant Association lobby told CBS that removing the restrictions on tip pooling alleviates the “disparity between the ‘front of the house’ and the ‘back of the house,’” since the back of the house employees are not tipped.  FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS  The Oregon Restaurant & Lodging Association welcomes the rule change as well, stating it would protect “our members from private lawsuits for the period the rule was purportedly in place.”  Federal courts have disagreed over if the changes were okay, meaning the issue could be escalated to the Supreme Court unless Trump’s administration intervenes with a federal ruling beforehand.

Rose McGowan facing arrest warrant for alleged drug possession  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  Meryl Streep, Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd and Mark Ruffalo are but a few celebrities speaking out against Harvey Weinstein in the wake of his firing due to allegations of sexual assault.  An arrest warrant was issued Monday for actress Rose McGowan for alleged felony possession of a controlled substance on a flight earlier this year, police said.  McGowan, who has been one of the leading voices against sexual harassment in Hollywood, faces a felony charge after police said an investigation revealed that her personal belongings left behind on a United flight back in January tested positive for narcotics.     The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Police Department obtained the warrant on Feb. 1.  McGowan claimed Monday in a tweet that the warrant was an attempt to “silence” her.  Police said they've attempted to contact McGowan so she can appear in a Loudoun County, Virginia, court. The warrant has been entered into a national law enforcement database.  McGowan tweeted earlier this month that she was raped by a man with the initials "HW." The Hollywood Reporter said McGowan confirmed she was referring to disgraced media mogul Harvey Weinstein.

A strawberry-topped pizza is the newest target of the Internet's ire  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  
                                    Despite backlash over the strange dish, strawberry pizza is apparently popular enough to be the subject of stock photography.

                                  It feels like only yesterday that the world was divided over the notion of putting pineapple on a pizza — the president of Iceland even said he’d like to make it illegal — but a new pizza topping has since emerged for the Internet to endlessly and angrily argue about: strawberries.  PIZZERIA SENDS CUSTOMER A FUNNY NOTE AFTER REFUSING TO PUT PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA  Earlier this week, a Twitter user named MoonEmoji ignited a heated debate after posting a photo of a cheese pizza topped with sliced strawberries. In the caption, MoonEmoji also referenced the infamous pineapple debate from earlier this year, writing “strawberries>>pineapple.”  strawberries>>pineapples pic.twitter.com/VfTJQ2WjhF  Comments started pouring in from both supporters and detractors of MoonEmoji’s meal choice, though the majority was clearly in the latter camp.

Pineapple and non-pineapple pizza eaters must put our differences aside and join forces to defeat this evil https://t.co/WE59N20UJ5  LebaenesePapi’s post apparently resonated with the Twitterverse, who retweeted his call to action more than 156,000 times as of Tuesday morning.

STRAWBERRIES ON PIZZA IS GOOD! LEAVE ME ALONEEE pic.twitter.com/i154rrUUAd  Stop reporting me to the @FBI IM LEGITIMATELY SCARED  As of press time, however, MoonEmoji has not disclosed where he/she ordered the offending pizza.

Finnair will weigh its airline passengers as part of voluntary pilot program  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  
                                    Extra baggage takes on a whole new meaning.

                                  Jetsetters may find a new incentive to pack light, as another airport will begin weighing passengers as of Oct. 31.  Travelers on Finnair flights departing Helsinki-Vantaa Airport can elect to step on a scale with their carry-on luggage as part of a voluntary pilot program, YLE News reports.   Through November, Finnair hopes at least 150 ticket holders and their luggage will voluntarily step on the scale to provide the airline with more accurate data for calculating the weight and balance of their planes. Currently, Finnair is working with data from the European Aviation Safety Agency from 2009.  STRANGERS ON DELTA FLIGHT PERFORMED SEX ACT IN THEIR SEATS, OFFICIALS SAY  "Loads are different in the summer, for example, when people don't have their winter jackets and shoes and other paraphernalia. There is also a considerable seasonal difference in hand luggage weight for business and leisure travelers," Paivyt Tallqvist, media relations director for the airline, told YLE.  In addition to weighing the passengers, Finnair will record statistics on the age, gender, travel purpose, passenger class and checked bags of the customers who participate. This information will all be logged anonymously, Tallqvist added.  PASSENGERS 'HELD AGAINST THEIR WILL' AT AIRPORT BECAUSE OFFICERS WERE LATE  Nevertheless, Finnair passengers departing Helinski won’t be the first-ever air travelers to step on the scale before boarding.  In 2016, Pago Pago International Airport in American Samoa came under fire for weighing passengers before boarding and assigning seats to maximize aircraft balance. Many Samoans felt the policy to be particularly offensive and discriminatory, as the islands have some of the highest rates of obesity and Type 2 diabetes in the world, according to NPR.  Likewise, in 2015, Uzbekistan Airways introduced similar pre-boarding weigh-ins to increase safety in the high skies.

Bottles filled with urine found in walls of luxury condo  This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.  
                                    A contractor found the urine and other assorted "garbage" in the walls of the luxury 1200 Avenue at Port Imperial building, court documents say.

                                  A couple in Weehawken, N.J., made a surprising discovery upon renovating their new $2 million condo in March: the walls had been stuffed with bottles of urine.  “I’ve never ever really seen anything like this before,” said Derrick S., the contractor who was hired by the couple to renovate the property, in an interview with The New York Post. “There were urine bottles falling out of the ceiling. As we moved some of the insulation, there were bottles of urine in it that fell out.”  THE OBAMAS' POTENTIAL NYC HOME WAS SITE OF TWO TRAGIC SUICIDES  The new homeowners, who wished to remain nameless, are now suing the Lennar construction company for fraud and breach of warranty. They’re also seeking punitive and compensatory damages, as well as any court costs they incur, per the Post.  In addition to bottles of urine, court documents say the couple found “containers containing remnants of partially eaten food, construction debris and other garbage” within the walls of their new residence at the luxury 1200 Avenue at Port Imperial building, including partially eaten Chinese food orders and cupcake wrappers. The insulation in the master bedroom was also found to be soaked in urine.  “To my knowledge that’s all very bad for your health,” said Derrick S. “There were a lot of things I saw that [weren’t] up to code.”  TINY-HOUSE DEVELOPMENT CAUSING BIG PROBLEM IN NORTH CAROLINA  According to the lawsuit, Lennar was “embarrassed” by the couple’s findings, though they had not planned to open up all of the unit’s ceilings and walls for inspection. (Lennar is only opening up the lower parts of certain walls, the Post reports.) The couple also tried to sell the home back to Lennar, but their offer was rejected.  “Lennar seems to think it can get away with business as usual — by advertising luxury — while selling garbage — in Hudson County,” said the couple’s lawyer, Phil Chronakis. “I’m going to have a Hudson County jury look at what Lennar did — those jurors will be outraged as should all of us.”  FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS  According to Lennar's website, units in the Avenue residential complexes range from $1,399,000 to $3,750,000. The company also advertises its well-appointed kitchens, “spa-like” bathrooms and views of the nearby New York City skyline.
