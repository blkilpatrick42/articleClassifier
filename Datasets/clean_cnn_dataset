"the law says give us 30 days' notice. president thought unconstitutional invalid law, shouldn't signed bill," said georgia's saxby chambliss, top republican senate intelligence committee. "he knew well required law give us 30 days' notice didn't it." obama told reporters poland tuesday circumstances required immediate decision within authority commander chief. "we saw opportunity" "we consulted congress quite time possibility may execute prisoner exchange," obama said past talks involving bergdahl. "we saw opportunity concerned health cooperation qataris seized that. truncated make sure didn't miss opportunity." issue touches flashpoints old new administration critics, especially conservative republicans seeking depict obama weak leader driven political concerns legacy. foremost whether obama administration actually broke law telling congress beforehand weekend exchange bergdahl got handed u.s. military commandos near afghanistan-pakistan border five alleged senior terrorism figures flown qatar. national defense authorization act signed law obama late last year, administration gained added flexibility transferring detainees guantanamo bay, required notify congress 30 days advance. however, legislators power block transfer. writing law last year, benjamin wittes brookings institution said put administration "in position move detainees guantanamo long willing politically accountable problems create long don't bring united states." "it lawful," white house says exactly happened, national security council spokeswoman caitlin hayden argued tuesday statement. "given credible reports regarding risk grave harm sergeant bergdahl rapidly unfolding events surrounding recovery, lawful administration proceed transfer notwithstanding notice requirement" ndaa, hayden said statement. cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin disagreed, saying obama "clearly broke law" even provide legal justification did. bottom line, toobin, law calls 30 days' notice obama didn't it. law, defense secretary chuck hagel authorize transfer "determines actions taken substantially mitigate risk individual engage activity threatens united states u.s. persons interests," transfer "is national security interest united states," hayden said. poland, obama noted tuesday qatar provided assurances would monitor activities five guantanamo detainees, described senior terrorist figures. terms exchange, five released taliban figures can't leave qatar year.

"we don't condition that, that's every mom dad sees son daughter sent war theater expect commander chief united states america." 30-day notification period congress, hayden said obama administration determined wait could scuttle swap perhaps cost bergdahl life. conflicting responsibilities provided legal explanation, saying constitution requires obama president commander chief protect lives americans abroad protect u.s. soldiers, responsibilities case conflicted 30-day notification period congress. "we believe fair conclude congress intend administration would barred taking action circumstances," wrote. hayden also noted signing ndaa, obama said law "in certain circumstances would violate constitutional separation powers principles." "the executive branch must flexibility, among things, act swiftly conducting negotiations foreign countries regarding circumstances detainee transfers," hayden quoted obama's signing statement. toobin said signing statement amounts president's opinion "of law mean," rather legal ruling. "this example signing statement president taking power law didn't give him," toobin said. "that may constitutional, still violation law says." congress, exchange irritated already raw nerve never-ending power struggle white house legislators, accuse every administration trying run roughshod congressional authority. even obama ally like democratic sen. dianne feinstein california told cnn chair senate intelligence committee, received advance notice swap involving guantanamo detainees. tuesday, feinstein told reporters white house deputy national security adviser, tony blinken, called apologize lack advance notice. however, unclear feinstein's comments blinken referred courtesy call 30-day notification law. meanwhile, feinstein house speaker john boehner said white house encountered opposition top democrats republicans congressional intelligence committees previously discussed possibility exchanging bergdahl guantanamo detainees far back 2011. "given past briefings concerns addressed -- committees leadership committees; concerns bipartisan -- strongly believe consulted, law followed much regret case," feinstein said. boehner, ohio republican, also argued past discussions meant legislators expected obama administration brief exchange took place, adding: "the reason administration knew faced serious sober bipartisan concern opposition." however, another veteran democrat said administration took proper steps circumstances. "we received detailed classified notification secretary defense satisfies many substantive certification requirements national defense authorization act," said statement sen. carl levin michigan, chairs senate armed services committee. noting obama "put congress notice" last december intended act quickly cases, "members congress surprised acted circumstances existed." gop attack strategy republicans piled part strategy tarnish obama democratic brands ahead november's congressional elections 2016 presidential vote. gop committee chairmen house already plan hearings legality swap, move backed boehner. chambliss, retiring current term expires end year, challenged administration's explanation berhdahl's ill health necessitated moving swiftly complete weekend exchange. "there indication president said don't believe thing president says now," said. veteran gop sen. john mccain arizona took broader aim tuesday, telling fox news bergdahl swap part called misguided policy get american troops afghanistan end 2016 -- timetable obama announced last week. "the president may ending war afghanistan, taliban al qaeda ending war afghanistan," said mccain, constant critic effort obama limit u.s. military presence abroad. obama, defeated mccain 2008 presidential election, "is carrying foreign policy unreliability weakness" cost nation "for years come," said senator, former prisoner war. toobin said expected controversy remain political arena, noting courts rarely ever get involved power squabble executive legislative branches.
