hay muchos líderes en el siglo xxi que hayan vivido en una cueva trabajado como agricultores antes de afianzarse en el poder en una de las naciones más poderosas del mundo hace cinco décadas cuando el caos de la revolución cultural envolvió pekín xi jinping que entonces tenía 15 años se embarcó en la dura vida rural del interior de china la región donde xi trabajaba como agricultor había sido un bastión de los comunistas durante la guerra civil era yan'an que se hacía llamar la tierra santa de la revolución china ahora cuando va confirmarse el segundo período en el poder de xi jinping en el congreso del partido comunista el presidente está mando de una superpotencia creciente confiada pero es una nación que vigila celosamente lo que se dice de sus líderes la propia historia de xi ha sido limpiada el pueblo donde creció ahora se ha convertido en un destino de peregrinaje de los más leales partido comunista en 1968 mao decretó que millones de jóvenes se mudaran de las ciudades hacia el campo para aprender de la dura vida de los campesinos xi asegura que sí aprendió que las ideas las cualidades que lo definen hoy se formaron en ese período de su vida cuando vivió en una cueva en liangjiahe cuando llegué los 15 años estaba ansioso confundido cuando partí los 22 tenía firmes objetivos en mi vida estaba lleno de confianza declaró en esa época todos estudiaban el famoso libro rojo del presidente mao ahora los pensamientos del presidente xi se colocan en enormes carteleras publicitarias hay un museo en su honor en éste se alaban las buenas obras que hizo por sus compañeros campesinos pero todos los rasgos de su verdadera personalidad han sido eliminados de su historia que es tan perfecta que es difícil distinguir qué es real en sus primeros 5 años en el poder xi jinping ha construido un culto su personalidad en el centro está la imagen de un hombre del pueblo que habla sin pretensiones que ha hecho fila en una tienda humilde para comprar pan pagado por su comida pero el núcleo del mito que se ha creado alrededor de xi es su vida exiliado de su familia hogar cuando vivió como marginado político en una cueva durante su infancia su padre fue un héroe de la revolución comunista xi gozó de la vida privilegiada protegida de los principitos comunistas un cable de un diplomático estadounidense publicado por wikileaks en 2009 basado en una discusión con un amigo cercano de xi afirma que los primeros 10 años de su vida fueron los más formativos las influencias más permanentes que formaron las opiniones de xi fueron su pedigrí como 'principito la época cuando creció en los recintos residenciales de las familias de la primera generación de revolucionarios del partido comunista en pekín dice pero todo esto se derrumbó en la vorágine que impuso contra la élite del partido un presidente mao cada vez más paranoico vengativo durante los 1960. el padre de xi primero fue purgado luego encarcelado su familia humillada una de sus hermanas murió quizás en un suicidio para cuando cumplió 13 años la educación formal de xi llegó su fin ya que las clases en pekín fueron suspendidas para que los estudiantes pudieran criticar golpear e incluso asesinar sus maestros así comenzó la segunda etapa de la vida del adolescente xi en pekín sin padres ni amigos que lo protegieran de las amenazas detenciones de los guardias rojos que se encargaban de administrar la justicia de la revolución cultural en las calles muchos de la generación de xi están de acuerdo en que cuando terminó su educación en el colegio aprendieron sobrevivir con el sentido común la dureza emocional la independencia de pensamiento xi recordaría después su capacidad para escuchar otros puntos de vista sin tener necesariamente que doblegarse ellos aprendí disfrutar cuando se indicaban mis errores pero dejarme influir por ello sólo porque fulano sultano decía algo yo iba empezar analizar cada uno de los costos beneficios iba perder el sueño por ello la vida rural en la china de los 1960 era muy dura había electricidad ni transporte motorizado ni herramientas mecánicas el adolescente xi aprendió transportar estiércol construir presas reparar carreteras compartió la cama infestada de pulgas en su cueva con otros tres jóvenes uno de ellos era el agricultor lu housheng quien dijo en 2015 todo lo que teníamos para comer en esa época era avena hierbas bollos cocidos vapor cuando tienes tienes hambre te importa lo que comes en la noche contó lu xi se retiraba su cueva para leer luz de una lámpara de queroseno lo recuerda como un lector voraz fumador empedernido según lu xi tenía sentido del humor jugaba póker ni se entretenía con otros jóvenes ni buscaba novia los 18 se sintió preparado para embarcarse en su carrera política se unió la liga de la juventud comunista los 21 pesar de múltiples rechazos debido encarcelamiento de su padre su familia caída en desgracia finalmente logró unirse partido extremadamente pragmático realista con 'los ojos puestos en el premio desde joven así es como lo describe un amigo en el cable diplomático de 2009. diferencia de muchos jóvenes que recuperaron el tiempo perdido divirtiéndose xi era excepcionalmente ambicioso enfocado después de la revolución cultural eligió sobrevivir convirtiéndose en más rojo que los rojos cuando cumplió 25 años su padre ya había sido rehabilitado políticamente enviado dirigir guangdong la vasta provincia vecina de hong kong que se convertiría en el motor del ascenso económico de china el padre de xi impulsó la carrera de su hijo con su red de patrocinadores según su amigo xi rápidamente aprendió construir su propia red cuidadosamente estableció un plan profesional para aprovechar máximo sus oportunidades para llegar los niveles más altos de la jerarquía del partido agregó primero fue convirtiéndose en oficial del ejército fines de los 1970 después trabajando en una variedad de cargos del liderazgo provincial progresivamente ascendiendo de rango en su mente tenía la promoción ... desde el primer día xi se llevó consigo los traumas de su niñez la soledad de la cueva según su amigo su reserva la distancia que mantenía contribuyeron fracaso de su primer matrimonio con la hija de un alto diplomático la única vez que se vio siendo el centro de atención fue cuando se casó con su actual esposa una famosa cantante durante muchos años el público bromeaba ¿quién es xi jinping ? es el esposo de peng liyuan después de haber visto cómo su padre era acosado por mao xi hizo concesiones poder se mostró muy cuidadoso para evitar hacer enemigos incluso ya entrado en sus 40 50 años siendo un alto líder del partido siempre se mostró competente nunca llamativo los tenía todos absortos cuando se convirtió en líder del partido comunista en 2012 xi había sido el candidato de consenso pocos dentro fuera de china adivinaron lo que vendría después 5 años de choque asombro político el 11 de junio de 2015 un hombre de pelo canoso se presentó ante una corte criminal en el norte de china flanqueado por oficiales que una vez obedecieron sus orígenes se trataba de zhou yongkang el funcionario más alto del partido que era sometido juicio por corrupción en toda la historia de la china comunista durante años este sujeto había sido el hombre más temido de china controlaba la policía los paramilitares las prisiones las operaciones de inteligencia pero en el año medio en que desapareció de la vida pública volvió aparecer en la corte el hombre de 72 años había perdido su postura gallarda el color de su cabello ahora era blanco del sistema de seguridad que él mismo había establecido cuando xi jinping subió poder en 2012 prometió público una campaña que empuñaría una espada contra la corrupción atrapando tanto tigres como moscas zhou fue uno de los mayores tigres acepto la sentencia apelaré doy cuenta de los crímenes que cometido lo que costado partido declaró la caída de otro tigre bo xilai también fue notoria tanto él como zhou estaban acusados de conspirar juntos junto con dos altas figuras militares otro importante político de arruinar la unidad del partido el juicio de zhou se llevó cabo la mitad del primer período del gobierno de xi la campaña de choque asombro estaba en camino con una serie de juicios de importantes figuras de propaganda de honradez para acompañar la imagen de una nueva cultura política disciplinada frugal xi trataba de evitar banquetes veces viajaba en camioneta con colegas en lugar de una flota de limusinas en los últimos cinco años el mensaje de xi ha sido se unan partido si quieren ganar dinero pero su problema era todavía es que esto es precisamente lo que los 90 millones de miembros del partido esperan cuando se unen éste la política del partido comunista menudo ha funcionado con un sobre de billetes un favor un patrocinio limpiar esto significa sólo retirar individuos sino redes completas de influencia toda una cultura xi regresó sus raíces en el pueblo donde vivió en una cueva para codearse con campesinos se ha esforzado por dejar en claro el contraste de su propia vida la de una élite corrupta pero xi de 64 años siempre ha pertenecido la élite en los años previos que asumiera la presidencia algunos de sus familiares se hicieron increíblemente ricos aunque hay evidencia de que él buscara promover los intereses empresariales de su familia zhou yongkang había sido miembro del partido durante medio siglo escaló la jerarquía de la mayor compañía petrolera china coronó su carrera con un alto cargo en el partido el control del sistema de seguridad tenía una red formidable de patrocinadores cuando lo llevaron juicio xi había disuelto esa red investigando todos sus empleados choferes cocineros se decidió sentenciarlo cadena perpetua pero zhou sólo era corrupto también pertenecía una facción rival del partido cuyo poder desafiaba de xi todos se dieron cuenta entonces de que en la era de xi si pierdes pierdes todo encarcelar cientos de poderosos tigres en las altas filas del partido del ejército xi rompió el reglamento que mantenía una paz frágil entre la élite comunista tras la muerte de mao china ahora está alerta las desapariciones repentinas como la de xiao jianhua un multimillonario de 45 años con vínculos las familias más importantes del país que se esfumó de su apartamento de lujo en hong kong en enero de 2017. desde entonces se le se cree que está en custodia en china territorial en una advertencia los demás de que el dinero las conexiones un pasaporte canadiense son suficientes para protegerte del largo brazo de xi la purga ha continuado en los 5 años del régimen de xi se ha reforzado la impresión de que la corrupción en el partido es un problema sistemático perdurable pero todas las investigaciones de corrupción de los últimos años han sido conducidas en secreto el partido comunista chino sigue siendo una organización opaca aunque se ha comprometido limpiar los delitos xi ha mostrado ninguna disposición para permitir que la surja la verdad en la corte en alguna otra plataforma pública una otra vez el partido ha descubierto que el poder corrompe el poder absoluto corrompe de forma absoluta pero xi está determinado dirigir él solo la limpieza de camaradas el encarcelamiento de los tigres hubo otro juicio en el que el acusado era un tigre despiadado del partido comunista sino un abogado apacible sus convicciones sonaban similares los valores socialistas básicos que apoyaba xi jinping pero estaba punto de ser encarcelado por la audacia de haber actuado sin la aprobación del partido xu zhiuong de 40 años había comenzado su carrera como erudito pero se convirtió en representante de los perdedores del milagro económico de china incluidos los trabajadores migrantes los indigentes justo cuando xi asumió el poder el abogado estaba ayudando establecer el movimiento nuevos ciudadanos cuyo objetivo era unir pueblo través de una identidad cívica común la acusación en su contra era haber reunido una multitud para perturbar el orden público en una declaración en la corte señaló que la constitución china prometía los ciudadanos la libertad de expresión pesar de trabajar favor de las causas más cercanas xi jinping la rectitud en el servicio público un mejor trato para los pobres xu zhiyong pasaría en la cárcel el primer período de xi en el poder su sentencia fue decretada el 26 de enero de 2014. pocas semanas antes xi viajó mausoleo del presidente mao en la plaza de tiananmen en pekín xi hizo tres reverencias frente sarcófago de vidrio donde descanse el cuerpo de mao para conmemorar el 120 aniversario de su nacimiento parecer importa que las políticas de mao condujeron una hambruna muerte de más de 30 millones de chinos que la propia familia de xi haya sido perseguida en la última década de la revolución cultural con xi jinping en el poder preocuparse por los hechos inconvenientes de la historia insultar los héroes mártires revolucionarios ahora es un delito punible llamado nihilismo histórico el retrato de mao todavía está ubicado en la plaza de tiananmen xi como hijo de uno de los camaradas revolucionarios de mao se ha colocado en la línea directa de sucesión ha prometido público que china será rica fuerte cree que la unidad la disciplina bajo el régimen de un solo partido es crucial para lograrlo la educación de élite de xi en su infancia seguida de los terrores de la revolución cultural le enseñaron temerle una ciudadanía politizada otro capítulo formativo de xi fue el colapso del comunismo en el bloque soviético su análisis fue que moscú había perdido su sentido de propósito cuando renunció su historia revolucionaria en un discurso sus camaradas del partido poco después de asumir el poder advirtió proporcionalmente el partido comunista soviético tenía más miembros de los que tenemos nosotros pero ninguno de ellos fue suficientemente hombre para levantarse resistir la resistencia de xi ante el poder seductor de los valores liberales ha sido feroz si nuestro pueblo puede defender los valores morales que se han formado desarrollado en nuestra tierra en lugar de ello repite de forma indiscriminada ciega los valores morales de occidente entonces será necesario cuestionar de forma genuina si perderemos nuestro ethos independiente como país como pueblo dijo xi una nación de ciudadanos activos es la pesadilla de xi activistas cristianos musulmanes laborales blogueros reporteros feministas abogados han sido encarcelados por hablar actuar sobre sus convicciones en algunos casos también han sido exhibidos en confesiones televisadas en las que se retractan de sus creencias repiten la línea del partido de que se han convertido en los peones de los enemigos de china en occidente xi desea que sus ciudadanos se identifiquen con la madre patria la nación raza china la cultura china el camino socialista chino es lo que llama cuatro identificaciones que ha sintetizado en dos consignas clave el gran rejuvenecimiento de la nación china del sueño chino estas consignas están en todas partes desde carteleras sobre las carreteras estaciones hasta documentales de televisión dibujos animados en internet aplicaciones móviles durante siglos los emperadores de china se esforzaron por equilibrar los principios de poder blanco el poder duro -ellos lo llamaron fuerza virtud- ejercitando autoridad absoluta sobre los sujetos la vez reconociendo su deber de asistencia pública celebrar la historia comunista de china xi ha sido cuidadoso equilibrar la reverencia por el presidente mao con una deferencia similar reformista económico que lo sucedió deng xiaoping xi habla de marxismo habla sobre mercados pero la esencia de su consigna de sueño chino es clara el sueño es una nación firme cualquiera sueño diferente como el de xu zhiyong con su visión de identidad cívica compartida es peligroso el activista fue liberado en julio después de completar una sentencia de cuatro años desde entonces se le ha podido contactar es posible pretender que este es sólo otro gran jugador este es el mayor jugador en la historia del mundo declaró en 2012 el líder de singapur lee kuan yew sobre el ascenso de china convertirse en líder en 2012 xi puso los ojos de china en el premio para el 100º aniversario de la fundación del partido comunista en 2021 china será moderadamente próspera para el 100º aniversario de la llegada de los comunistas poder en 2049 será una nación totalmente desarrollada rica poderosa china está en camino convertirse en la economía dominante del mundo si se le mide de acuerdo la paridad de poder adquisitivo la economía china pronto será 40 % más grande que la de estados unidos para 2049 podría ser tres veces más grande las pasadas cuatro décadas han sido un viaje extraordinario sólo para china sino para el hombre que la dirige xi era sólo un adolescente que vivía en una cueva cuando un presidente de estados unidos nixon se reunió con el presidente mao en 1972. cuando la puerta de occidente se abrió unos centímetros una década más tarde algunos de los principitos de la generación de xi aprovecharon la oportunidad para salir del país pero xi para entonces ya se había trazado un rumbo distinto según el recuento de su amigo en el cable de wikileaks sabía que fuera del país sería especial xi se muestra seguro de sí mismo en sus encuentros con extranjeros una vez sobre los que dan lecciones china en derechos humanos dijo hay algunos extranjeros que están aburridos con el estómago lleno que tienen nada mejor qué hacer que nos apuntan con el dedo primero china exporta revolución segundo china exporta hambre ni pobreza tercero china llega te provoca un dolor de cabeza ¿qué más se puede decir ? la china que xi heredó estaba lista para tener una visión más segura de sí misma él la ha aportado desde la construcción de islas en el disputado mar de china meridional hasta los nuevos bancos multilaterales los proyectos de infraestructura de la iniciativa del cinturón ruta de la seda el mandatario ha abandonado la máxima de que china debe ocultar su fortaleza esperar que llegue su momento xi también ha explotado hábilmente el retiro del presidente donald trump de un importante acuerdo comercial del acuerdo de cambio climático de parís se ha presentado sí mismo como el estadista del momento para incrementar la influencia de su país en el mundo un torbellino de carisma así fue como un documental de televisión reciente describió su política exterior para marcar sus primeros cinco años en el poder una serie paralela representó con gráficos su campaña contra la corrupción pero si xi quiere lograr sus objetivos centenarios todavía debe enfrentar el verdadero desafío la fortaleza en la superficie esconde profundos problemas económicos el crecimiento general se está ralentizando la deuda está incrementándose muchos economistas advierten que se está acabando el tiempo para las reformas que podrían solucionar los problemas de china sin una crisis detrás de la fachada de unidad ideológica están compitiendo muchas ideas sobre el futuro de china el partido sin embargo ha sobrevivido muchas crisis en la vida de xi desde la gran hambruna de mao hasta la revolución cultural el aplastamiento del movimiento pro democracia de 1989. xi dijo una vez una espada se fabrica en una piedra de afilar un hombre se forja en las dificultades la china de xi hasta ahora ha combinado gran riqueza con gran represión si continúa encerrando sus tigres limpiando sus camaradas silenciando las voces discordantes otros podrían plantearse las preguntas existenciales
